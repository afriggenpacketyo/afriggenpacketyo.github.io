          <p>The U.S. and Australia have formalized a significant agreement to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to counter China's global market dominance. The deal outlines a pipeline of projects valued at up to $8.5 billion, with an initial joint investment of $1 billion over the next six months. This strategic partnership will fund new mining and processing facilities in both countries, directly addressing the dependency on China for materials essential to defense, technology, and manufacturing sectors. The collaboration is designed to create a more secure and resilient resource supply for Western allies.</p>

The firm plans to advocate for exploring options to enhance shareholder value, including potential improvements to capital allocation and a possible merger of Cooper's contact lens business with rival Bausch + Lomb. News of the activist involvement caused Cooper's shares to rise by 4%, signaling investor optimism about potential restructuring. The move comes after Cooper recently lowered its revenue forecast, and its stock has declined significantly this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former New York corrections officer, David Kingsley, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in the death of inmate Robert Brooks at Marcy Correctional Facility. However, two other officers, Matthew Galliher and Nicholas Kieffer, were acquitted of all charges, prompting disappointment from the governor and outrage from activists. The incident, captured on body-worn cameras, showed Brooks being beaten to death within an hour of his arrival at the prison. Community organizers condemned the verdict as insufficient justice, highlighting a systemic issue of violence within the prison system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to announce a critical minerals deal, President Trump suggested that China does not intend to invade Taiwan. He characterized the AUKUS security pact as a deterrent he thinks will not be needed and stated that Beijing has been "very respectful" to the United States. This perspective contrasts with the strategic intent of the minerals agreement, which is designed to reduce Western reliance on China. Trump's comments create a mixed message, simultaneously forging alliances to counter China's economic power while publicly minimizing its military threat in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated two assistant U.S. attorneys in Virginia, Kristin Bird and Elizabeth Yusi, who reportedly objected to the prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James. This action is part of a broader series of dismissals within the Eastern District of Virginia office, which has seen the ouster of several high-ranking officials. The firings raise concerns about political influence within the Justice Department, as the office is simultaneously pursuing politically sensitive cases, including one against former FBI Director James Comey. The move creates uncertainty about who will represent the government in James's upcoming arraignment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis projects that costs for employer-provided health insurance are set to increase by 6% to 7% in 2026, a rate more than double the current level of inflation. This surge is attributed to an aging workforce utilizing more medical services and a higher demand for expensive treatments, including popular weight-loss drugs. For employees, this means higher paycheck deductions, with average annual costs potentially reaching $2,400 for single coverage and $8,900 for families. The rising premiums, along with potentially higher deductibles and co-pays, are expected to add significant financial pressure on American households already grappling with inflation.</p>

It calls for Europe to act as a crucial counterweight by providing financial and military resources, such as using frozen Russian assets for a loan to Kyiv.

This move comes after the UN's International Maritime Organization postponed a vote on the tax following strong opposition from the Trump administration.

          <p>The recent brazen theft of crown jewels from the Louvre is the latest in a long series of security breaches at the world-famous museum. This article recounts the institution's history of heists, most famously the 1911 snatching of the Mona Lisa, which catapulted the painting to global fame. Other significant thefts include a diamond-studded sword in 1976 and paintings by Renoir and Corot, many of which were never recovered. These recurring incidents highlight the persistent security challenges faced by the museum, even as it prepares for a major renovation project aimed at upgrading its protective systems.</p>

          <p>In his upcoming memoir, Kevin Federline, the ex-husband of Britney Spears, details his perspective on their turbulent relationship and her behavior as a mother. The book reportedly includes allegations of substance use during her pregnancy and other erratic actions that he claims made their sons fearful. Federline also expresses ongoing concern for Spears's well-being and states he was supportive of the conservatorship that controlled her life for years. Spears has condemned the book, accusing Federline of attempting to profit from her story and describing the claims as hurtful.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, a move intended to allow officers to concentrate on actual criminal offenses. This policy change was confirmed as the Met dropped its investigation into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The force's commissioner stated that police should not be involved in policing "toxic culture war debates." Non-crime hate incidents are acts perceived as hostile but do not meet the criminal threshold, and their recording by police has been a subject of free speech debates.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the nationwide "No Kings" demonstrations, arguing that the massive, peaceful, and often humorous protests against the Trump administration may represent a new political posture in America. Despite Republican leaders branding them as "Hate America" rallies and predicting violence, the events were largely cheerful and non-confrontational. The author suggests that the diverse coalition of protesters, united by their opposition to Trump, is forging a left-liberal popular front that blends principle with irreverence. This movement aims to restore democratic norms that would allow for political disagreement without resorting to authoritarian tactics.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including the one of General Robert E. Lee that sparked deadly riots in Charlottesville. The show aims to re-contextualize these controversial figures by presenting them as artifacts of a racist ideology rather than heroic monuments. One statue of Lee has been melted down into bronze ingots, while others are displayed alongside contemporary art that critiques their historical narrative. The exhibition confronts the "Lost Cause" ideology and comes at a time of national debate over the preservation and interpretation of such historical symbols.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the agency responsible for safeguarding the U.S. nuclear stockpile, will temporarily lay off approximately 1,400 employees due to the ongoing government shutdown. This is the first time the NNSA has had to furlough workers since its creation in 2000, leaving fewer than 400 staff to manage critical national security functions. While officials assert the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, the furloughs are expected to hinder efforts to modernize older weapons. The shutdown, now in its 20th day, has left thousands of federal workers on unpaid leave or working without pay.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he would be open to joining a potential summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, following a reportedly tense meeting at the White House. Media reports suggest the meeting was acrimonious, with the U.S. side allegedly pressuring Ukraine to accept Russia's terms, including surrendering the Donbas region. Zelenskyy described his discussion with Trump as "frank," emphasizing his goal is a just peace, not a quick one. His conditional willingness for tripartite talks comes as he faces immense pressure to make concessions to end the war.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the federal law that prohibits users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms.

This same law was used to convict Hunter Biden before he was pardoned. The court's decision will have significant implications for Second Amendment rights, forcing the justices to weigh historical precedents against modern drug laws in light of their 2022 Bruen ruling.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut is set to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations across the UK, resulting in 1,210 job losses, after its main franchisee, DC London Pie Limited, fell into administration. This marks the second time the UK restaurant business has faced insolvency in less than a year. However, Pizza Hut's global parent company, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to acquire 64 sites, a move that will preserve 1,276 jobs. The casual dining chain has struggled with increased competition from more upmarket pizza brands and rising operational costs in a challenging consumer market.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that despite recent negative attention, Katie Porter's campaign for California governor should not be counted out. Porter faced criticism for ending a TV interview abruptly and for a leaked video showing her berating a staffer, leading rivals to call her unfit to lead. However, the author contends that voters, particularly Democrats, may forgive her temper if they value her reputation as a tenacious fighter who holds corporations accountable. In an era where voters seek strong leaders to challenge the political status quo, her perceived toughness could ultimately be an asset rather than a liability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have provided strong evidence that cannabis can be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain. In one study, a full-spectrum cannabis oil blend containing THC and CBD performed better than a placebo in reducing pain. The second study found that the same cannabis tincture offered better pain relief and caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects than opioids. These findings are considered groundbreaking by U.S. researchers, as large-scale trials are difficult to conduct domestically due to federal regulations, and they may pave the way for new pain management alternatives.</p>

          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While costs have risen, industry sales and production have held up better than expected, leading to upward revisions in vehicle sales forecasts. However, headwinds persist, including slowing consumer income growth, stress in the subprime auto loan market, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The sector is navigating a delicate balance, with corporate gains from deregulation helping to offset the financial impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the audacious heist at the Louvre, art security experts speculate that the priceless French crown jewels are unlikely to be sold intact on the black market. Because the pieces are historically significant and highly identifiable, thieves will likely break them apart to sell the individual precious metals and gemstones separately. This process would destroy their immeasurable cultural heritage value but make the materials easier to monetize. The article draws parallels to other major art thefts, such as the 2019 Dresden Green Vault heist, where organized crime networks targeted objects with high material value.</p>

Giuffre also recounts the psychological and physical torment she endured from Epstein, who she says trafficked her to powerful men. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations, though he reached a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022.</p>
