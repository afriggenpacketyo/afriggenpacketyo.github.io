        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has strongly condemned an appeals court decision that ruled most of Trump's tariffs illegal, labeling it "weaponized partisan injustice." Navarro warned that if the Supreme Court upholds the ruling, it would be "the end of the United States," echoing Trump's own dire predictions. The administration remains optimistic about its appeal, but the ruling places a key component of its economic agenda in jeopardy, challenging the president's authority to impose such sweeping levies. This article also clarifies that tariff revenue claims have been exaggerated and that American consumers largely bear the cost of these duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an urgent lawsuit filed by lawyers for the children. The judge justified the extraordinary 14-day restraining order by noting the government's plan was being executed during the "wee hours" of a holiday weekend. The administration argued it was repatriating children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys who cited U.S. laws protecting vulnerable minors.</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey addressed the question of what would happen if all Americans became debt-free, arguing the economy would not collapse but could actually improve. He posits that debt-free individuals do not stop spending; instead, they engage in more responsible spending because they have more disposable income. Ramsey stated that while lenders and finance companies would suffer, the balance of power would shift back to consumers. He believes the economy thrives on people controlling their own income, which also leads to increased generosity, rather than being dependent on a cycle of borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced plans to expand its immigration crackdown in Chicago by dedicating more resources to ongoing ICE operations. The move has been met with strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have vowed to resist what Pritzker termed a potential "invasion." In response to the federal plans, Mayor Johnson signed an order prohibiting Chicago police from assisting federal agents with civil immigration enforcement. The announcement escalates tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic leaders of so-called "sanctuary cities."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 in a crucial early-season Premier League match, striking a significant psychological blow against their expected title challengers. The decisive moment came from a brilliant 83rd-minute free-kick by Dominik Szoboszlai, which broke the deadlock in a largely defensive game. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative approach was criticized as a missed opportunity, as his team rarely threatened the Liverpool goal.

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's plan for a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, calling on everyone to "stand up" to the president. Pritzker labeled the potential deployment of federal troops as an "invasion," arguing there is no emergency to justify such an action and that it would be illegal. He criticized the lack of communication from the White House and asserted that the move is politically motivated rather than a genuine effort to fight crime. The governor also accused the administration of having ulterior motives related to controlling future elections.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order that would mandate identification for all voters in U.S. elections, stating there will be "NO EXCEPTIONS!" This move is expected to face immediate legal challenges, as the U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president. The push for stricter voter ID laws stems from Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Critics argue such laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters, who are less likely to possess the required forms of identification.</p>

          <p>A developing sports scandal at Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance has led to the firing of its football coach, Ed Hodgkiss. The school is facing repercussions after five transfer students were declared ineligible and the team had to forfeit a major game due to a lack of players. The article suggests the Archdiocese of Los Angeles failed to learn from a similar, recent scandal at another Catholic school involving attempts to rapidly improve a football program with questionable transfers. It calls the situation a preventable mess that indicates a lack of oversight.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the infection during her pregnancy. Health officials are using this tragic event to underscore the critical importance of the maternal whooping cough vaccine, which provides passive immunity to newborns in their first weeks of life. The death comes amid growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake for various childhood diseases across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the financial and legal predicament faced by employees who are laid off just months before they are eligible for retirement benefits. It highlights the difficult decision between accepting a severance package, which typically requires waiving the right to sue, and pursuing legal action for lost benefits. The piece advises individuals to carefully calculate the long-term value of their pension, 401(k) matches, and healthcare coverage, as these can often far exceed the offered severance. It warns that while proving a company fired someone specifically to avoid paying benefits is challenging, it may be the only viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is pushing back against President Donald Trump's sharp criticism of crime in Baltimore, stating, "I have no interest in fighting with the president, but I have an interest in fighting for my communities." The feud escalated after Trump called the city a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore dismissed as a "performative" and unserious approach to policing. Moore touted recent drops in crime as evidence of a turnaround story and argued that arrogant criticism from the White House is unhelpful.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers discussed a range of new potential measures to bolster support for Ukraine amid its ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were imposing secondary sanctions on countries and entities that help Russia's war effort, a move that could significantly increase economic pressure. Other proposals included inviting Ukrainian defense companies to establish production facilities within the EU and exploring more aggressive uses of frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. These discussions reflect the EU's search for more impactful ways to sustain Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, a match widely described as one of the worst in recent memory. Rangers showed defensive resilience, a positive for beleaguered manager Russell Martin, but lacked any offensive threat. Celtic, meanwhile, were criticized for a "powder-puff" performance, failing to create meaningful chances and looking creatively void in attack. While the point takes Celtic to the top of the league table, the performance has raised serious concerns about the team's current form under manager Brendan Rodgers.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread and sometimes violent protests, Indonesia's political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for lawmakers. The nationwide demonstrations have been fueled by various grievances, including a controversial new monthly allowance for politicians that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. President Prabowo Subianto announced the concessions but also ordered a strong security response to any looting or property damage. The unrest, which escalated after the death of a driver during a protest, marks the first major challenge to Prabowo's presidency.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vibrant underwater forest off the coast of Southern California. The project, led by The Bay Foundation, involved an army of divers who smashed over 5.8 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp beds, creating barren underwater landscapes. By clearing 80 acres of the sea floor, the team allowed the fast-growing kelp to return, restoring a critical habitat for over 800 marine species. The effort serves as a powerful model for ecosystem restoration.</p>
