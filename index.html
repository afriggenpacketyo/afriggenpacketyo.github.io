          <p>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia does not intend to provide Iran with nuclear warheads, clarifying earlier remarks that suggested other nations might assist Iran in its nuclear program after alleged U.S. strikes. Medvedev emphasized that Russia, unlike Israel, adheres to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. His statement followed criticism from Donald Trump, who questioned Medvedev's casual mention of nuclear weapons. Andrea Sticker from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies suggested Medvedev's initial claim was likely an exaggeration, as no country would risk providing nuclear devices to Iran due to potential U.S. retaliation. </p>

This downward trend is attributed to increasing competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities.

          <p>The internet is abuzz with discussions about age-gap relationships, sparked by the recent pairing of Anna Camp, 42, and Jade Whipkey, 24. While Camp defends the maturity and compatibility of her partner, the article explores the societal rules and judgments surrounding such relationships. It cautions against relationships involving significant power imbalances, such as those between adults and minors, or those where one partner consistently dates individuals much younger. The author suggests that repeated patterns of dating only younger individuals may indicate immaturity or other personal issues. </p>

They expressed a desire for the party to be more inclusive and proactive in combating the Trump administration's policies. DNC Chair Ken Martin maintains that the party is focused on supporting working families and opposing Trump's agenda, while others suggest the resignations stem from disagreements over the DNC leadership. </p>

They can also be practical, particularly in open-plan spaces where they can act as both seating and room dividers. When selecting a curvy couch, it's important to consider size, comfort, and material, and to pair it with more angular tables and chairs for a balanced aesthetic. </p>
