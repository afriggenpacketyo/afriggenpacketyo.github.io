          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is expected to strengthen to Category 2 before gradually weakening later in the week. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are confident that the storm will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands, posing no immediate threat to land as it moves westward. The eastern Pacific has already experienced several named storms this season.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying its airlines about their future needs for Boeing jets, signaling a potential boost in orders if US-China trade relations improve. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) specifically inquired about overdue Boeing orders and future fleet plans. This development coincides with a meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president, where they discussed expanding cooperation. Industry insiders suggest that Boeing could be a primary beneficiary of any warming in diplomatic and trade ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that requires open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a firm whose CEO is a Trump ally, was a publicity stunt. The decision upholds the FOMC's long-standing practice of conducting its policy meetings in private.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal negotiated between the European Union and the United States has been met with downbeat responses from Europe's largest economies, France and Germany. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the agreement would "substantially damage" his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called it a "submission." The deal involves a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the US in exchange for Europe increasing its purchases of American energy. While many EU leaders expressed relief that an all-out trade war was averted, the overall sentiment across the bloc was one of resignation rather than celebration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic analysis of the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union suggests the deal is "asymmetric and unbalanced," heavily favoring the United States. Under the terms, the average U.S. tariff on EU imports will surge to 17.5%, which is projected to reduce the EU's annual GDP by 0.2%. In contrast, U.S. exports to the EU will face no tariffs, and the EU has committed to significant energy purchases and investments in the U.S. Experts believe the EU accepted the unfavorable terms to avoid a potentially more damaging trade war with higher tariffs.

The article contends that the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election is overwhelming and was confirmed by a bipartisan Senate report.

          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California undergraduates for the fall 2025 term, according to new data. The university admitted over 100,000 first-year students from California, increasing the in-state admission rate to 77%. The data also shows continued growth in racial diversity and the number of first-generation students, despite nationwide challenges to diversity programs. The university also increased offers to international and out-of-state students to offset an expected lower enrollment rate from these groups due to higher tuition and other factors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Brian Niccol's tenure as CEO of Starbucks suggests the coffee giant's recovery is a more complex challenge than his celebrated turnaround of Chipotle. While Niccol quickly restored Chipotle's reputation after a food-safety crisis, Starbucks faces a wider array of issues, including operational bottlenecks from mobile orders, labor unrest, and intense competition in China. Consequently, Starbucks' stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since Niccol took charge. Analysts note that while Chipotle had one major problem to fix, Starbucks has numerous medium-sized issues that make for a slower and potentially more expensive revitalization.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has presented a new European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland. The proposal was developed in coordination with leaders from France and Germany after U.S.-led negotiations broke down. While details of the plan have not been released, it reportedly aims to provide immediate relief and establish a pathway to a sustainable two-state solution. The move comes amid increasing pressure on the UK government to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a step supported by over half of the Labour party's backbench MPs.</p>

          <p>Two prominent Israeli human rights organizations, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have formally accused the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In a joint report, the groups allege that Israel's actions constitute a "coordinated, deliberate action to destroy Palestinian society," citing mass killings, the creation of catastrophic living conditions, and the systematic destruction of infrastructure. This marks the first time major voices within Israeli civil society have leveled such an accusation. An Israeli government spokesperson dismissed the report's claims as "baseless."</p>

The forecast, which models how global trade could be reconfigured, suggests this decline will be larger than the total drop in global exports to the U.S. The model also predicts that countries deeply integrated with China's manufacturing economy, like Vietnam and South Korea, will also see significant export declines. Conversely, North American partners like Canada and Mexico are projected to see increased exports to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts suggest that while a rate cut is not expected this week, comments from the Fed, future inflation data, and global tensions could still influence prices.

          <p>A legal challenge has been launched against the appointment of Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. The motion, filed by a defendant in a criminal case, argues her appointment violates federal law and that the prosecution lacks legal authority. The challenge follows a complex series of events where federal judges initially tried to replace Habba, only to have their chosen successor fired by the Attorney General. This allowed the administration to reappoint Habba, a move her critics contend is an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial and constitutional authority.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team has asked a federal court to order an expedited deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, citing his advanced age of 94 and alleged recent health issues. The request is part of Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp. The lawsuit stems from an article that claimed Trump wrote a "bawdy" letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which the president asserts is fake. Trump's lawyers argue that Murdoch's potential unavailability for a future trial makes a swift deposition necessary to preserve his testimony.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue allowing Planned Parenthood clinics to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their services nationwide. The order blocks a provision in a recent bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by ending its Medicaid payments for one year. In her ruling, Judge Indira Talwani stated that restricting access to care at Planned Parenthood would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. The ruling provides a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the reproductive health organization amid numerous political and legal battles.</p>
