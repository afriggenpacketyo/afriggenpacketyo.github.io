          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use in pregnancy and autism, according to reports. Federal health officials may warn pregnant women against using the painkiller unless necessary for a fever, while also highlighting a form of folate as a potential treatment. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has disputed these claims, stating there is no proven link and noting the lack of safe alternatives for fever reduction during pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration maintains that acetaminophen is safe when used as directed under medical supervision.</p>

While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the National Hurricane Center predicts the storm could undergo rapid strengthening. Swells generated by Gabrielle are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada, into early next week. The hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons program as a realistic interim measure. In an interview, Lee argued that halting the production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually is a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could lead to renewed talks, which would benefit South Korea and global security. This pragmatic approach marks a shift from previous policies aimed at immediate and total dismantlement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 16:49:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move the government sees as a significant opportunity for economic growth. The plan involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While supporters tout job creation and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups concerned about increased noise, pollution, and climate impact.

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known as F390 and mother to two 14-month-old cubs, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in Orange County. The cubs, who were still dependent on their mother for learning crucial survival skills, are now orphaned at a critical stage of their development. Researchers from the UC Davis California Carnivores Program have successfully placed a GPS tracking collar on the female cub to monitor her progress. The incident highlights the significant threat that vehicle traffic poses to Southern California's mountain lion population and underscores the need for safe wildlife crossings.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has rejected former President Donald Trump's call for the United States to regain control of Bagram Air Base, which the U.S. vacated during its 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump had claimed discussions were underway and threatened "bad things" if the base was not returned, but a Taliban spokesman dismissed the assertions, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement. The spokesman emphasized that Afghanistan's territorial integrity is paramount and that ceding its soil is "out of the question." This exchange occurs despite ongoing, lower-level talks between the U.S. and the Taliban on other issues.</p>

          <p>A tactical shift by manager Pep Guardiola almost earned Manchester City a victory against Arsenal, but a 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, Guardiola switched to a highly defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half, ceding possession in an uncharacteristic move. This strategy held off Arsenal until the final moments, when Martinelli broke through to salvage a point for the home side. The result is seen as a blow to both teams' title hopes, leaving league leaders Liverpool as the primary beneficiaries.</p>

Currently located northeast of the Philippines, the storm is exhibiting features of a mature and extreme system, including a clear, symmetrical eye. Its immense strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and a lack of disruptive wind shear. Ragasa is expected to maintain its peak intensity for a short period before gradually weakening as it moves toward the South China Sea.</p>

He pointed to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 per month to less than 50,000, suggesting companies are reducing labor costs to protect margins amid rising input costs. He believes this trend is widespread across industries, with companies moving from "hoarding labor" post-pandemic to aggressively managing expenses. He noted the Fed's recent interest rate cut reflects an acknowledgment of this cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump seemed to dismiss concerns over new Pentagon rules that severely restrict journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters. When asked about the directive, which requires reporters to only use information officially authorized for release, Trump commented, "Nothing stops reporters." The new policy, implemented by Department of War head Pete Hegseth, has been condemned by press freedom advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism. The National Press Club argued that if news about the military must first be approved by the government, the public is only getting official propaganda.</p>

          <p>England has secured a 2-0 series win against Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, thanks to a decisive six-wicket victory in the final match. Chasing Ireland's target of 155, England was led by Jordan Cox, who scored a crucial 55 runs despite a knee injury sustained earlier in the field. England's bowlers, particularly spinner Adil Rashid with three wickets, had effectively contained the Irish batting lineup on a slow pitch. The victory was sealed by Tom Banton with 17 balls to spare, capping a successful series for the English side under stand-in skipper Jacob Bethell.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, calling it the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." The plan aims to permanently pedestrianize the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The event was popular with many pedestrians who enjoyed the safer, more relaxed atmosphere. However, the proposal faces opposition from some local councillors and residents who are concerned about increased traffic congestion on side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned public criticism from Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." Kushner had published a letter accusing Macron's government of insufficient action against antisemitism and linking French foreign policy to violence against Jews. Macron retorted that such public remarks violate diplomatic protocol and that a French ambassador would never be permitted to interfere in another country's internal affairs in such a manner. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner in a formal rebuke over his comments.</p>

          <p>Podcaster Joe Rogan recently cited a Washington Post article to suggest that Earth might be in a cooling period, a claim that was quickly debunked by experts. Meteorologist Chris Gloninger explained that while Earth was in a long-term natural cooling cycle, that trend was dramatically reversed by human activity over the last 150 years. He clarified that the current rate of warming, driven by carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, is unprecedented in human history. The incident highlights how scientific data can be easily misinterpreted and spread as misinformation, underscoring the importance of careful evaluation of climate-related claims.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting a widely used check-in and baggage system has caused significant travel disruptions across several major European airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels. The attack on the Muse software, provided by Collins Aerospace, forced airlines to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins, leading to hundreds of delays and long queues. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their departing flights for Monday, as there is no clear timeline for when the secure system will be restored.

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland athletics team has concluded the World Championships in Tokyo with its worst performance in nearly two decades. The team secured a total of five medals but failed to win a single gold for the first time since 2003, finishing 21st in the medal table. This result is a significant drop from the 10 medals won at the previous championships and the Paris Olympics. The team's fortunes were hampered by injuries to key athletes like Josh Kerr and Molly Caudery, and a failure to medal in any of the relay events.</p>

The tigers had been rehabilitated by the Amur Tiger Center. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be living in the wild.</p>

Donald believes that if the highly-paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on their own players.
