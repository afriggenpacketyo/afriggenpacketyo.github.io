          <p>Two women were seriously injured in Leeds following an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm, leading to the arrest of a 38-year-old man with a self-inflicted injury. Counter Terrorism Policing North East has taken over the investigation from West Yorkshire Police, who have secured the scene and recovered the weapons. Authorities believe there was no one else involved in the attack, but they are still working to determine the full circumstances and potential motives behind the shocking incident that took place on Otley Road. Businesses in the area closed early, and police are urging the public not to speculate or share information that could affect the active investigation.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team clinched their fourth consecutive Grand Slam and seventh straight Six Nations title with a narrow 43-42 victory over France. Despite leading 31-7 early in the match, England faced a strong comeback from France, who outscored them in the second half. England's head coach, John Mitchell, expressed satisfaction that his team had been tested before the upcoming Rugby World Cup. This win extends England's winning streak to 25 games and sets them up for a potential record-breaking run, although Mitchell is wary of repeating their previous World Cup final defeat.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term as US president has been marked by significant disruptions to global trade through tariff increases on various countries. After initially raising tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump implemented a broad package of tariff increases for both rivals and allies, causing widespread market instability. While he later paused some of these levies, the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China continue to fuel uncertainty and undermine confidence in the US's ability to manage the global economy. The unpredictable nature of Trump's trade policies has left businesses and investors struggling to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape.</p>

          <p>Following a problematic February bar exam, pressure is increasing on the State Bar of California to abandon its new multiple-choice questions and return to the traditional test format in July. Senator Thomas J. Umberg is advocating for a return to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) system, which California used since 1972, citing the recent exam's "catastrophe." The State Bar's decision to create its own questions was intended as a cost-cutting measure, but the February exam was marred by technical issues and irregularities, leading to calls for an independent review and concerns about the fairness and reliability of the new test.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in American confidence in Donald Trump, including among some Republicans, across various key issues. A majority of those surveyed described Trump's second term as "scary", with low ratings on the economy and immigration policy. A significant portion of Americans believe Trump is not focused on the right priorities, and his approval ratings are historically low for a leader this early in their term. These findings suggest growing public fatigue with Trump's policies and leadership style.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump, after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Pope Francis's funeral, has expressed doubts about Vladimir Putin's genuine desire for peace in Ukraine. Trump suggested that Putin's recent missile strikes on civilian areas indicate a lack of commitment to ending the war. This shift in Trump's perspective comes after months of skepticism towards Ukraine and could potentially signal a change in US policy towards the conflict. The Vatican meeting, facilitated by European leaders, may have played a crucial role in influencing Trump's views.</p>
