          <p>Actor Ryan Reynolds shared an anecdote about angering Denzel Washington while filming the 2012 movie "Safe House." During a pivotal, emotional scene where Washington's character was dying, Reynolds' cell phone rang with a Frank Sinatra ringtone, disrupting the take. Reynolds recalled humorously feigning ignorance and blaming the disruption on the stunt crew to deflect from his mistake. The incident highlights the intense focus required on a film set and the professional dynamics between actors during high-stakes scenes.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue refunds totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariffs. The administration has requested an expedited ruling after a federal appeals court found most of the "reciprocal tariffs" to be illegal. While Bessent expressed confidence in the administration's legal position, he acknowledged the significant financial disruption a negative ruling would cause for the Treasury. The White House is also reportedly preparing alternative plans, such as using Section 232 national security provisions to implement other levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels successfully struck Israel's Ramon International Airport near Eilat with a drone, breaching the country's air defenses. The attack caused limited damage to the passenger terminal, including shattered windows, and resulted in one man being treated for light shrapnel wounds. The Houthis claimed the strike as a "qualitative military operation" and warned that other sensitive targets are under threat. This event marks a notable escalation in the Houthis' long-range attacks against Israel, which they state are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth condemned President Trump's recent social media posts suggesting a military-style intervention in Chicago, stating he "essentially just declared war on a major city." Duckworth emphasized that such an action would constitute an illegal order and noted there are currently no indications of an actual troop deployment being prepared. She criticized the administration for not coordinating with local law enforcement, suggesting a lack of genuine interest in fighting crime. The senator's comments highlight the escalating political and legal tensions over the president's threats to use federal forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, asserted that the central bank's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence." His comments follow President Trump's public pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and his inclusion of Hassett on a shortlist to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Hassett warned that historical examples show political control over central banks often leads to inflation and economic hardship for consumers. The discussion underscores the ongoing debate about the White House's influence over the traditionally independent financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the Italian Grand Prix, McLaren instructed Oscar Piastri to yield second place to his teammate and championship rival, Lando Norris, sparking controversy. Norris had been running ahead of Piastri for most of the race until a slow pit stop, caused by a team equipment issue, dropped him behind. Citing team principles of fairness, McLaren management ordered the positions to be reverted, arguing Norris lost the spot through no fault of his own. While Piastri initially questioned the call, he complied, a decision that highlights the team's unique culture of prioritizing predetermined fairness over on-track racing incidents.</p>

The proposed legislation represents a significant overhaul of workers' rights, including a ban on "exploitative" zero-hours contracts and enhanced protections against unfair dismissal. Union leaders fear that economic pressures may tempt ministers to weaken the bill as a concession to business interests and have vowed to campaign fiercely against any such changes.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching two key events this week that could significantly impact the stock market: the release of major inflation data and Apple's annual hardware launch. Following a soft jobs report, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) will provide crucial insights into whether the Federal Reserve will proceed with anticipated interest rate cuts. On Tuesday, Apple is expected to unveil its iPhone 17 lineup, with analysts watching for potential price increases and features that could spark a new upgrade cycle. These events will test the market's current optimism regarding both monetary policy and the tech sector's growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has strongly criticized Vice President JD Vance for his remarks supporting the recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers. Vance had called the action the "highest and best use of our military," a sentiment Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless." As chair of the Senate homeland security committee, Paul condemned the idea of glorifying extrajudicial killings without a trial or due process. This public disagreement highlights a significant rift within the Republican party over the administration's aggressive new policy of using lethal military force against non-state actors in the "war on drugs."</p>

While both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, New Zealand's comprehensive victory served as revenge for a loss to Ireland in the previous year's WXV1 tournament.

The test, which took place at 3:00 PM on Sunday, was designed to ensure the system's effectiveness in warning the public about life-threatening events like severe weather or public health crises. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test a success and an important step in national safety preparedness. The system has been used for real warnings five times since its first test, including for storms and the discovery of an unexploded WWII bomb.</p>

The 51-year-old man was tracked to his home after the vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 car, was seen driving on the D4 motorway. The driver's identity had previously been obscured by his racing helmet, preventing police from pressing charges. He now faces fines and a potential license suspension for operating a vehicle on a public road that lacks headlights, indicators, and number plates, bringing an end to the mystery of the "phantom racer."</p>

          <p>Jarvis McKenzie, a Black man who was shot at and racially threatened in South Carolina, is publicly calling for the state to pass a hate crime law. South Carolina is one of only two states without such legislation, which would allow for enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice. The alleged attacker was charged under a limited local ordinance, but a statewide law would carry much more significant consequences. The bill has passed the state's House but has stalled in the Republican-led Senate, despite support from business leaders and survivors of the 2015 Charleston church massacre.</p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of AI in the workplace is predicted to eliminate many entry-level positions, raising questions about the future of career progression. With tasks traditionally performed by junior employees being automated, the first rung on the corporate ladder may disappear for many, making it harder to gain institutional knowledge and advance. Data from 2019 to 2024 already shows a 50% decline in new roles for recent graduates at major tech firms. This trend could fundamentally reshape corporate structures, forcing a shift from a linear career ladder to a flatter organization and requiring new graduates to acquire advanced skills independently.

In her new year-long position, Baerbock will chair and manage UN meetings, facilitate discussions among the 193 member states, and play a role in preparing for next year's election of a new Secretary-General.
