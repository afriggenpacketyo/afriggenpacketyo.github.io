          <p>President Donald Trump publicly called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to immediately halt missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine, expressing his disapproval of the ongoing strikes. Trump stated that the attacks were "not necessary" and "very bad timing," emphasizing the need to finalize a peace deal. This statement marks a rare public reprimand from Trump towards Putin regarding the conflict in Ukraine, amidst escalating tensions and significant casualties on both sides.

          <p>The general manager of the McVitie's factory, where chocolate digestives have been produced for a century, suggests the biscuit should be eaten chocolate-side down. According to Anthony Coulson, this allows the chocolate to melt first, enhancing the flavor experience. Despite this recommendation, Coulson acknowledges that personal preference ultimately dictates how one enjoys the teatime staple. The factory produces approximately 80 million packets of chocolate digestives annually, with all the chocolate made in Greater Manchester, making this a popular and enduring debate.</p>

          <p>Merck has lowered its full-year profit guidance, citing an estimated $200 million impact from tariffs and a charge related to its licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma.

While the revised outlook doesn't account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., Merck is investing in domestic manufacturing and research and development.

          <p>The U.S. Army has suspended the commander of Fort McCoy in Wisconsin after portraits of Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth were found turned to face the wall. While the Army stated that the suspension is not related to misconduct, an investigation has been launched to determine what occurred. The incident sparked controversy after photos of the altered portraits were posted on social media, prompting a swift response from the Department of Defense. The situation raises questions about political neutrality within the military and the handling of symbolic displays.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is considering introducing regional energy pricing, which could result in lower bills in areas that generate more energy. The "zonal pricing" scheme aims to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment. While some energy companies support the idea, others fear it could deter investment and lead to higher bills for some households. Miliband emphasized that no decision has been made and that the government's priority is to lower energy bills throughout the country, as they evaluate the complexities of reforming the energy market.</p>
