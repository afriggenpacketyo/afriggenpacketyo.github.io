          <p>President Trump is visiting Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have resulted in over 121 deaths, including dozens of children at a summer camp. His visit occurs amid scrutiny of the local and federal emergency response. Unlike his criticism of Democratic governors during other disasters, Trump has praised Texas's Republican Governor Greg Abbott, highlighting their close relationship. The administration is also defending against criticism regarding cuts to the National Weather Service and questions about the future of FEMA.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship from taking effect. The ruling prevents the administration from implementing the policy anywhere within the United States. This decision marks a significant legal setback for a key component of the president's immigration agenda. The brief announcement indicates that the policy is halted pending further legal proceedings, representing a major development in the ongoing debate over constitutional citizenship.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a newly discovered interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, as potentially the oldest comet ever observed, possibly predating our solar system by three billion years. This is only the third such object detected from beyond our solar system. Researchers from the University of Oxford believe it originated in an ancient part of the Milky Way, and its icy composition could create a spectacular glowing tail as it approaches the Sun later this year, making it visible with amateur telescopes.</p>

It draws parallels to Guus Hiddink's successful leadership of co-host South Korea in 2002, emphasizing his focus on creating the fittest team and fostering a unified, club-like atmosphere. While Pochettino faces different circumstances with players based globally, the historical example suggests that intense preparation and unity will be crucial for a strong performance on home soil.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that as the United States prepares to host major global sporting events like the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, its political direction creates a difficult situation for international sports. For decades, global sports sought to enter the lucrative American market to achieve worldwide legitimacy and growth. Now, they find themselves partnering with a nation whose increasingly isolationist and confrontational politics, including travel bans and trade disputes, conflict with the internationalist spirit of their events.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official has accused the Philippines of escalating tensions in the South China Sea through a series of "provocations," including attempts to occupy new maritime features and allowing the US to deploy a mid-range missile system. The official warned that Manila's actions are disrupting regional peace and that there is no sign of de-escalation. The article suggests that Beijing is concerned these actions could embolden other claimants in the disputed waters, such as Vietnam, to follow suit.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant sales boom in Norway, with new car registrations jumping 54% year-on-year in June, directly contrasting with a sales slump in other major European markets. This success, driven by the popular Model Y, persists even as many Norwegian consumers express political objections to CEO Elon Musk's public statements and actions. The trend underscores the strength of Norway's long-standing pro-EV policies, which have made it the world's most EV-friendly country. (not investment advice)</p>
