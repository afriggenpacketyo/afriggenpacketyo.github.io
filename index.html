            <p>The United States is considering ending its involvement in brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, due to a lack of significant progress. Rubio stated that the US has other priorities and will decide "in a matter of days" whether to continue the peace efforts. This comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue, and despite a potential minerals deal between the US and Ukraine. The US stance contrasts with earlier warnings about Russia's expansionist ambitions and the need for Western solidarity. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun releasing thousands of previously classified records related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. This action, supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to provide transparency but could reignite speculation about the circumstances of the killing. While local and FBI files have been available for decades, it's unclear if these federal records contain new information. Robert F.

            <p>A recent report details Elon Musk's efforts to expand his family through contracts with multiple women, raising questions about his approach to fatherhood and traditional family values. Musk reportedly offers significant financial incentives, including lump sums and monthly payments, in exchange for non-disclosure agreements from potential mothers. This has led to discussions about the difference between being pro-natalist and being pro-family, as Musk's arrangements seem to prioritize reproduction over traditional familial bonds.

            <p>Analysts are increasingly focusing on the 'diploma divide' – the political separation between those with and without a four-year college degree – as a key factor in modern elections. While some see this as a cleaner way to understand political shifts than traditional class-based analysis, others argue it risks overlooking the economic interests and grievances of the working class. Critics suggest that Democrats' focus on appealing to college-educated voters has alienated working-class voters and neglected substantive critiques of the modern economy.</p>

            <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may "move on" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.</p>

            <p>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison. Boasberg said the government "deliberately flouted" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses. As it pursues its appeal, the Justice Department has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to pause the district court's order, arguing that Boasberg's decision was "fundamentally misconceived from the start, needlessly prompting a constitutional confrontation over criminal contempt that never should have arisen."</p>

            <p>PBS initially postponed the broadcast of "Break the Game," a documentary about a trans video gamer, due to concerns about political backlash. However, after inquiries from the media, the network reversed its decision and scheduled the film for broadcast in June, coinciding with Pride Month. The incident highlights the pressures faced by public media organizations in the current political climate, with critics suggesting that PBS's initial self-censorship demonstrates a lack of courage in defending independent filmmaking.</p>
