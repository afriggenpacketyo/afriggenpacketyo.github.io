          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK is considering further charges against former neonatal nurse Lucy Letby following an extensive police investigation. The inquiry, dubbed Operation Hummingbird, examined additional baby deaths and non-fatal collapses at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Liverpool Women's Hospital. Letby is already serving multiple life sentences for the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of seven others. This development runs parallel to the arrest of three former senior hospital managers on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), Karen Kneller, has resigned after facing significant criticism over the organization's handling of wrongful conviction cases. Her departure follows intense scrutiny related to the case of Andrew Malkinson, who was exonerated after spending 17 years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. The CCRC had previously rejected Malkinson's case twice, leading a justice committee to accuse the organization of an inability to learn from its mistakes. The new chair, Dame Vera Baird, has pledged to restore public confidence in the vital institution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on President Trump's major legislative package focused on tax cuts and immigration after it narrowly passed the Senate. The bill includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts, new funding for border security, and repeals of Biden-era clean energy initiatives. However, it faces opposition from some fiscal conservatives due to its projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over the next decade. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also estimates that 11.8 million people could lose health insurance due to cuts in Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe heatwave is impacting much of Europe, leading to multiple deaths, school closures, and wildfires. Spain and France have each reported at least two fatalities, with a wildfire in Spain's Catalonia region claiming two lives. Record-setting temperatures are forcing authorities to issue public health warnings, while an EU official has criticized political leaders for a lack of action on climate change. While the heat has caused power outages in Italy and disruptions in major cities, forecasters expect thunderstorms to bring some relief to parts of the continent soon.</p>

          <p>A report has revealed that the fire at an electrical substation that caused a complete shutdown of London's Heathrow Airport was due to a fault first identified seven years ago. The investigation found that National Grid, the owner of the substation, was aware of elevated moisture levels in 2018 but repeatedly deferred necessary maintenance. The power failure in March disrupted over 270,000 journeys and cost airlines an estimated Â£80-Â£100 million. Energy regulator Ofgem has launched an investigation into National Grid, raising broader concerns about the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As countries like South Korea pivot towards stablecoins, questions arise about how they compare to central bank digital currencies like China's digital yuan. The digital yuan, or e-CNY, is a state-controlled currency intended primarily for small domestic retail payments and is not exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, backed by reserve assets. While the digital yuan operates under the central bank's authority, stablecoins represent a decentralized approach to digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent groundbreaking ceremony, significant questions remain about whether the Oakland Athletics' planned $1.75 billion stadium on the Las Vegas Strip will ever be built. Team owner John Fisher faces a substantial funding gap, rising construction costs that could push the total to $2 billion, and skepticism from sports economists. Fisher is relying on a $380 million public subsidy, a bank loan, and an equity sale, but still appears to be short hundreds of millions of dollars for the project. The complex saga has left the team temporarily playing in Sacramento, alienating multiple fanbases. (not investment advice)</p>

The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often designed to favor the existing two-party system. Establishing a national party would require immense financial resources to fund signature-gathering campaigns and withstand inevitable legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans.

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to restructure the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with plans that include budget cuts and loosening gun regulations. Staff from the Department of Government Efficiency have been working with the ATF to alter around 50 regulations, such as extending the validity of background checks and allowing dealers to destroy records sooner. The Justice Department has proposed a 25% budget cut for the agency, which would eliminate over 500 investigator positions. Critics warn these changes could weaken critical oversight of the firearms industry and hamper law enforcement's ability to trace crime guns.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill" proposes approximately $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) over the next decade, potentially reversing recent gains in health coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation could result in nearly 12 million more uninsured Americans by 2034. Key provisions include imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which could disqualify millions over paperwork issues, and making ACA enrollment more difficult. The plan would also allow states to charge higher copayments for some Medicaid services, raising concerns about access to care for low-income individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The quintessential American tradition of barbecue has its origins with the Indigenous TaÃ­no people of the Caribbean. The term itself evolved from the TaÃ­no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frame they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers in the 15th century observed this method and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first recorded in print in 1526. Over centuries, this cooking style and its name transformed as it spread, blending with local and immigrant influences across the U.S. to create the diverse regional barbecue styles known today.</p>

Critics pointed out the design's striking resemblance to traditional Kolhapuri chappals, handcrafted footwear from western India that dates back to the 12th century. In response to the outcry, a Prada executive acknowledged the sandals were inspired by the traditional Indian footwear and stated the design may not reach the market.

          <p>In a major NBA free agency surprise, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star guard Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will likely miss most or all of the upcoming season. Lillard will now be an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with any team while continuing his rehabilitation. The move signals a significant roster shake-up for both the Bucks and the Pacers, who are facing a season without their own injured star, Tyrese Haliburton.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, who was just convicted for a sexual assault and murder committed 58 years ago, will now be investigated in connection with other unsolved cold cases. Headley was found guilty of the 1967 killing of Louisa Dunne in Bristol after a DNA match was made from evidence preserved from the crime scene. He had also been convicted of other sexual assaults on elderly women in Ipswich in the 1970s. Police in Suffolk will now review his activities to see if he can be linked to other unsolved homicides and stranger attacks.</p>
