          <p>A federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without proper legal proceedings, just as flights were prepared for takeoff. The order came after lawyers argued the expedited deportations would bypass legal protections for minors and potentially expose them to abuse or persecution. The Justice Department confirmed 76 children were slated for removal, but the judge's 14-day temporary restraining order ensured they would be returned to the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. This ruling underscores ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies concerning vulnerable minors.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has significantly redecorated the Oval Office, applying numerous 'Trump touches' that include extensive gold detailing across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace. This 'goldening' has drawn mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a symbol of a new golden age for America, while others criticize it as 'vulgar' or 'gaudy'. The president reportedly paid for the high-quality gold personally and also increased the number of presidential paintings and personal memorabilia. This article highlights a long-standing tradition of presidents customizing the office, though Trump's aesthetic choices are noted for their distinctiveness.</p>

The convoy, carrying food, water, and medicine, seeks to challenge the maritime blockade imposed on Gaza since 2007. This marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza after a previous deportation by Israel. The mission highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with famine officially confirmed in Gaza in August, a claim Israel disputes, and raises international calls for a ceasefire and unfettered aid access.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a 'crime-free zone' on Truth Social, citing a significant drop in crime and a surge in arrests following his public safety emergency declaration. Over two weeks, Trump deployed National Guard troops and federal agents, including ICE personnel, to patrol the city. Preliminary data indicated a 40% reduction in robberies and auto break-ins, with over 700 arrests and 91 illegal firearms seized. This federal intervention represents a substantial increase in enforcement activity, with the administration touting its immediate impact on public safety in the capital.</p>

          <p>St. Mary's Academy, a Catholic school for young Black women in New Orleans, embodies a legacy of empowerment, achieving a 100% graduation and college admission rate for 19 consecutive years. The school's success is rooted in the vision of its foundress, Henriette Delille, a Creole nun who defied anti-literacy laws to educate non-White people in the 19th century. Despite facing challenges like rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina, the academy continues to instill in its students the belief that 'the sky is the limit.' This article highlights the school's profound impact, exemplified by alumni like Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, who recently made math history.</p>

          <p>Will Smith's pinch-hit, walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning rescued the Dodgers from a potential three-game sweep by the Arizona Diamondbacks, securing a crucial 5-4 victory. The win, despite a late-game three-run lead being blown by reliever Tanner Scott, moved the Dodgers two games up in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the team's need for 'pride' and 'fight,' which was ultimately delivered. Smith, who had been in a deep slump, found redemption with his 420-foot blast, highlighting the team's resilience as they enter the final month of the season.</p>

          <p>Sergio Gor, a close aide to Donald Trump who has published his books and raised millions for his campaign, has been appointed as the next U.S. Ambassador to India. This appointment comes at a time of strained U.S.-India relations due to Trump's tariffs. Gor's mandate also includes overseeing relations with other South and Central Asian countries, a move some Indian observers view as a potential overreach by Washington, especially concerning Pakistan. Experts debate whether Gor's closeness to Trump will be an asset in resolving policy logjams or if his limited diplomatic experience will further complicate the relationship.

          <p>China's shipbuilding industry is rapidly expanding, with its capacity significantly outpacing that of the United States, leading to the world's largest navy by vessel count. While the U.S. fleet retains advantages in overall tonnage and aircraft carriers, China is quickly catching up, fueled by massive investment and a 'military-civilian fusion' strategy. Satellite imagery indicates significant expansion of naval bases, including new piers for nuclear missile submarines. This naval buildup is driven by President Xi Jinping's vision of national resurgence and a vow to prevent future 'humiliations,' posing a growing challenge to U.S. influence in the Pacific and raising concerns among regional allies.</p>
