        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is updating its relationships, sex, and health education guidance for schools in England. The new curriculum will teach pupils to recognize misogyny, the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes, and unhealthy online attitudes, such as those promoted by "incel" culture. It aims to help students identify positive male role models and will also include age-appropriate discussions on suicide prevention. This revised guidance, which replaces a five-year-old framework, will be implemented this autumn and become legally mandatory by September 2026.</p>

          <p>Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed to have intercepted at least 55 Ukrainian drones overnight across several southern and southwestern regions, causing some injuries and damage. This military action occurs as diplomatic tensions escalate, with the U.S. threatening new tariffs against Russia and planning further arms shipments to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing to strengthen bilateral ties ahead of an upcoming summit. European Union foreign ministers are also convening to discuss increased support for Kyiv and stronger sanctions on Moscow.</p>

          <p>The availability of Ireland wing Mack Hansen for the British and Irish Lions' first Test match against Australia is in question due to a foot injury. Conflicting statements from the Lions' coaching staff have created confusion, with one assistant coach initially indicating Hansen was fine while another later admitted he is a doubt. Hansen did not fully participate in Tuesday's training, a key indicator of availability for the upcoming match in Brisbane. The situation is further complicated by suggestions that the 23-man squad may have already been finalized, raising questions about whether he could play even if fit.</p>

Trump remarked that he trusts almost no one and expressed frustration that promising conversations with Putin are often followed by intensified Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities.

The £650 million program aims to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales by making zero-emission vehicles more affordable. While the initiative is welcomed by some automakers, critics and industry figures highlight the urgent need for more public charging infrastructure, as 40% of UK households lack driveways for home charging.

This discovery triggered the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation, yet nearly eight years later, no cases have gone to trial and families have not been permitted to view the footage.

          <p>Chinese commercial space company Space Pioneer has successfully completed a critical ground-based stress test for its Tianlong-3 rocket. The test simulated key mission phases for the rocket's nine-engine first stage, which held up under all conditions. This milestone is significant as it comes a year after a previous static-fire test in June 2024 ended in an explosive mishap, where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed nearby. The company stated that the rocket's tail section must endure enormous stress, and this successful test marks a major step toward ensuring its structural integrity for future flights.</p>

          <p>The historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a nearly century-old landmark on the park's remote North Rim, has been destroyed by a wildfire. The lodge, known for its rustic architecture that blended into the landscape, was a beloved destination for visitors seeking tranquility and spectacular views. The lightning-caused fire, which had been managed for ecological benefit, shifted with the wind and rapidly consumed the structure and dozens of others, forcing hundreds to evacuate. This is the second time the lodge has been destroyed by fire, with the first occurring in 1932, leading to hopes that it will be rebuilt.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced a massive investment of hundreds of billions of dollars to build enormous AI data centers across the United States. This initiative is part of the company's push to develop "superintelligence," which it defines as technology that could surpass human intellect. The first multi-gigawatt facility, named Prometheus, is slated to be online in 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg noted that one of the data center clusters would cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, highlighting the immense scale and energy requirements of the project.</p>

Key recommendations include the NHS holding a summit to tackle the issue, incorporating antisemitism into all diversity training, and creating a standardized qualification for antisemitism trainers.

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its responsibility in the 2019 death of a woman who was struck by a Model S sedan allegedly operating on Autopilot. The victim was stargazing when the car, reportedly traveling at nearly 70mph, collided with her. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the Autopilot driver assistance feature failed to provide adequate warnings or apply the brakes. Tesla contends the driver is solely to blame, claiming he was distracted by a dropped cell phone, making the case a crucial test of shared responsibility between automated systems and human operators.</p>

          <p>Analysts in both the U.S. and China express doubt that Washington can secure explicit public commitments from key allies Japan and Australia regarding their potential actions in a conflict over Taiwan. According to this analysis, the U.S. effort to pressure its allies and amplify the "China threat" narrative may actually signal weakening confidence in its own ability to manage regional tensions. While a former Pentagon official has urged allies to increase defense spending for collective security, experts believe Japan and Australia are unlikely to make such a sensitive public pledge, preferring strategic ambiguity.</p>

The Commerce Department stated the move was necessary to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap Mexican imports that have decimated the domestic industry. While supported by Florida tomato growers, the move is criticized by others who warn it could raise consumer prices for products like salsa and harm U.S. businesses reliant on the imports.

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants. In a controlled experiment, female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. This suggests the moths could perceive the plants as unhealthy hosts for their larvae. The discovery, which builds on the team's previous finding that stressed plants "scream" at frequencies beyond human hearing, opens up a new field of study into a potentially vast and unexplored acoustic ecosystem between plants and animals.</p>

The claimants contend the new price calculation methods will cause them significant financial losses and, for the charities involved, impact their community giving.
