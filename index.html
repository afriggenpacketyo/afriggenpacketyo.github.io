          <p>The White House indicated that President Trump is likely to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, potentially addressing trade tensions between the two nations. This follows accusations from Trump that China violated a previous trade deal negotiated in Geneva, claims which Beijing refuted by accusing the U.S. of provoking economic frictions. The potential dialogue aims to address ongoing disputes over tariffs and trade agreements, which have been a source of market volatility. White House officials have not provided a specific date for the call, but expectations of the discussion helped the market recover from earlier losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexican citizens cast ballots in the nation’s first-ever judicial elections, a controversial vote championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum as a democratic reform. Critics argue the elections will consolidate power within the ruling Morena party and increase vulnerability to corruption. Voters chose from thousands of candidates, with many relying on cheat sheets indicating preferred candidates, but turnout was expected to be lower than in last year’s national balloting.</p>

          <p>US manufacturers are reporting that President Trump’s trade war is negatively impacting production, contributing to a weakening dollar. The ISM survey indicated a decline in manufacturing output, with companies citing uncertainty due to tariffs. The dollar dipped against sterling following the report, and concerns about the economic impact of Trump’s trade policies have intensified. The status of Trump’s tariffs remains unclear after a US court ruled that he overstepped his powers in imposing them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Appeals Ruling Against Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 13:33:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a second ruling that blocks its tariffs, arguing that the court decisions "disrupt sensitive, ongoing negotiations with virtually every trading partner." A federal judge ruled that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs "to reorder the global economy." The administration claims that the ruling undermines the president's authority and threatens ongoing trade negotiations, and lawyers argue that legal disputes over trade policy belong in the Court of International Trade.
