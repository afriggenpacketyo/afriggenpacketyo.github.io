          <p>Former President Trump is reportedly pushing for a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea that includes defense cost-sharing, a move that could strain U.S. credibility with allies. Trump's approach involves bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense payments into a single agreement. While South Korean officials have expressed openness to discussing defense cost-sharing, analysts caution that such a transactional approach could damage long-term U.S. relationships. One potential solution involves South Korea increasing its investment in its own military and purchasing more U.S. military equipment, allowing U.S. forces to focus on broader regional security concerns. </p>

Factors such as the Trump administration's shift towards isolationism have strengthened the case for closer cooperation between the UK and EU.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moodyâ€™s, combined with growing worries about government debt, is causing turbulence in financial markets. The downgrade was influenced by concerns over the fiscal deficit and rising debt costs, exacerbated by a bill in Congress that would make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. This has led to declines in stock futures and weakening of the U.S. dollar, while safe-haven assets like gold have seen an increase. Analysts suggest that this downgrade could highlight fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries, and potentially trigger a demand for higher premiums on U.S. debt. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, China may be surpassing the United States in economic and technological dominance due to its long-term investments in key industries. While the U.S. administration focuses on tariffs and short-term trade skirmishes, China is making significant strides in sectors like AI, electric vehicles, and robotics. China's strategic approach includes massive investments in research and development, while the U.S. faces cuts in research funding and a potential loss of talent. If current trends continue, China is expected to dominate high-end manufacturing, while the U.S. risks becoming a diminished nation reliant on domestic consumption. </p>

With a maximum range of 7,000km and altitude of 15,000 metres, the jet-powered drone can release up to 100 units of loitering ammunition or small drones, including kamikaze UAVs, from its belly. The first mission flight will mark the beginning of a series of tests before the aircraft is deployed by the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA). </p>
