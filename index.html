          <p>Gold prices have surged to new highs, reaching $3,500 per ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil and waning confidence in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. Analysts attribute this trend to President Trump's trade policies, which have diminished the appeal of traditional safe assets. The traditionally inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, with gold's inflation-hedging qualities making it particularly attractive. Experts suggest that dwindling faith in America and its economic policies has further boosted gold's appeal as a stable and independent asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is updating its scientific journal ranking system, suggesting an effort to reshape the global scientific publishing landscape and showcase its growing scientific soft power. The National Science Library under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) released an updated Journal Ranking Table in March, covering around 22,000 journals across 21 major disciplines. Some established international top-tier journals were downgraded, while domestic Chinese journals displayed improvements, with some advancing to higher rankings. This ranking is a critical component of China’s research evaluation system, influencing researcher output assessment, promotions, and doctoral student graduation.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, adding his name to the list of South Korean presidents whose careers have been marred by scandal. The charges relate to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors argue that his former son-in-law, had little experience in the aviation industry but was hired in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency. Moon's Democratic Party has condemned the prosection, calling it a "politically motivated move aimed at humiliating a former president".</p>

This strategy aims to reassure allies in the Indo-Pacific region of continued U.S. commitment to their security.
