            <p>OpenAI has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, accusing him of launching an "unlawful campaign of harassment" against the company. The lawsuit claims Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and X, has used various means to harm OpenAI, including press attacks and a sham takeover bid. OpenAI alleges that Musk's actions stem from his inability to tolerate the success of OpenAI after he abandoned the project. The company is seeking punitive damages and an injunction to prevent Musk from further interfering with its operations.</p>

            <p>President Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate Kirstjen Nielsen and Christopher Krebs, former officials who became critical of his administration. Miles Taylor, targeted for his anonymous op-ed and book, is accused of "treason" by Trump. Krebs, who corrected claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, was fired and later called for Trump's conviction after the January 6th attack.

            <p>China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-on-year in March, signaling continued deflationary pressures. Producer prices also saw a larger-than-expected decline, falling 2.5% year-on-year, marking the 29th consecutive month of deflation. This data comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, with the U.S. increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. China has retaliated with an 84% tariff on U.S. goods. To counter deflationary pressure, Chinese policymakers are focusing on boosting domestic consumption, including subsidies for consumer trade-in programs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is advocating for a levy on streaming services' subscription revenue to fund British high-end TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee suggests streaming companies pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund. This proposal aims to support independent British producers and safeguard the creation of distinctly British content. Streaming services, however, argue that a levy could diminish investment and raise costs for consumers. The call for support comes amid concerns about a decline in domestic high-end TV productions in the UK.</p>

            <h2>Trump's Trade Strategy: Hitting China While Pausing Tariffs Elsewhere</h2>

            <p>President Trump has paused tariffs on most nations for 90 days, but has sharply increased tariffs on China. The move is seen as a shift towards focusing on the trade relationship with China. The aim is to disrupt the established system of global trade centered on China and its export-driven economic model. China's response and willingness to make concessions remain uncertain. The US's commitment to free trade is also questioned.</p>
