            <p>The U.S. and Iran will hold a third round of nuclear talks in Muscat, Oman, following discussions in Italy, with Omani intermediaries facilitating. While a senior administration official claimed "very good progress," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed cautious optimism, noting the need for expert-level discussions to finalize details. Experts highlight the urgency of the situation, emphasizing Iran's increased capacity to produce weapons-grade uranium and deliver it via ballistic missiles compared to 2015 when the original JCPOA was made. The new negotiations aim to address these evolved capabilities, though details on how this round will differ from the original JCPOA remain unclear.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed reports that he shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in a second Signal group chat that included his wife and brother.

            <p>China's commerce ministry has warned against trade deals that harm its interests, stating it will take "corresponding countermeasures" if agreements are struck at China's expense. This comes as the Trump administration negotiates trade deals with other countries, reportedly aiming to isolate China. Trump has also expressed a desire to reach a deal with Beijing, recently raising tariffs on Chinese imports, to which China responded in kind. The Chinese ministry emphasized that seeking tariff exemptions by harming others will ultimately hurt everyone involved.</p>

This attack comes amid reports that Trump is exploring legal options to potentially fire Powell before his term expires in May 2026, a move that analysts warn could trigger significant market turmoil.</p>

            <p>California residents can now purchase naloxone, the generic version of Narcan used to treat opioid overdoses, for $24 through the state's CalRx program. Governor Gavin Newsom stated that this initiative aims to make life-saving medications affordable and accessible to all Californians, expanding a program that previously offered naloxone for free to eligible organizations. Preliminary data suggests a decrease in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in California, potentially influenced by comprehensive efforts to address the opioid crisis. Newsom's plan includes placing naloxone in schools and potentially requiring workplaces to stock it in first aid kits by 2028.</p>

The experience has underscored the importance of identifying and nurturing children's unique strengths, fostering teamwork, and creating a supportive environment, while also recognizing the need to detach personal expectations from their aspirations.

            <p>Chinese enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, driven by concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets, according to a survey by Renmin University’s International Monetary Institute. Economists suggest that the weakening dominance of the US dollar, partly due to new US policies, is creating opportunities for the yuan's internationalization. The survey indicates a rise in enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements, with about 68% using the currency for cross-border trade settlements. Recent volatility in the US Treasury market has further fueled this trend, with global capital not flowing to the US as it has in the past.</p>

Acutis, who died of leukemia at 15, was known for his computer skills and creation of an online database of Eucharistic miracles.
