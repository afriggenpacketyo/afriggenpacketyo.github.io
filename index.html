          <h2>Supreme Court Appears Divided Over Oklahoma Religious Charter School Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 21:00:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's efforts to establish an online Catholic charter school, a case with potential implications for the separation of church and state. Justices appeared split, with some concerned about the flow of public funds to religious institutions and others arguing against discrimination based on religion. The outcome may hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts, and a deadlock would uphold the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against the school. The decision could impact charter school programs nationwide, especially concerning religious curriculum and activities within the schools, so the court's decision is very important to the future of charter schools and religion.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist, was released from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after being detained during an American citizenship interview. A Vermont District Judge ordered his release on bail pending a ruling on a habeas petition challenging his detention. Mahdawi's lawyers argued that his arrest was retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians, and several politicians, including Senator Bernie Sanders, spoke out in support of his release. Mahdawi thanked supporters and expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people, so this is a good sign for Mahdawi and his supporters. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Apple violated a previous court order by charging commissions on purchases made outside its App Store.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the ruling as a victory for developers, and the ruling could significantly impact Apple's App Store revenue, so this is an important case for Apple and Epic Games.

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords.

Tenant advocates argue the increases will harm lower-income residents, while landlords claim the adjustments are insufficient.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. The GDP shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, marking the worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Economists caution that the report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, but they are concerned about the potential disruption from Trump's tariffs. Optimism Score: 30</p>
