          <h2>Poll Reveals Patriotism as Primary Motivator for Americans Flying the Flag</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that most Americans who display the U.S. flag do so out of patriotism and support for the military, rather than for political or fashion statements. While most people do not perceive a clear ideological message from a displayed flag, those who do are more likely to assume the person is conservative. The survey also found that Republicans are more inclined than Democrats to fly the flag to express patriotism or make a political point. A majority of Americans also believe it should be illegal to burn the flag as a form of protest.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman who has lived in the U.S. since childhood, has been released after nearly five months in ICE custody. She was arrested in February while returning from her honeymoon, despite having a pending green card application and being married to a U.S. citizen. Her legal team stated that ICE attempted to deport her twice, actions they condemned as unconstitutional and cruel. Sakeik's case drew significant public and legal pressure, highlighting broader criticisms of the current administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two injured. The blasts, which began Tuesday evening, sparked multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres and continued to trigger smaller detonations. The company was found to be operating without the necessary local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property. While the business has issued a statement of condolence, families are anxiously awaiting news of their missing loved ones as authorities, including the ATF, begin their investigation.</p>

          <p>Two new private universities in China, founded by prominent tycoons, are set to welcome their first undergraduate classes this summer, signaling a new trend in philanthropic educational endeavors. Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, are focused on research and aim to bolster China's goal of scientific self-reliance. Observers anticipate these institutions will become highly selective and may soon compete with top public universities, attracting significant attention from students and parents across the nation.</p>

          <p>After being convicted on two lesser charges but acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking counts, Sean "Diddy" Combs faces a complex future. While the verdict was seen as a partial victory, he still faces significant prison time and his reputation is severely damaged by revelations of violent and drug-fueled sexual encounters. Cultural commentators are divided on whether a comeback is possible for the hip-hop mogul, who was a transformative figure in the music industry. Some believe his tarnished image is irreparable, while others note that fan support remains and that other artists have successfully continued their careers after criminal convictions.</p>

          <p>A massive tax and spending bill, set to be signed into law, represents the culmination of decades of Republican efforts to lower taxes and restrict access to social safety net programs. The legislation extends tax cuts from the first Trump term and adds new deductions, but its most significant impact comes from fundamentally altering Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). By imposing stricter work requirements and cutting funding, the changes are projected to cause millions to lose their benefits. Critics warn of widespread negative effects on low-income families and local economies, while proponents argue it will reduce dependency and fraud.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Valadao of California is facing intense criticism after voting for a major legislative bill that is expected to significantly cut Medicaid funding. This is particularly contentious as roughly two-thirds of his Central Valley constituents rely on the program, known as Medi-Cal. Despite previously vowing to oppose harmful healthcare cuts, Valadao supported the bill, citing negotiated concessions for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have seized on the vote, labeling it a betrayal of his district and vowing to use it to unseat him in the highly competitive 2026 election.</p>

          <p>The impacts of the sweeping new Republican tax and spending bill will be staggered, with many key changes not taking effect until after the 2026 midterm elections. New work requirements for Medicaid recipients are delayed until 2026, while changes to food assistance programs (SNAP) begin this year. On the tax side, new deductions for tips and overtime will be reflected in 2026 tax filings, but the increased SALT deduction cap resets in 2030. Tax credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades are set to be eliminated much sooner, at the end of this year.</p>

          <p>A Hollywood Reporter article alleges that Pixar's latest film, “Elio,” underwent significant changes that stripped its queer and Latinx representation following negative feedback from test audiences and executives. The original director, Adrian Molina, who is gay, reportedly exited the project after his vision was altered, which included removing a scene with a male crush and making the protagonist more "masculine." Actor America Ferrera also left, citing a lack of Latinx leadership. Former staffers expressed sadness over the changes, stating the final version of the film was a generic and inferior product that led to an exodus of talent.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has proposed that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap out the hidden debts of local governments. Researchers at Tsinghua University's ACCEPT argue this measure is crucial for revitalizing economic growth and mitigating systemic financial risks. The proposal suggests that a comprehensive fiscal package, including additional bonds to support the property market and boost consumption, is needed to resolve the interconnected crises of local debt and real estate. The report warns that while the economy shows signs of stabilizing, significant underlying risks remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed a lawsuit against the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, arguing that its plan to add a "truth-telling" exhibit breaks state law.

The lawsuit also contests the relocation of Confederate flags, claiming these changes violate a state law that protects the monument. This legal challenge comes after the park's board approved the changes in 2021 amid a national reckoning over racial injustice and Confederate symbols.</p>

          <p>In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the administration to deport eight noncitizens, currently held at a military base in Djibouti, to South Sudan. This ruling comes despite the fact that nearly all of the men have no ties to the war-torn country and could face danger upon arrival. The decision follows a previous order that paused a lower court's requirement for due process checks before deporting migrants to third countries. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority, stating the order allows the government to bypass rules and send the men to a place where they could face torture or death.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues for a new approach to make popular anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic affordable through employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons between drug makers and pharmacy benefit managers. Instead, employers could directly access the drugs at the lower, direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month and then offer cost-sharing plans to employees. This simplified, transparent model could significantly improve access to these transformative medications for millions of Americans struggling with obesity and related cardiometabolic diseases.</p>

However, the benefit phases out for individuals earning over $150,000 a year to prevent misuse by high earners. The law, which was a key campaign promise for President Trump, is set to expire at the end of 2028 unless extended by Congress. This policy will primarily benefit middle-income tipped workers.

The trade is linked to international crime gangs, people trafficking, and the employment of illegal workers. Experts and law enforcement officials say they are losing the war against this trade due to a lack of resources, low penalties, and the complexity of the criminal networks involved.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's landmark tax and spending bill was achieved through intense political pressure, late-night deal-making, and direct intervention from the president himself. Despite initial resistance from both moderate and fiscally conservative Republicans concerned about Medicaid cuts and the deficit, GOP leadership managed to secure the votes. The process involved adding targeted benefits for specific states to win over senators like Lisa Murkowski and a seven-hour-long procedural vote in the House to wrangle holdouts. This legislative victory underscores Trump's commanding influence over the Republican party and its ability to unify on major policy goals.</p>
