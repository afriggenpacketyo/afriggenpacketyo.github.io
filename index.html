        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks targeting a significant vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint software, a tool widely used by businesses and governments for collaboration. Security researchers indicate the breach could affect thousands of organizations globally, allowing unauthorized actors to access sensitive data and establish persistent backdoors. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has emphasized the serious risk this poses, as it can lead to data theft and password harvesting from connected services like Outlook and Teams. Microsoft has released patches to address the flaw, urging customers with on-premises servers to apply them immediately.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was previously wrongfully deported by the U.S. government and later returned, have asked a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody. The request for a 30-day pause is intended to give them time to address likely efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to detain and deport him again immediately upon release. Abrego Garcia is currently awaiting trial on human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. This complex legal situation highlights the clash between the criminal justice system and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A small non-profit in Connecticut is working to improve the health of the Long Island Sound by recycling used oyster shells from local restaurants. The organization collects thousands of pounds of shells, allows them to cure for a year to eliminate contaminants, and then returns them to the water. These old shells provide an ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, helping to rebuild critical oyster beds. This restoration is vital as oysters filter water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for hundreds of other marine species, contributing to a healthier ocean ecosystem.</p>

He revealed that he and Warner maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show concluded, with Warner calling him regularly.

The DMV is seeking to suspend Tesla's dealer license for at least 30 days and to secure financial restitution for customers.

          <p>Timekeepers and scientists are observing that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter by milliseconds. This trend, if it continues, could force the unprecedented step of introducing a "negative leap second"—removing a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with the planet's rotation. While daily life is unaffected, this change poses a challenge for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping. Interestingly, scientists note that the melting of polar ice due to global warming is creating a drag effect that is slightly counteracting and slowing this acceleration.</p>

          <p>The head of Sport England has formally expressed deep concern to the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, regarding a recent wave of online racist and sexist abuse directed at the Lionesses, England's women's football team. The letter warns that this "toxic culture" threatens to undermine significant progress and investment aimed at increasing female participation in sports. This action follows public revelations from players, like defender Jess Carter, about being targeted with racist abuse throughout the recent tournament. The incident has intensified calls for social media companies to be held more accountable under the UK's Online Safety Act.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Plan to 'Flood' Sanctuary Cities with ICE Agents</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has declared that the administration will now prioritize and intensify immigration enforcement in so-called "sanctuary cities." Homan vowed to "flood the zone" with ICE agents to overcome the lack of cooperation from local governments in these municipalities. The hardline announcement came after an off-duty law enforcement officer was shot in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. This signals a new, more confrontational phase in the administration's mass deportation drive, directly targeting cities with policies that limit collaboration with federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to use military installations in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, following approval from the Pentagon. The plan also includes increasing the number of migrants detained at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is a response to the Trump administration's push to detain more people amid a shortage of space in existing immigration facilities. The use of military bases for this purpose has been condemned by some lawmakers as an inappropriate use of defense resources that jeopardizes military preparedness.</p>

This reveals a significant disconnect between headline economic data and the day-to-day experiences of households and businesses.

          <p>The judge assigned to Donald Trump's $10 billion libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal is Darrin Gayles, the same federal judge who presided over a previous case Trump filed against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. In that earlier case, Trump voluntarily withdrew his lawsuit shortly after Judge Gayles scheduled a deposition where Trump would have had to testify under oath. The assignment of the same judge raises the possibility of a similar scenario, where Trump may have to choose between facing questions under oath or dropping his high-profile lawsuit.</p>

He believes the government is making an example of him to deter others from monitoring ICE activities. Guevara's lawyer notes that he has a valid work permit and a pathway to citizenship, making his prolonged detention particularly concerning for press freedom advocates.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Donald Trump's recently signed tax bill is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, resulting in an estimated $4.5 trillion in lost revenue. Proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs, estimated to save $1.1 trillion, will only partially offset the cost and are projected to leave 10 million more Americans without health insurance.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have faced off in a Boston courtroom over the government's decision to freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding for the university. The administration claims the move is necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, but the presiding judge expressed skepticism, calling the government's reasoning "mind-boggling." The judge questioned how cutting funds for medical and scientific research would address the issue of anti-Jewish bias. The case represents a major battle over academic freedom, federal oversight, and the administration's use of financial leverage.</p>

A major sticking point is revenue sharing, as WNBA players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, compared to the roughly 50% split in the NBA. Amid record growth in viewership and investment, the players are publicly demanding a larger and fairer share of the business they help create.</p>
