          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to End TPS for Venezuelans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 19:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the termination of TPS, potentially leading to the loss of work permits and deportation protections for these individuals. The administration argued that continuing the program was "contrary to the national interest," while TPS beneficiaries contended that ending it would cause significant harm, forcing them to return to a dangerous country. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The optimism score reflects the disruption and uncertainty caused by this policy change.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer has been sentenced to life in prison for the second time for the murder of her husband nearly 20 years ago, after a jury again found her responsible for his death. Stermer was accused of setting her husband on fire and running him over with a van in 2007. She was initially convicted in 2010, but won an appeal for a new trial, which she also lost. The judge emphasized the gruesome nature of the crime, stating that she could not fathom the suffering he endured in his last moments of life, but Stermer maintained her innocence.</p>

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential deficit-increasing fiscal plans, has intensified the debate among Republicans over tax and spending cuts. Fiscally conservative Republicans are leveraging the downgrade to demand deeper cuts to federal programs, while Republican leaders face pressure from moderates concerned about the political fallout of slashing social programs. The Republican plan, as it stands, would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain calm and not panic in response to Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to similar downgrades in 2011 and 2023. He argued that the downgrade prompted more fear than warranted by the short-term economic environment, and suggested that investors use the situation as an opportunity to invest more, rather than sell off their portfolios. Cramer also cautioned against being swayed by fear-mongering, noting that those spreading fear may have ulterior motives. He suggested gold and bitcoin as hedges against government borrowing, if investors are seeking to act on their downgrade-prompted fear (not investment advice).</p>
