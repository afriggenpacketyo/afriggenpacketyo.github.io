          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a stronger-than-expected first quarter, driven by robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant's revenue increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching 79.1 trillion Korean won, while operating profit rose by 1.5% to 6.7 trillion Korean won, marginally exceeding forecasts. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties related to trade tensions and global growth slowdown, Samsung anticipates improved performance in the second half of the year, contingent on diminished uncertainties. The company is a leading manufacturer of memory chips and the world's second-largest smartphone maker.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to disburse $12 million in congressionally approved grant money to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a news organization providing independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. Judge Royce C. Lamberth criticized the administration's delay tactics and defended the judiciary's nonpartisan nature amidst accusations of political agendas. The ruling follows previous orders to restore operations at Voice of America and halt efforts to shut down other federally funded newsrooms, underscoring the court's commitment to upholding congressional mandates and journalistic integrity. RFE/RL had been on the brink of collapse after the Trump administration terminated its grant and withheld funds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders easing some tariffs on automakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors, and others said would backfire on U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of their imported components, phased out over two years. While automakers welcomed the flexibility, a 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, and General Motors abandoned its forecast for solid profit growth this year due to the uncertainty.</p>

The county plans to fund the settlement through bonds and its rainy day fund, impacting future investments in community services. The settlement arose from Assembly Bill 218, which extended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse lawsuits, leading to a surge of litigation against the county.</p>

Turkey's military expansion, including building at least 136 military installations since 2018, has given it de facto control over Iraqi land. This expansion has led to displacement, deforestation, and restricted access to land for villagers.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advised parents to "do your own research" before vaccinating their infants during a televised interview with Dr. Phil, making false statements that cast doubt on the benefits of vaccination and the independence of the FDA. Kennedy suggested the measles shot was unsafe and contradicted decades of advice from public health experts. Vaccine experts criticized Kennedy's comments, noting that his views promote misinformation and could harm public health. These comments come amidst a significant measles outbreak in the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the U.S. Border Patrol to halt illegal stops and warrantless arrests in California's Central Valley, following reports of agents detaining farm workers and laborers without reasonable suspicion. The ruling comes after a raid in Bakersfield sparked outrage, with agents allegedly slashing the tires of a U.S. citizen on his way to work. The judge's order allows the ACLU to bring a class action lawsuit against the government and requires the Border Patrol to submit detailed documentation of any stops or warrantless arrests in the area.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal more than twice as slowly as those of other mammals, likely due to an evolutionary trade-off where we lost fur in favor of sweat glands for cooling. Researchers compared healing rates in humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice, finding that humans regrew skin at about a quarter of a millimeter per day, while the other animals regrew skin at about 0.62 millimeters of new skin per day. The presence of hair follicles in furry animals accelerates healing through stem cells, a feature less prominent in human skin.</p>
