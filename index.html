          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to significantly disrupt the mortgage market for most homebuyers, according to housing experts. While conventional loans from private lenders should proceed normally, applicants for government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA may experience minor processing delays. Another potential issue could be securing flood insurance through the FEMA-administered program, which cannot issue new policies during a shutdown, possibly affecting closings in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>The United States has experienced 14 government shutdowns since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required federal agencies to cease operations during funding gaps. These events, often stemming from partisan disputes over budgets and policy, have varied in length from a single day to the record 34-day shutdown in 2018-2019. Historically, conflicts have arisen over issues like spending cuts under President Reagan, budget balancing with President Clinton, and healthcare and immigration under Presidents Obama and Trump, highlighting their increasing use as a political tool.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress and the president continue to receive their salaries, while hundreds of thousands of federal workers are furloughed or work without immediate pay. This disparity is due to constitutional provisions and laws that establish permanent funding for lawmaker and presidential compensation, which does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal agency employees, including many congressional staffers, face delayed paychecks until new funding is approved, though a 2019 law now guarantees them back pay.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation, forcing federal agencies to halt all non-essential functions. Essential services, such as national security and air traffic control, continue operating, but employees in these roles work without immediate pay. Programs with permanent funding like Social Security and Medicare are unaffected, but new applications or customer service may see delays. Past shutdowns have cost taxpayers billions in lost productivity and back pay for furloughed workers, with the most recent one in 2018-2019 causing an estimated $3 billion permanent economic loss.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated he could use the Insurrection Act to deploy the military to combat violent crime in Chicago, urging Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to "beg for help." The 1807 law grants the president authority to use active-duty military for domestic law enforcement under specific circumstances. Trump's comments intensify his ongoing criticism of crime management in Democrat-led cities, asserting that such an action would be within his legal rights and pointing to past presidents who have invoked the act.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is set to lose its quorum for the fourth time, rendering it unable to enforce campaign finance laws as the nation heads into another multi-billion dollar election cycle. With a commissioner's recent departure, the agency will have only two of the six positions filled, short of the four required to conduct official business like investigations or issuing guidance. Former FEC chair Ellen Weintraub warns that this gutting of the agency, primarily occurring under the Trump administration, removes the "cop on the beat" for money in politics and emboldens illegal behavior.</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, Republican candidate and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa is resisting pressure to drop out, a move that could consolidate votes for independent Andrew Cuomo against front-runner Zohran Mamdani. Despite polling in third place, Sliwa's presence is seen as splitting the anti-Mamdani vote. Sliwa has rejected calls to quit from prominent figures, including Donald Trump and billionaire donors, and has even alleged that he was offered bribes to exit the race, vowing to stay in and let voters decide the outcome.</p>

          <p>The global shipping industry is bracing for disruption as the U.S. and China impose retaliatory port fees on each other's vessels, escalating their trade conflict. China's policy targets ships that are U.S.-built, flagged, or have significant U.S. ownership, a rule that could affect a substantial portion of the global fleet, including third-country vessels. Analysts predict this will primarily impact tankers and dry bulk carriers importing energy and grain into China, while the U.S. fees are expected to affect container shipping, adding volatility to shipping rates.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that the UK will have the second-fastest growing economy among the G7 nations this year, with growth forecast at 1.3%.

Research shows that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authenticity, and helping others, whereas employers are primarily looking for candidates who value achievement, learning, and hard work. This disconnect means only 2% of Gen Z job seekers share the top priorities of their potential bosses. The article advises young workers to be honest about their financial goals to decide whether they should adapt to employer expectations or seek careers that align more closely with their personal values.</p>

This action represents a significant escalation, targeting active politicians from Mexico's ruling party and others, which is a diplomatically sensitive move. While the U.S. is not required to provide a reason for visa revocations, the move is seen as a way to exert pressure on Mexico to increase cooperation on security and anti-narcotics operations, though it risks straining bilateral relations.</p>
