          <p>This article outlines the timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration claimed Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, which his family denies, leading to his deportation to a mega-prison. Following court battles, the Supreme Court ruled that the government should facilitate his return, though the Trump administration interpreted the ruling narrowly. Abrego Garcia was eventually brought back to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges. His case has raised questions about due process and the rights of immigrants. Optimism is low given the serious charges and the potential for deportation following any prison sentence. </p>

          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes features a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, with Journalism, Sovereignty, and Baeza competing among eight horses. Journalism, winner of the Preakness, is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont, which will be held at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park. Sovereignty, who won the Derby, skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, while Baeza looks to improve on his third-place Derby finish. The Belmont's distance is shortened to 1 1/4 miles this year, matching the Derby's length.

          <p>Jonathan Turley discusses the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, not for a removal hearing, but for a trial on human trafficking charges that could lead to a lengthy prison sentence and subsequent deportation. Turley argues that Abrego Garcia's notoriety and the attention from Democratic politicians may have backfired, bringing scrutiny to his past conduct, including accusations of domestic violence and gang affiliation. He highlights the details of a 2022 traffic stop where Abrego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking but allowed to leave, raising questions about immigration enforcement. The indictment details extensive human trafficking violations, complicating Abrego Garcia's situation. </p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit. The Delaware program also includes work requirements and financial coaching, helping recipients save money through flat monthly payments and interest-bearing savings accounts. While some argue time limits encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the potential for homelessness, citing experiences in Washington state where time limits were eventually abandoned. The article highlights the importance of additional support, such as savings accounts and assistance with budgeting, to ensure the success of time-limited rental aid programs. </p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is rewriting the liquor industry as their tastes shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town known for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to cater to this new demand. Chinese liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on low-alcohol options. This shift reflects a broader trend of prioritizing self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals in alcohol consumption. </p>

          <p>Ross Douthat explores the evolving political interests of Elon Musk, noting his shift away from Obama-era liberalism and his alignment with the online right. Initially, it was assumed Musk's political involvement was driven by cultural concerns and a desire to advance space exploration, leading to expectations of him serving as a technologist and anti-woke figure in a second Trump administration. However, Musk's actual role has been less defined, with his influence on deregulatory efforts and anti-woke initiatives remaining unclear. Douthat questions the motivations behind Musk's political actions and his ultimate goals within the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump has fostered a culture of corruption, where individuals who enrich him and his family receive favorable treatment from the government. The editorial points to the cryptocurrency industry as a prime example, noting Trump's financial gains from cryptocurrency sales and his subsequent policy changes that benefited the industry. Despite previous skepticism, Trump's administration has dropped investigations, pardoned executives, and nullified tax rules related to cryptocurrency. The editorial contends that this self-enrichment weakens American democracy and undermines public trust in government. </p>

While critics express concerns about the cost and potential for intimidation, the author argues that the parade could serve as a patriotic celebration and counter misperceptions about the armed forces. The parade could also help address the military's shrinking recruitment numbers and reconnect veterans with the country. The author acknowledges the risk that Trump may use the event for political purposes but emphasizes the importance of honoring the men and women who defend the United States. </p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's investigation into Joe Biden's cognitive decline is an abuse of power enabled by the Supreme Court's decision granting presidents immunity for "official" acts. The author suggests that Trump's actions may be aimed at expanding presidential immunity to protect not only the president but also his aides. By targeting Biden's aides, Trump could potentially set a precedent that shields his own administration from future criminal activity. The author warns against defending against the investigation on procedural immunity grounds, advocating instead for a defense on the merits. </p>
