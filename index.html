          <p>A cafe owner in Canada, Leighton Walters, lauded Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for his support after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) initially ordered him to stop selling Vegemite due to vitamin B concerns. Albanese publicly backed Vegemite, contrasting it favorably with Marmite, which prompted the CFIA to pause its decision. The agency is now working with the importer to allow Vegemite sales in the short term with revised labeling, while seeking a long-term solution.

          <p>Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor who studies democratic decline, argues that the Trump administration has already inflicted significant damage on American democracy.

His analysis suggests that the current political climate poses a serious threat to the foundations of American governance and its institutions.

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings report amid investor concerns about tariffs and Elon Musk's relationship with the Trump administration. Analysts anticipate a slight revenue decline, but the focus will be on future prospects, particularly given the stock's 44% drop this year. Tesla previously reported a 13% decrease in deliveries, attributing it to factory upgrades for the Model Y. Musk has attempted to reassure employees about the company's potential in robotics, AI, and autonomous driving, despite facing backlash over his political stances and tariff-related disagreements with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Several corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Apple, Chobani, and Nvidia, have recently unveiled plans to expand their manufacturing operations in the United States. These announcements coincide with the implementation of new tariffs by the Trump administration, although not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary motivation. The White House has highlighted these moves as evidence of Trump's success in fostering job creation domestically. Economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to drive such strategic shifts, noting that labor and energy costs, tax rates, and political stability are more influential factors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's independence, with speculation that Trump may attempt to remove Powell. Analysts suggest that even firing Powell might not guarantee the desired rate cuts, potentially requiring the replacement of the entire Fed Board.

The speculation coincides with ongoing tariff uncertainties, negatively impacting investor confidence in the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company is not seeing signs of an impending U.S. recession, even as President Trump's tariffs weigh on oil demand expectations. Wirth acknowledged that growth may be slowing, but Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to falling oil prices. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its U.S. growth outlook for the year, and OPEC has reduced its demand forecasts. Wirth anticipates a pullback in U.S. onshore oil production if prices hit $60 per barrel, but expects minimal direct impact on Chevron's business from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A paddleboarder was "guided to her death", a court has heard during the sentencing of the tour company owner after the deaths of four people. Paul O'Dwyer, 42, Andrea Powell, 41, Morgan Rogers, 24, and Nicola Wheatley, 40, drowned while paddleboarding in "extremely hazardous conditions" on the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in October 2021. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, 39, from Port Talbot, is the former owner of Salty Dog, the now-dissolved company that operated the tour. Lloyd pleaded guilty to manslaughter last month and it was revealed she did not have the correct qualifications to run the tour.</p>

Bitcoin's correlation with equities has decreased, suggesting it is decoupling from risk assets, and analysts are observing its resilience amidst economic uncertainty (not investment advice).</p>

The proposal comes as violence continues, with Israeli air strikes reportedly killing at least 26 Palestinians.
