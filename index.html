          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 13:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in Medina v. Planned Parenthood, ruled that Medicaid patients cannot sue states under federal civil rights law to enforce their right to choose their healthcare provider. The 6-3 decision effectively allows South Carolina to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood, a move the state initiated in 2018. This ruling significantly alters the enforcement of federal Medicaid law, as it removes a key legal avenue for patients to challenge state-level decisions, potentially impacting access to care for millions of low-income Americans and setting a precedent for other states.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from TransUnion indicates a record 31% of federal student loan borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, signaling a potential "default cliff" as involuntary collections resume. Millions of borrowers are at risk of defaultingâ€”defined as being 270 days past dueâ€”in the coming months, which could lead to wage garnishment and significant damage to their credit scores. The report highlights the financial strain on borrowers following the end of pandemic-era payment pauses, with experts predicting that default rates will continue to climb.

          <p>A disciplinary panel has dismissed two Metropolitan Police officers for gross misconduct related to the 2020 strip-search of a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q. The officers, Kristina Linge and Rafal Szmydynski, conducted the search at the girl's school in Hackney after she was wrongly suspected of possessing cannabis, an act the panel deemed "humiliating" and "degrading." While the panel found the search was improper, it concluded that neither age nor race were proven factors, a finding that contrasts with a previous safeguarding report which suggested racism was likely a factor.</p>

          <p>This article explores debt settlement as a potential solution for individuals overwhelmed by credit card debt, weighing its advantages and disadvantages. The primary benefit is the possibility of paying significantly less than the total amount owed, offering a faster resolution than minimum payments and an alternative to bankruptcy. However, the process carries substantial risks, including severe damage to one's credit score, no guarantee of success with creditors, and potential tax liabilities on the forgiven portion of the debt.

OCT has refuted these claims, stating that it empowers youth who are already concerned about climate change to participate in civic life and that the idea of manufactured "climate anxiety" is insulting to children facing real environmental threats.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recently reconstituted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal. The 5-1 vote marks one of the first major decisions by the new panel, whose membership has been a source of controversy within the public health community. This recommendation diverges from long-standing guidance from health organizations that have deemed the mercury-based preservative safe in the small amounts used in vaccines.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly considering softening proposed welfare cuts to prevent a significant rebellion from his own Labour MPs. With 126 backbenchersâ€”about half of those without a government roleâ€”backing an amendment to block the legislation, the prime minister is personally engaging in talks to find a compromise. The bill aims to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability and sickness benefits, a move the government deems necessary to control spending but which critics argue will harm vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Three-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon of Kenya is attempting to break a major track and field barrier by becoming the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes. The Nike-sponsored exhibition event in Paris will require the 31-year-old to shave more than seven seconds off her own world record. To achieve this "moonshot," Kipyegon will utilize advanced technology, including rotating pacers to reduce air resistance, a custom speed suit, and innovative 3D-printed athletic gear, though the result will not be officially recorded as a world record.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Data Reveals Significant Delays in Support Plans for Special Needs Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 12:11:38 EDT</div>

          <p>New data from the Department for Education shows that fewer than half of all education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special needs in England were issued within the 20-week legal deadline last year. The number of children requiring these legally binding support plans has risen to a record high, leaving local authorities "overwhelmed." This failure to provide timely support is causing distress for families, who fear their children are missing crucial interventions, while a promised government reform could potentially alter or replace the EHCP system entirely.</p>

          <p>Denis Villeneuve, the acclaimed director of the "Dune" saga and "Blade Runner 2049," has been chosen to direct the next installment of the James Bond franchise. This marks the first major creative decision for the 007 series under Amazon MGM's control. Villeneuve, a self-professed "die-hard Bond fan," expressed his excitement and respect for the character's legacy, stating he intends to honor its tradition. The film is not expected to be released until after Villeneuve completes his third "Dune" movie, and no actor has yet been named to succeed Daniel Craig in the iconic role.</p>
