          <p>A 39-year-old German woman was arrested after a stabbing attack at Hamburg's central train station, leaving several people injured, some critically. Police believe she acted alone and are investigating whether mental illness was a factor, with no immediate indication of a political motive. The attacker targeted people on the platform between tracks 13 and 14, causing the closure of four tracks and delays to long-distance trains. Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his concern, and the incident follows several other stabbing attacks in Germany in recent years, raising concerns about public safety.</p>

Trump claims the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. The president will hold a rally at US Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by First Street projects that climate change-driven extreme weather events could cause a 380% surge in foreclosures across the U.S. over the next 10 years, potentially accounting for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, and lenders could lose billions annually due to mortgage defaults. The study also notes that rising insurance premiums are already shaping foreclosure trends, and integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help mitigate the impact, although it could also tighten lending conditions. Florida, Louisiana, California, and parts of the Northeast are projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America, later widening the threat to any smartphone. The EU has responded that it remains committed to securing a deal, while warning again that it was prepared to retaliate. Analysts suggest Trump's rhetoric is intended to increase leverage ahead of negotiations, but EU politicians have expressed dismay, warning that tariffs would be damaging to both sides. Shares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the latest threats.</p>

          <p>Undergraduate students at Ramapo College of New Jersey have helped identify the skeletal remains of Henry Goodsell, a sea captain who died nearly 200 years ago. Goodsell was the captain of the schooner Oriental, which sank off the coast of New Jersey in 1844. Using investigative genetic genealogy, the students matched DNA from bone fragments found on South Jersey beaches to Goodsell's descendants. This identification is one of the oldest cold cases solved using this method, highlighting the power of modern genealogy testing in resolving historical mysteries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt can have severe consequences, including a significant drop in credit score and potential lawsuits from debt collectors. Default typically occurs after 180 days of missed payments, but credit scores can be affected much sooner. Before defaulting, consider contacting the credit card issuer to explore hardship programs or debt management plans. Defaulted accounts can remain on credit reports for up to seven years, making it harder to obtain loans or rent an apartment. (not investment advice)</p>

Effective methods include installment agreements, offers in compromise, currently not collectible status, and innocent spouse relief. Acting quickly and choosing the right strategy is crucial, and consulting with tax relief professionals can aid in negotiating with the IRS and requesting a garnishment release.

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that the intense criticism directed at Harvard has become excessive, labeling it "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges the university's serious ailments, including erosion of academic freedom and political narrowness, but rejects extreme characterizations of Harvard as a "woke madrasa" or "anti-Semitic institution." Pinker criticizes the Trump administration's punitive actions, such as slashing research funding and threatening tax-exempt status, advocating for a more balanced approach to address the university's issues. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining intellectual diversity and protecting academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves surgery to create a path for fluid drainage. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period, as early diagnosis and treatment can improve prognosis.</p>

While nuclear energy doesn't produce carbon emissions, it generates radioactive waste, raising environmental concerns.
