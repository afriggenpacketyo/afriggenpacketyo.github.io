          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first dust storm warning for the city. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, disrupted travel and graduation ceremonies. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, the event was described as something out of the history books. The incident marks only the second time the Chicago office has issued a dust storm warning.</p>

On Friday, Lindner stepped down as chairman of the pro-business party after leading it to a disastrous result in February's national election, leaving the FDP without a seat in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament. On Friday evening, Christian DÃ¼rr, the party's former parliamentary leader, was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman, receiving 82% of the vote.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that the government's policies favor more state intervention and debt, contrasting with the voters' desire for less state control and more freedom. Christian DÃ¼rr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman. Lindner's departure follows the FDP's poor performance in the national election, where the party failed to secure a seat in the Bundestag.</p>
