          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal to this ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of these tariffs. The court's decision caused major stock markets in Asia to rise and the US dollar to gain against safe-haven currencies, reflecting investor relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand before the potential impact of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs without passing them on to consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year through March due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Canadian province of Manitoba has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to widespread wildfires, necessitating the evacuation of over 17,000 people. Premier Wab Kinew has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in evacuation and firefighting efforts, particularly in remote northern communities. The town of Flin Flon, along with several other remote towns and Indigenous communities, are among those being evacuated, with most evacuees being transported to Winnipeg.

This consideration follows increased pressure on Britain to take a stronger stance against Israel's conduct in the war. However, the recent deadly shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some officials to reconsider the timing of such sanctions. The UK is likely to assess whether Israel allows more aid into Gaza before making a final decision, amidst growing international criticism of Israel's actions.</p>

Although the Slovak government has acknowledged the issue and introduced reforms, these measures often reinforce segregation rather than eliminate it.

          <p>South Korea's central bank has lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% in response to political uncertainty and economic challenges. The decision was influenced by concerns about economic growth and relatively stable inflation. This marks the central bank's fourth rate cut in the last six meetings. The Bank of Korea also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%, considerably lower than the previous projection of 1.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
