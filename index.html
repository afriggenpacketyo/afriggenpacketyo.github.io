          <p>Despite President Trump's criticism, Russia and Ukraine continued cross-border drone attacks, with Ukrainian officials reporting successful air defenses against Russian strikes, including in Kyiv. Zelenskyy stated that Russia's impunity drives these attacks and called for international force to achieve peace. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have downed Ukrainian drones over several regions, while Ukraine reported attacks on facilities within Russia producing strike drones and components for weapons. The ongoing conflict, now in its third year, shows no signs of abating, with both sides engaging in increasingly large bombardments. Trump rebuked Putin and Zelenskyy, expressing frustration and urging an end to the conflict, while Zelenskyy appealed for tougher sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court overturned former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. Kurz, a former rising star among European conservatives, had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. The three-judge panel acquitted Kurz, who resigned as chancellor in 2021, after twice heading a governing coalition in Austria with different parties. Further details surrounding the case and the reasoning behind the acquittal are expected to emerge as the story develops.</p>

          <p>This Memorial Day, it is important to remember that the holiday is a solemn occasion dedicated to honoring American service members who died in military service, not a time for celebration. Unlike Veterans Day, which celebrates all service members, Memorial Day is a day for reflection and reverence for those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Misguided messages that confuse Memorial Day with Veterans Day have drawn criticism, emphasizing the need to choose words that reflect the gravity of the day. To honor Memorial Day, individuals can reflect, attend remembrance ceremonies, or learn about fallen service members, showing proper respect to those who made freedom possible.</p>

          <p>Former Obama budget director Peter Orszag argues that America's fiscal situation has deteriorated significantly, with annual budget deficits running at 6% of GDP and interest rates on 10-year Treasuries more than doubling. He projects that by 2029, the debt as a share of the economy will reach levels unseen since World War II, and the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and focusing on fiscal savings in entitlement programs to manage these risks. He concludes that recognizing the elevated fiscal risks is the first step toward fiscal health and reducing the budget deficit (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article addresses the common misconception about shrimp being unhealthy due to its cholesterol content, explaining that dietary cholesterol has less impact on blood cholesterol levels for most people than saturated and trans fats. Shrimp is low in saturated fat and offers essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and vitamin B12. Eating one or two servings of shrimp per week can fit into a heart-healthy diet, especially when prepared in lighter ways such as grilling or sautÃ©ing with olive oil, rather than frying or drowning in creamy sauces.

The decline threatens to destabilize the U.S. tourism industry, potentially resulting in job losses and reduced spending by international visitors.

          <p>A mother shares a story about a stranger's act of kindness during her autistic son's meltdown in a grocery store, highlighting the importance of empathy over sympathy. When her son, Vedant, became overwhelmed and started pulling her hair, a woman in line offered to help unload her cart and later paid for her groceries. The woman, who also had a child with autism, offered silent support and comfort, providing a sense of healing and understanding. The experience taught the mother that she is not alone and that there are people who understand her struggles, reducing her vulnerability in public situations.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order from President Trump aims to address the issue of homeless veterans in Los Angeles by transforming the VA campus in West Los Angeles into the National Center for Warrior Independence. The order directs the VA secretary to create a plan to house 6,000 veterans on the campus by 2028, using funds previously spent on housing for illegal aliens. While advocates embrace the news, some question the lack of specifics and express concern about the potential for creating a "ghetto" on the campus. Despite the uncertainty, the order has given new hope that long-awaited housing for veterans could finally be coming.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has reversed its position on a rule that would have banned the reporting of medical debt on credit reports, now joining a lawsuit to block the rule. The CFPB, under new leadership appointed by President Trump, argues that Congress should decide whether medical debt can be included on credit reports. Consumer advocates argue that the CFPB's reversal undermines consumer protections and disregards the extensive work and public comments that supported the rule. The legal battle has significant financial implications for millions of Americans whose credit scores are negatively impacted by medical debt.</p>

          <p>Food apps that rate the healthfulness of packaged foods are increasingly popular, but nutrition experts advise using them with skepticism. While apps can help consumers decode nutrition labels and nudge them toward healthier choices, different apps may provide conflicting scores for the same product. Experts recommend opting for apps that assess overall nutrient content rather than focusing solely on individual ingredients, and to consider the amount of an ingredient rather than its mere presence. They also caution against overreacting to app ratings and suggest verifying information with ingredient lists and simple math to assess a food's healthfulness.</p>

Johnson insists the requirements are not burdensome, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week, participate in job training, or volunteer. However, the bill faces opposition in the Senate, with concerns raised about cost-sharing measures and potential loss of coverage for many low-income individuals.</p>

Five BBC pundits, including Fara Williams, accurately predicted the top-four teams, but only one team, Chelsea, was in the correct position in those predictions.
