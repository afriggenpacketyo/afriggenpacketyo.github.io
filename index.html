          <p>At 27, Marissa Coreno was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer after discovering a lump she almost ignored. Her story highlights a concerning rise in breast cancer diagnoses among women under 50, an age group typically not subject to regular screenings. After undergoing exhaustive chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and hormone therapy, Coreno is now cancer-free and uses her experience to advocate for self-awareness. She emphasizes that cancer can affect anyone and urges others to seek medical attention for any unusual symptoms, stressing there is light after a diagnosis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant political gender gap has emerged among Gen Z Americans, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in recent U.S. history. This trend is driven by pressing concerns over reproductive rights, economic inequality, and social justice, leading many to feel that their health and safety are directly at stake. Rejecting moderate labels like 'liberal,' they express disillusionment with both major parties, viewing them as beholden to corporate interests. This ideological shift is also influenced by online algorithms, which may be amplifying polarizing content differently for young men and women.</p>

          <p>Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill is amplifying her New Jersey gubernatorial campaign with support from prominent party figures, including former President Barack Obama and Governors Gretchen Whitmer and Wes Moore. This strategic push comes as polls indicate her lead over Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli is narrowing to just five points. The race is drawing national attention as a potential bellwether for future elections, with both candidates engaging in heated debates that reflect broader national political tensions. The outcome in the blue-leaning but historically competitive state remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to confirm Douglas Troutman, a former chemical industry lobbyist, to head the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. Environmental groups have raised alarms, stating that his appointment would mean the top four positions in the office are held by individuals with industry ties, which they fear will undermine public health protections. Critics point to Troutman's past efforts to repeal a California law requiring the disclosure of chemicals in cleaning products as evidence that he will prioritize corporate interests over consumer safety and environmental regulation.</p>

          <p>North Korea has unveiled what its state media describes as its "most powerful nuclear strategic weapon system," a new missile whose existence was disclosed just last month. The development was highlighted during a military parade attended by high-ranking officials from Russia and Vietnam, suggesting deepening ties with certain nations. This display of military advancement comes as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made his first visit to China since 2019, creating speculation about whether Pyongyang is pressuring Beijing to more openly acknowledge its status as a nuclear power.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Congressman George Santos, who will be released immediately. Santos had been serving a seven-year sentence after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. In his announcement, Trump claimed Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison, a sentiment echoed by Santos's attorney who cited threats against his client's life. The decision, which is a commutation and not a pardon, drew sharp criticism from fellow Republicans who argued Santos's crimes warranted a longer sentence.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs, the economies of the U.S. and China remain deeply intertwined. The U.S. faces a significant trade deficit and relies heavily on China for critical goods like rare-earth minerals, making consumers vulnerable to price hikes from tariffs. In response to U.S. export controls on technology, Beijing has restricted mineral exports and shifted purchases of agricultural products like soybeans to other countries. While China is diversifying its export markets, its reliance on U.S. technology and the presence of Chinese goods in American supply chains underscore a complex, ongoing codependence.

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing to run for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat in 2026, a move that promises a contentious and nationally watched race in San Francisco. This development has intensified the debate over whether the 85-year-old Pelosi will seek another term, reflecting a broader conversation within the Democratic Party about generational change. Wiener's decision seems strategically timed to counter another wealthy progressive challenger, Saikat Chakrabarti, forcing him to start fundraising early for what is expected to be an expensive primary.</p>

          <h2>Native Tribes in Owens Valley Seek Return of Water Rights from Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>Indigenous tribes in California's Owens Valley are escalating their campaign to reclaim water rights from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Tribal leaders argue that decades of extensive groundwater pumping by L.A. have desiccated their ancestral homeland, destroying vital springs, meadows, and the broader ecosystem. While the city maintains its water management is sustainable, the tribes assert that the extraction has stolen a "life force" from their land. They are now seeking the return of both land and water rights to restore their environment and ensure their sovereign viability.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his titles, including the Duke of York, following sustained pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a statement, the prince said the ongoing accusations against him were a distraction from the work of the Royal Family. This decision, made in consultation with the King, means he will no longer use his title or other honours. Although he remains a prince, this move further diminishes his role after he already stepped back from public duties in 2019.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, the election technology firm at the center of 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been sold and rebranded as Liberty Vote. The new owner, Scott Leiendecker, issued a public statement with a conservative tone, promising to restore faith in elections. However, in private communications to county election officials, the company assured them of continuity with the "same team, same support." This dual messaging has sparked questions about whether the acquisition represents a genuine transformation or is merely a strategic rebrand to appeal to a different political demographic.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is creating a stark, daily reminder of its consequences for lawmakers, as the Capitol Police officers who protect them are forced to work without pay.

A temporary 48-hour truce failed to hold, with Pakistan conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika province.

          <p>The Falls of Clyde, a historic iron-hulled sailing ship built in Scotland in 1878, was intentionally sunk off the coast of Hawaii by the Honolulu Harbour Board. The vessel, which had been a museum ship since the 1960s, had fallen into severe disrepair. The decision has sparked outrage from maritime conservation groups in both the UK and the US, who had campaigned for over a decade to have the ship returned to Scotland for restoration. The harbor board proceeded with the scuttling to redevelop the pier where the ship was moored.</p>
