          <p>President Trump stated he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previous criticisms and market anxieties about Powell's job security. Trump, who nominated Powell, has been critical of the Fed's interest rate policies, urging for more aggressive cuts. He also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, hinting at potential tariff reductions if a deal is reached. These remarks led to positive market reactions, with major stock indices experiencing gains as investors welcomed the apparent easing of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six major automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts, warning that these levies could jeopardize U.S. automotive production. The groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, argue that many auto suppliers are already financially strained and unable to absorb additional costs. They emphasize that the failure of even one supplier could disrupt entire production lines, leading to layoffs and broader industry problems. They are hoping for similar tariff relief to that recently approved for consumer electronics and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggesting a softening stance on tariffs against China may not indicate significant progress in trade talks but could give Beijing an advantage in negotiations, according to analysts. Trump stated that tariffs on Chinese goods "will not be as high as 145 per cent" and "won't be zero." Experts believe these comments reveal anxiety on the U.S. side and could allow China to secure a more favorable trade deal. Chen Zhiwu from the University of Hong Kong noted that there hasn't been any substantial change in negotiations.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its growth forecasts for major Asian economies in 2025, citing trade tensions and "high policy uncertainty." The IMF reduced GDP projections for China and India, and also cut Japan's growth forecast. Globally, growth was lowered due to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners, which the IMF described as a "major negative shock to growth." This forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth expectations for Asian economies amid escalating trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Steve Hilton, former advisor to David Cameron, has announced his candidacy for California governor in 2026, running as a Republican. He launched his campaign with the theme “Golden Again: Great Jobs, Great Homes, Great Kids,” focusing on positive solutions for working families. Hilton criticized state Democrats over high taxes and housing prices. He also welcomed the possibility of running against former Vice President Kamala Harris, emphasizing ability over identity. Republicans have not won a statewide race in California in nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>The Real ID deadline is approaching, and many states are not fully compliant, potentially causing disruptions at airport security checkpoints and federal buildings. A CBS News analysis revealed that several states have low compliance rates, meaning a significant portion of travelers may face additional screening or be denied entry. The Real ID Act was passed to enhance the security of state-issued identification. Travelers are advised to check their state's compliance status and obtain a Real ID or use an alternative form of identification.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging year due to the US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to concerns about price competition. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, potentially leading to reduced capital expenditure and slower expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also grappling with a price war resulting from overproduction. BESS are crucial for storing energy from renewable sources, and China and the US account for a significant portion of installed capacity.</p>

The decision follows years of criticism from animal rights advocates regarding the zoo's enclosure size and the health of its elephants. Concerns about Billy's well-being, including repetitive behaviors, have fueled calls for his relocation to a sanctuary. The L.A. Zoo cited the need for elephants to live in larger social groups as a reason for the move, as replacing deceased herd members is currently not feasible.</p>

In Chaoshan, the idea that more children bring more blessings and carry on the family name remains strong.

The first step in the plan is for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to revoke authorization of citrus red No. 2 and orange B. After that, the Department of Health and Human Services said, it will work with industry to eliminate six petroleum-based food dyes: blue 1, blue 2, green 3, red 40, yellow 5 and yellow 6.
