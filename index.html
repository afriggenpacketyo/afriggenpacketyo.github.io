          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and preventing new arrivals, citing South Sudan's failure to accept its nationals being deported from the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action is due to the transitional government in Juba "taking advantage of the United States". This measure is the first of its kind since Donald Trump's return to the White House. The U.S. has previously granted "temporary protected status" (TPS) to South Sudanese nationals, but the Trump administration has begun overturning these designations, reflecting a stricter stance on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming government consultation in England aims to address the significant health disparities affecting men, who are more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this include higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, and elevated cholesterol and blood pressure among men. Machismo and societal expectations also play a role, with men often discouraged from seeking help or discussing health concerns. The article also emphasizes the impact of deprivation on men's health, highlighting the need for tailored health services and interventions to address these issues.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban, minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, shared his views on transgender athletes participating in women's sports, suggesting that forcing trans inclusion on people is not the right approach. He believes the decision to compete against transgender athletes should be left to the individual athletes or teams. Cuban, a supporter of Joe Biden, also criticized the use of transgender issues in political campaigns. His comments align with a broader debate, as polls indicate that a majority of Americans, including many Democrats, oppose transgender athletes competing in women's sports.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports marks a significant shift away from the globalization process the U.S. once championed. These tariffs, intended to protect domestic jobs, represent a return to protectionism not seen in a century, potentially isolating the U.S. from global trade. The administration's rationale is based on the idea that countries with trade surpluses with the U.S. are "cheating," justifying tariffs to correct the imbalance. This approach deviates from the traditional economic theory of comparative advantage, which promotes free trade and specialization.</p>

Government attorneys argue that the judge lacks the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with a foreign power in such a manner. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 ruling that protected him from deportation, and the White House maintains he is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his attorneys deny.
