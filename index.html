          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has secured Bolivia's presidency in a run-off election, marking an end to two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. Paz won over 54% of the vote, inheriting a nation grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a severe US dollar shortage, 23% inflation, and a depreciating currency. Both Paz and his opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, reform state-owned businesses, and attract foreign investment, though their approaches to issues like IMF assistance and fuel subsidies varied. This political transition is expected to lead to a significant geopolitical realignment for Bolivia, fostering stronger relations with the United States.</p>

          <p>An Emirates cargo plane, a Boeing 747-481 operated by Turkish cargo airline Air ACT, veered off a runway at Hong Kong International Airport and plunged into the sea. The incident, which occurred around 03:50 local time upon arrival from Dubai, tragically resulted in the deaths of two airport ground staff after they fell into the water and were later pronounced dead at the hospital. The four crew members aboard the plane survived and received medical attention. While the affected runway is closed for investigation, the airport's two other runways continue to operate, though several cargo flights have been cancelled. This rare and serious accident has initiated a comprehensive inquiry into its cause.</p>

          <p>A late-night law enforcement operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District resulted in thirteen arrests, initially triggering significant social media concern over a potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid. Los Angeles County Sheriff officials subsequently clarified that federal immigration agents were not involved, attributing the arrests to local efforts targeting pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities. Videos circulated online depicted public frustration and confusion, with some posts warning of ICE presence at popular venues. This article highlights the heightened community sensitivity to immigration enforcement, even as local authorities addressed specific crime reports in the area.</p>

          <p>A brazen daytime heist occurred at the world-renowned Louvre Museum in Paris, where several individuals disguised as construction workers broke in and stole at least nine pieces of jewelry from Emperor Napoleon and his wife's collection. The thieves utilized a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor window, then used an angle grinder to smash display cases in the Apollo gallery, making off with items including crowns, necklaces, and brooches of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The meticulously planned operation lasted under seven minutes, with the culprits escaping on motorcycles. French authorities, including President Emmanuel Macron, have pledged a full investigation and committed to recovering the stolen treasures, emphasizing the attack on national heritage.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets commenced Monday with an upward trend as investors keenly awaited a series of crucial economic data releases from China. Reuters-polled analysts anticipate a deceleration in China's economy during the third quarter, forecasting a 4.8% year-on-year growth in gross domestic product for the July-to-September period, a decrease from the 5.2% recorded in the preceding quarter. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix, alongside South Korea's Kospi, registered gains. This positive regional performance mirrored an optimistic close on Wall Street, where U.S. markets were buoyed by a more conciliatory tone regarding U.S.-China trade discussions and a recovery from recent credit concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an escalating trade war with the United States, China is adopting tactics directly from the U.S. playbook, notably by expanding its export rules on rare earths. Beijing now mandates that foreign companies seek Chinese government approval to export magnets containing even minimal China-originated rare earth materials or produced with Chinese technology. This move mirrors the U.S.'s "foreign direct product rule," which extends American law to foreign-made products, and has been effectively used to curb China's access to U.S. technologies. China has also established an "Unreliable Entity List" and an anti-foreign sanction law, echoing U.S. measures. Experts view this as China learning from Washington's successful economic constraints, intensifying a tit-for-tat trade conflict with inherent risks of escalation for the global economy.</p>

          <p>According to analysts surveyed by Reuters, China's economic growth likely decelerated in the third quarter, with upcoming official data anticipated to corroborate this trend. Projections indicate that the gross domestic product (GDP) for the July-to-September period rose by 4.8% year-on-year, a dip from the 5.2% recorded in the preceding quarter. Furthermore, estimates suggest fixed-asset investment, encompassing real estate, expanded by a minimal 0.1% during the first nine months of the year. Retail sales are expected to have slowed to 3% in September, while industrial production likely eased to 5%. Despite these signs of a domestic slowdown, official September figures have highlighted the surprising resilience of China's exports, even amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

An Israeli security official stated that Hamas targeted Israeli forces with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire in an Israeli-controlled zone, labeling it a "bold violation" of the ceasefire. Prime Minister Netanyahu subsequently ordered "strong action" against "terrorist targets." Conversely, Hamas denied any involvement, reiterating its full commitment to the truce and asserting a lack of contact with its groups in the disputed area. Gaza hospital sources reported at least 38 fatalities from the Israeli strikes. While aid transfers into Gaza were initially paused, they later resumed, amidst mutual accusations of ceasefire breaches.</p>

          <p>In an extended 60 Minutes interview, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff discussed their unconventional role in brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, emphasizing their business-oriented "deal-maker" approach over traditional diplomacy. They revealed how President Trump empowered them to take risks, even leading to direct talks with Hamas, a significant departure from protocol. A critical turning point was Israel's bombing of Hamas negotiators in Doha, which initially jeopardized talks but ultimately led to Trump forcing an Israeli apology. The article details their focus on "pragmatic realism" and "interests over values," aiming to achieve peace and humanitarian aid delivery in Gaza, despite ongoing challenges like disarmament and reconstruction. They also address concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

Reuveni, who was fired after refusing to sign a brief that falsely labeled a deported Salvadoran man as a terrorist, claims he was shocked by directives to disregard court orders and mislead judges regarding mass deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Legal experts, including former Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler, affirm the DOJ's obligation to obey court orders and ensure due process. This article highlights growing concerns among judges and legal scholars about alleged abuses of power within the Trump Justice Department, with some judges explicitly criticizing the government for providing false information.</p>

          <p>Chandler Langevin, a city council member in Palm Bay, Florida, is encountering widespread condemnation and backlash for a series of social media posts containing derogatory remarks about Indian people and advocating for their mass deportation. Langevin's posts claimed that Indian immigrants arrive in the U.S. solely to "drain our pockets" before either returning to India or, "worse," choosing to remain. These comments have ignited significant anger from national Indian American organizations, members of Congress, and local residents, culminating in a formal censure by the Palm Bay city council. Advocacy groups are actively urging Governor Ron DeSantis to suspend Langevin, asserting that his "overtly bigoted, dehumanizing, and dangerous" rhetoric normalizes hostility towards minority communities and sets a perilous precedent.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was abruptly cancelled before kick-off, following what police characterized as "public disorder and violent riots." The unrest involved the deployment of dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices, leading to injuries for 12 civilians and three officers, along with nine arrests. This incident occurs shortly after UK officials banned Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from an upcoming Europa League match at Aston Villa due to safety concerns, a decision the UK government is now actively working to reverse. Hapoel Tel Aviv publicly criticized the cancellation, accusing the Israeli police of overreacting and preparing for "a war, not a sporting event," underscoring the escalating tensions surrounding football matches in the region.</p>

          <p>China's forthcoming Five Year Plan, scheduled to outline national goals from 2026 to 2030, continues a legacy of strategic blueprints that have profoundly altered the global economic and technological landscape. Historically, the "Reform and Opening Up" policy initiated in 1981 transformed China into an economic powerhouse, leading to significant global shifts, including the "China shock" of manufacturing jobs moving westward. Subsequent plans, such as the 2011-15 focus on "strategic emerging industries," propelled China to global leadership in green technology and secured its near-monopoly over critical rare earth supply chains. The current 2021-2025 plan emphasizes "high quality development," aiming to challenge American technological dominance and bolster China's long-term self-reliance, demonstrating the far-reaching impact of these centralized economic strategies.</p>

Qian stresses that the competition between the U.S. and China has broadened beyond trade to encompass technology and ideologies, advocating for managed accommodation to avert catastrophic miscalculations in an increasingly multipolar global order.

Two crucial distinctions for today's great power competition are highlighted: the proliferation of nuclear weapons, rendering total war irrational due to mutual assured destruction, and profound technological interdependence, which imposes unprecedented costs for systemic disruption. These interconnected factors, encompassing global supply chains and financial interdependencies, create compelling incentives for major economies to pursue patient statecraft and avoid catastrophic breakdowns.</p>

He is accused of coordinating armed fighters, requesting rifles and ammunition, with his phone reportedly pinging near Kibbutz Kfar Aza hours after the assault commenced. Despite later obtaining a fraudulent U.S. visa by denying terrorist affiliations, he has been charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and visa fraud.
