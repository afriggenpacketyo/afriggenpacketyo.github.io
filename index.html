          <p>San Bernardino County deputies have arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro, the parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, who was reported kidnapped last week. Investigators found inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's story and are now treating the case as a critical missing child investigation, believing the infant to be dead. Jake Haro, previously convicted of child cruelty, had another child removed from the home, and his ex-wife filed for a restraining order. Authorities are continuing their search for Emmanuel while reviewing security footage and following up on leads.</p>

          <p>Five people died after a tour bus overturned on the New York State Thruway in western New York, as it returned from Niagara Falls to New York City. The bus, carrying 52 people aged one to 74, lost control, veered into a median, and then a ditch, with many victims reportedly not wearing seatbelts and some ejected. Mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out, and an investigation is ongoing, with authorities seeking dashcam footage and appealing for blood donations.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has released over 300 pages of transcripts and audio from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, who received limited immunity for the interview, discussed her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and others in his orbit, including her interactions with Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, denying any inappropriate behavior by them. She also claimed a famous photo with Prince Andrew was "fake" and expressed skepticism about Epstein's death being a suicide.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured a commanding 69-17 victory over the United States in their World Cup opener, played before a record crowd of 42,723. Reigning World Player of the Year Ellie Kildunne delivered a stellar performance, contributing two tries and two assists. Despite the thrashing, head coach John Mitchell emphasized areas for improvement, noting some midfield passes went astray and urging greater clinicality, as the team aims to build pressure and refine their defense for tougher challenges ahead in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly issued a directive preventing the sharing of intelligence regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with 'Five Eyes' partners (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand). The memo classified this information as 'NOFORN,' limiting its distribution to originating agencies and raising concerns among some former officials about undermining trust and intelligence alliances. While some critics view this as a politicization of intelligence, others contend such directives are common when national interests diverge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an investigation into imported furniture, signaling forthcoming tariffs on a wide range of products within the next 50 days. Trump stated these tariffs aim to bring the furniture business back to states like North Carolina, South Carolina, and Michigan. Following the announcement, shares of major furniture and home goods companies like Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma tumbled, while La-Z-Boy, with mostly U.S. manufacturing, saw its shares rise. The move comes as the U.S. furniture industry already faces challenges from falling demand and a slow housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell sharply, losing almost $100 million in market value, following the release of its new, more minimalistic logo. The redesign, which removes the iconic overall-clad man, is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to refresh the brand and update its menu to appeal to a broader, more modern demographic. While the company insists its values remain unchanged, the move has drawn criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, highlighting the financial risks associated with significant brand overhauls in a politically charged environment.

Orman advises delaying Social Security, considering long-term care insurance, investing in income-producing assets, and prioritizing proactive health management to protect retirement savings.

This strongest indication yet of policy changes has led traders to place an 83% likelihood on a rate cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's criticism of the Smithsonian Institution for focusing on 'how bad slavery was' has ignited a debate over the accurate portrayal of American history in museums. The administration, with figures like JD Vance on the Smithsonian's board, reportedly seeks to micro-manage exhibits and replace historical truth with 'unifying and constructive descriptions,' removing content deemed to 'degrade shared American values.' Critics argue this attempt to whitewash history is an insult to Black and Indigenous Americans and prevents a true understanding of the nation's past and present inequities.</p>

          <p>FBI agents have reportedly raided the Maryland home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton to investigate whether he mishandled or shared classified material. The investigation follows 'intelligence collected overseas' by the CIA, though it is likely unrelated to his past dispute with Trump over his memoir's government clearance. While President Trump called Bolton a 'lowlife' and denied knowledge of the raid, Bolton, known for his punctilious nature, has a memory brimming with secrets, raising questions about potential leaks despite his cautious reputation.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are embroiled in a heated redistricting battle, poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five more congressional seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to counter by redrawing their own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats. This partisan 'arms race' over gerrymandering, though legal unless racially motivated, is unusual for its mid-decade timing and explicit political intent, with other states also considering similar countermeasures ahead of next year's national midterm elections.</p>

Powell's speech also highlighted a 'curious kind of balance' in a sluggish labor market and noted that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices, complicating the Fed's efforts to manage inflation and employment.
