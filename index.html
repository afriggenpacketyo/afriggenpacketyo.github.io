          <p>A 78-year-old retired education professor details the five daily practices he credits for his sharp memory and cognitive function. These habits include regular social interaction to combat stress, lifelong learning by reading on diverse subjects, and using a personal organizational system like color-coded notes. He also emphasizes the importance of daily physical activity, such as swimming and walking, to increase blood flow to the brain, alongside maintaining a nutrient-rich diet and getting adequate sleep. The author frames these activities not as chores but as a proactive, full-time commitment to brain health.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Scotland have set a new world record by completing the fastest unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean, traveling over 9,000 miles from Peru to Australia in 139 days. Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan Maclean overcame severe weather and personal injuries to become the first team to row the full distance from South America to Australia without stopping. Their journey also served as a significant fundraising effort for clean water projects in Madagascar, raising over £700,000 for their charity, the Maclean Foundation. The previous record for this challenging maritime feat was 160 days, set in 2014.</p>

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the contrived ways humans interact with the natural world they are simultaneously altering. Nelson argues that as humanity distances itself from genuine nature, it creates curated, hyper-managed illusions like staged tourist experiences and artificial zoo habitats. The project, spanning six years and 14 countries, captures the unsettling paradox of seeking reassurance from manufactured versions of the wild while the real environments are being destroyed. These images reveal the cracks in these illusions, serving as monuments to what has been lost.</p>

Two of the victims, Fergus Ward and Lewis Knox, were identified as regular first-team members of the Fort William Shinty Club, with deep family ties to the organization. The club and the wider community are mourning the loss of the three young men, with local schools offering support services.

          <p>Marking ten years in power, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has driven profound societal and economic changes, rewiring the kingdom's traditional structure. Key reforms include significantly advancing women's rights by lifting the driving ban and easing guardianship laws, which has boosted female participation in the workforce to 36%. The article also notes the sidelining of the religious police, the opening of cultural and entertainment sectors, and a major anti-corruption campaign.

          <p>On the eve of a state visit to China, Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to deepen the strategic partnership between the two nations while condemning what he calls attempts to distort World War II history. During his four-day trip, Putin is scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping and attend China's Victory Day parade as the guest of honor. In an interview, Putin emphasized a common stance with China against discriminatory sanctions, referencing Western economic penalties imposed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

          <p>A Palestinian-American writer questions why it took 21 months for Western institutions and media to begin using the term "genocide" to describe the situation in Gaza, a warning Palestinians had been issuing since late 2023. The author argues that the delay stems from the persistent dehumanization of Palestinians, which renders their suffering less credible to outside observers until it reaches a form, like famine, that Western consciences can more easily process. The article critiques the media's framing of the conflict, which often strips away historical context and forces Palestinians to condemn Hamas before their grief is acknowledged. It calls for immediate sanctions and respect for Palestinian self-determination.</p>

The analysis considered factors like financial aid, academic rigor, and post-graduation earnings, finding that many top private schools provide generous aid packages that can make them more affordable than public institutions. For example, Princeton students on financial aid pay an average of just $10,555 annually and earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The report highlights that many elite private universities have "no-loan" policies, covering attendance costs for students with demonstrated financial need. (not investment advice)</p>

All winnings are subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding, with the final tax bill likely falling in the top 37% bracket.

Critics argue that politicizing the Fed could undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system and erode the credibility it has built over decades. Control over the Fed's Board of Governors would give the executive branch influence over not just interest rates but also bank regulation and the integrity of the Treasury system. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, legal scholars warn it could lead to economic instability similar to that in countries where leaders dictate monetary policy.

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's Executive Order on Flag-Burning is Unconstitutional and Counterproductive</h2>

          <p>President Trump's executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burners is likely to be legally ineffective and may backfire, according to this analysis. The Supreme Court has twice ruled, in cases from 1989 and 1990, that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The article argues that while flag-burners could be charged under content-neutral laws against public burning, the executive order's explicit focus on the act's message could provide defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense. Ultimately, the order is described as an empty threat that will likely encourage more protests without expanding the government's legal authority.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Urges University of California to Sue Trump Administration Over Frozen Research Funds</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the University of California system should legally challenge the Trump administration's decision to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research grants rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, a co-counsel in a similar successful lawsuit brought by Harvard, contends the funding cuts are illegal, violating federal law and the First Amendment by targeting research based on its perceived viewpoint. The article warns that a settlement would legitimize what it calls extortion, set a dangerous precedent, and potentially force the university to abandon diversity programs and gender-affirming care, betraying its core values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the recent shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, this opinion article reflects on the repetitive cycle of tragedy, grief, and inaction surrounding school shootings in America. The author highlights the words of the school's principal, Matthew DeBoer, who invoked an African proverb: "When you pray, move your feet." This sentiment calls for concrete action to prevent future violence, rather than relying solely on thoughts and prayers. The article underscores the profound sense of hopelessness that follows such events while simultaneously urging the community and nation to translate their sorrow into meaningful change to protect children.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and The Guardian has linked major sportswear brands, including Nike and Chinese companies Anta, Li-Ning, and 361 Degrees, to forced labor involving ethnic minorities from China's Xinjiang region. These brands, which have lucrative sponsorship deals with prominent NBA players, are connected to factories participating in government-run labor transfer programs. The report highlights the case of former player Enes Kanter Freedom, who believes his activism on this issue cost him his NBA career. The findings raise ethical questions about the league's and players' commercial ties to companies implicated in human rights abuses.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Global Tariffs an Illegal Overreach of Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 07:52:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad, reciprocal tariffs imposed on most trading partners are an illegal use of presidential authority. The 7-4 decision found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the power to impose taxes or duties. The court has allowed the tariffs to remain in place until mid-October to permit an appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling creates significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade, as a final decision could impact billions in collected taxes and numerous trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates that beta-blockers, a standard treatment following a heart attack for 40 years, provide no benefit for most patients with preserved heart function and may increase risks for some women. A large clinical trial found that women with normal heart function after a heart attack who were treated with beta-blockers had a significantly higher risk of another heart attack, heart failure, and death compared to those not given the drug. These findings are expected to reshape international treatment guidelines, suggesting a need for a more sex-specific approach to cardiovascular care. The drug remains beneficial for patients with significantly reduced heart function.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Henry Jackson Society warns that the potential collapse of the Iranian regime could create a power vacuum, leading to civil war and widespread regional instability. The analysis suggests that recent setbacks, including Israeli strikes and the loss of regional proxies, have weakened the regime, but its fall is not guaranteed to lead to a positive outcome. The worst-case scenarios include a takeover by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or the rise of another authoritarian, anti-Western government. The report advises Western nations to support a viable, unified opposition to ensure a quick and stable transition to a participatory democracy.</p>

          <p>Legacy coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, evolve. The rising popularity of trendy, health-conscious beverages like matcha, championed by newer chains like Blank Street Coffee, is creating intense competition. Analysts suggest that in an era of high living costs and sophisticated home coffee machines, large chains are caught in the middle, lacking the value of budget options or the unique experience of artisanal shops. This shift in consumer behavior, combined with inflationary pressures, has led Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, to explore a potential sale of the brand.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's proposed "autumn of reform" is creating friction within his coalition government as he aims to overhaul the welfare state and implement tax changes to stimulate the struggling economy. Merz's center-right CDU party is at odds with its center-left SPD partners, who favor raising taxes on the wealthy over cutting welfare benefits to address a significant budget shortfall. The chancellor faces the dilemma of pleasing his conservative base while maintaining a functional coalition with the SPD, which effectively holds veto power. This political tension highlights the immense challenge of balancing Germany's books amid economic stagnation and demographic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
