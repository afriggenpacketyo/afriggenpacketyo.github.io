        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that President Trump can maintain control of the National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles, thereby staying a lower court order that would have returned command to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The court stated that the president likely acted lawfully under his statutory authority, even though he failed to notify the governor before deploying the National Guard as required by law, as Newsom had no power to veto the order. The judges cited violence during protests as the basis for federalizing the guard, as protesters had pinned down federal officers and damaged federal buildings. The ruling emphasizes the deference given to the President in national security decisions.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, influenced by a recent trade deal with the U.S. The 1-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, and the 5-year LPR is at 3.5%, aligning with economists' expectations. This decision follows a rate cut last month, the first since October, intended to mitigate trade tensions with the U.S., coupled with commercial banks reducing deposit rates to protect their net interest margins. The trade truce has provided Beijing with some flexibility to support its currency and has raised hopes that the economic impact will be less severe than initially anticipated (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts trial; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed as part of a coverup involving law enforcement. The trial included contentious arguments over evidence, witness testimony, and allegations of misconduct by investigators. The timeline of events leading to O'Keefe's death and the subsequent investigation were heavily scrutinized throughout the legal proceedings.</p>

Israel's defense minister accused Iran of war crimes and stated that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable. Israel retaliated by striking Iran's Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, claiming it was targeting Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site. Concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, or "bunker busters," against Fordow, which is built deep into a mountain south of Tehran. Israel lacks the capacity to significantly damage the secretive site, making U.S. involvement and its bunker-buster bombs crucial for any potential strike.

The ruling challenges the "Duffy Directive," which imposed conditions on grant funding related to immigration enforcement and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

Simultaneously, Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, driven by rising food costs.

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in May increased by 3.7% compared to the previous year, marking the most significant rise in over two years, primarily due to soaring rice and food costs. The inflation rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, rose by 7.7%, with rice prices jumping by 101.7% due to supply shortages. While fresh food prices have slightly decreased, experts anticipate rice prices will decline with the new harvest in the fall (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument is at risk of removal due to the Trump administration's movement against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and proposed budget cuts to the National Park Service. A legal opinion from the Justice Department gives presidents the ability to revoke or shrink certain national monuments for the first time since the 1930s, with some land reportedly under consideration for mineral extractions. Proposed budget cuts could potentially force the closure of over 300 park sites, including the Till monument. The monument, designated in 2023, consists of sites in Mississippi and Illinois that commemorate the story of Emmett Till and his impact on the civil rights movement.</p>

          <p>President Trump appeared to criticize Juneteenth in a Truth Social post, arguing that the United States has "too many non-working holidays," costing the country billions of dollars. The post, which did not explicitly mention Juneteenth, suggested that workers don't want these holidays either and that the situation must change to "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged Juneteenth as a federal holiday but did not indicate any plans for the president to commemorate it. The holiday commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War and has been a federal holiday since 2021.</p>
