          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the discovery of the remains of all seven workers who were missing after a large explosion at a fireworks warehouse. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property owner is a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant whose home was also destroyed. Federal and state agencies are investigating the cause of the fatal blast while families of the victims are calling for justice.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 95 deaths, with dozens of people still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and summer camps, including Camp Mystic, which confirmed the deaths of 27 campers and counselors. A major disaster has been declared, and a massive search and rescue operation is underway, though officials warn that the true number of missing people may be higher due to the many campers in the area.</p>

          <p>David Jones, a veteran Conservative politician who served as a cabinet minister and MP for nearly two decades, has announced he is joining the Reform UK party. In a statement, the former Welsh Secretary said he had become "disillusioned" with the Conservative Party, claiming it no longer reflects his values. His defection to Nigel Farage's party marks the third such move by a former Tory MP in two weeks, indicating a continuing realignment on the right of British politics.</p>

          <p>A new street mural celebrating Los Angeles Dodgers player Kiké Hernández has appeared in North Hollywood. The artwork was inspired by a recent social media post in which Hernández, who is from Puerto Rico, voiced support for the city's immigrant communities amid an increase in federal enforcement raids. The artist, Louie Palsino, stated the mural honors Hernández for "defending what is right" and standing in solidarity with the people of his adopted city.</p>

          <p>A new lead has emerged in the manhunt for Travis Decker, the Washington state man accused of killing his three young daughters over a month ago. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating a tip from a family who believes they saw a man matching Decker's description in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest over the holiday weekend. Authorities are now focusing search efforts in the remote area, hoping for a break in the case that began when the girls' bodies were discovered in June.</p>

          <p>A month after resuming his two-way duties for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani is demonstrating significant progress, especially with his pitching. While still on a limited pitch count following his second major elbow surgery, he has been effective on the mound, with his fastball routinely exceeding 100 mph. Although his offensive numbers have seen a minor dip, he continues to be one of the league's top hitters, and the team is carefully managing his workload to maximize his dual impact.</p>

          <p>With growing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, this article advises homeowners on how to prepare for borrowing via a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). It recommends three key actions to take now: review your credit report and score for improvements, shop around and compare different lenders, and carefully calculate potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios. These steps can help borrowers secure more favorable terms on a variable-rate HELOC when rates eventually drop. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After posting its worst first-half return since 1973, the U.S. dollar continues to face significant headwinds that could weaken it further. Analysts point to factors like U.S. policy volatility, swelling national debt, and the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts as primary drivers of the decline. This trend has broad market implications, as a weaker dollar can boost U.S. exports but also raises long-term concerns about the stability of American assets and the dollar's role as the world's primary reserve currency.

          <p>Dozens of heavily armed federal immigration agents descended on MacArthur Park in Los Angeles in a significant show of force. The operation, which included agents on horseback and in armored vehicles, is part of a federally funded increase in immigration enforcement that has seen over 1,600 arrests in the city in recent weeks. The raid was met with protests and drew Mayor Karen Bass to the scene, who demanded the agents leave what she called an unacceptable action in the heart of the city's immigrant community.</p>
