          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris closed after a sophisticated daytime heist targeted France's priceless crown jewels. Thieves used power tools and a mechanical lift to access the Galerie d'Apollon, escaping on scooters with eight 19th-century royal items, including diadems and necklaces. Two items, including Empress Eugénie's crown, were dropped during the escape and recovered. No one was injured, and authorities are investigating the professional operation, which has stunned France and raised questions about museum security.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a 'suspicious stand' near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequently used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The agency found 'items of interest' while sweeping the area before Trump's arrival, including what appeared to be a platform high in a tree. Officials stated there was no impact on presidential movements and no individuals were present. This incident follows an attempted assassination against the president at his nearby golf club last year, highlighting ongoing security concerns.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter used her 'Saturday Night Live' hosting and musical guest appearance to subtly address criticism of her winking pop persona and suggestive album visuals. In a QVC sketch, she played a designer seemingly oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her product, mirroring real-life reactions to her work. Her opening monologue and other sketches directly referenced controversies, such as her 'Man’s Best Friend' album cover. The article suggests Carpenter is intentionally in on the joke, challenging those who overly scrutinize her sexuality.</p>

          <p>Former Republican US Representative George Santos, recently released from prison after his sentence for wire fraud and identity theft was commuted by President Trump, has announced a new mission: prison reform. Santos described his 84-day federal prison experience as 'dehumanizing' and 'humbling,' detailing poor conditions like mold and broken air conditioning. He informed Trump of his intention to assist the administration in this area. Santos, who is not seeking re-election for at least a decade, aims to improve the 'broken' prison system.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic drop in tobacco consumption per capita over two decades, largely due to stronger policies on taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth, and the region faces new challenges like the rapid rise of e-cigarettes. While some countries have banned vaping, others, like Malaysia, face political resistance to stricter regulations. Indonesia remains a notable exception, not having ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework, and recently scrapped a planned tobacco tax hike.</p>

These programs are set to phase out by July 1, 2028, under President Trump's 'big beautiful bill.' The administration also clarified that forgiveness granted in 2025 will be exempt from federal taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bolivia is ushering in a new political era with a presidential run-off election between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, ending two decades of leftist rule. The country faces its worst economic crisis in decades, marked by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both candidates promise to stabilize the economy, fix the exchange rate, and attract foreign investment, differing on approaches to IMF loans and fuel subsidies. This election signals a significant shift in Bolivia's alliances, moving away from China and Russia towards stronger ties with the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, as suggested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. This move is part of efforts to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, with the Chancellor expected to announce targeted actions in the November Budget. Scrapping VAT on domestic energy could save average households £86 annually but would cost the government an estimated £2.5 billion per year. Miliband emphasized that long-term bill reduction depends on transitioning to home-grown clean power.</p>

Despite Vice-President JD Vance suggesting it represented American colors, the incident fueled speculation about the Trump administration's stance on Ukraine.

He also advocated aligning capital gains tax with income tax to tax 'unearned wealth' equally. Polanski emphasized that while public services require broad contributions, the immediate focus should be on the 'super wealthy.' (not investment advice)</p>

The Food Safety and Inspection Service urged institutions not to serve these products, which include various brands and meats. While no illnesses have been confirmed, Listeria can cause severe infections, particularly in vulnerable populations, and is a leading cause of foodborne illness deaths.</p>
