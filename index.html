          <p>The European Union is preparing to announce additional countermeasures in response to U.S. tariffs, according to European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic. These steps include possible rebalancing measures and areas for further discussions, as the EU continues to prepare for all scenarios if trade talks fail. While negotiations remain the priority, the EU is consulting with member states and industry stakeholders to ensure readiness for any outcome. Trump initially imposed a 20% tariff on EU goods, later paused and lowered to 10% for negotiations, while tariffs on foreign cars, steel, and aluminum remain.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the Trump administration finds Russia's opening offer to end the war with Ukraine "asking for too much." Vance emphasized the importance of direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine for a long-term settlement. While the U.S. acknowledges Russia's interest in resolving the conflict, it believes the current demands are excessive. Vance indicated Trump is willing to withdraw from negotiations if progress stalls, urging both sides to agree on basic guidelines for talks. Despite Trump's claims of brokering peace, Russian military strikes have continued, and he has criticized Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, are pushing for a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing amidst President Trump‚Äôs controversial tariffs. The bill aims to extend the 2017 tax law, primarily reduced personal income tax rates, to calm markets and boost the economy. However, many Republicans fear the tax bill won't offset the economic damage caused by the tariffs, especially as Trump frames the extension as tax cuts ‚Äúfor everybody,‚Äù despite most people seeing no actual cut. The author, who helped pass the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, argues that while extending the law is necessary, it won't solve the economic issues created by Trump's trade policy.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current interest rates due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs will cause inflation while also hindering economic growth. Fed officials are closely monitoring data for signs of rising consumer prices or a weakening labor market, seeking clarity on Trump's economic policies. The central bank's decision hinges on whether tariff-induced price increases are temporary or lead to persistent inflation. The article notes that the Fed faces tricky trade-offs, as sweeping tariffs, spending cuts, and mass deportations risk both stoking inflation and damaging growth.</p>

The visit comes amid ongoing sectarian violence and deep uncertainty in Syria. Macron and al-Shara discussed Syria's political transition, security, counterterrorism efforts, economic aid, and regional stability. Despite skepticism due to al-Shara's past as an Islamist rebel leader, France seeks to encourage further progress in Syria's political transition and counterterrorism efforts.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Republican women are employing social media to promote their political agendas. It focuses on the hyperfeminine and overtly Christian look of Republican women who are ascendant in the Trump administration and how this contrasts with their often blunt language. The article suggests that this aesthetic and tactics are built to go viral, but that this kind of power isn't enduring or a deeper source of political influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a review of the University of Washington following a pro-Palestinian protest that resulted in arrests. The review aims to address alleged "antisemitic violence" after protesters occupied an engineering building, demanding the university sever ties with Boeing. The administration praised the university's response but insists more must be done to ensure a safe environment for Jewish students. This review is part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses under the Trump administration.</p>
