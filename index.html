          <h2>China to Resume Japanese Seafood Imports After Fukushima Wastewater Dispute</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to lift its two-year ban on seafood imports from Japan, which was imposed due to concerns over the discharge of treated wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to resume once China completes its necessary procedures, which include participating in water sampling missions with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan will also register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities and provide inspection certifications confirming the absence of radioactive substances like caesium-137. China is expected to announce the resumption of exports from areas outside the Fukushima region soon. The ban was initially implemented in 2023, with China citing risks to its fishing industry and coastal communities. </p>

The administration argued that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals. Trump rebuked the lower court judges, calling their decision "wrong" and "horrible." </p>

          <p>The coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of boulders along the rail and will place up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand between Mariposa and North beaches. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is also preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail.
