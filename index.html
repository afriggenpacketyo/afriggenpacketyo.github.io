          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebel group has intensified its targeting of humanitarian aid workers, recently detaining at least 11 United Nations personnel in Sanaa and Hodeidah. This action is viewed as part of a broader internal security crackdown following an Israeli airstrike that killed several Houthi government officials. Experts suggest the Houthis are using the detentions as leverage and to consolidate power amid paranoia of infiltration, creating a severe crisis for aid operations in a country where over 21 million people require humanitarian assistance. These abductions are part of a long-standing pattern of forced disappearances targeting civilians, activists, and anyone linked to international organizations.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 81, was seriously injured in a car crash in New Hampshire after stopping to assist a domestic violence victim. A spokesman confirmed the incident was not a targeted attack, stating that Giuliani's rental vehicle was struck from behind at high speed after he had called 911 for the woman. Giuliani sustained multiple injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebra, and was hospitalized in improving condition. New Hampshire State Police are investigating the two-vehicle collision, which also resulted in non-life-threatening injuries for Giuliani's driver and the 19-year-old driver of the other car.</p>

The incident occurred in the town of Dobra ahead of the country's parliamentary elections scheduled for October. Police immediately detained the assailant and are investigating the assault as an act of hooliganism. Current Prime Minister Petr Fiala condemned the attack, which comes as Babis's opposition party, ANO, is leading in public opinion polls and has a strong chance of winning the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating his actions are jeopardizing the health of Americans. In a New York Times op-ed, the bipartisan group, whose service spans from the Carter to the Trump administrations, cited a series of alarming decisions by Kennedy, including firing top health officials, dismantling the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, and canceling mRNA vaccine research. They argue that these moves weaken the nation's ability to respond to public health threats and are calling on Congress to exercise its oversight authority over the HHS.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has devastated remote villages in eastern Afghanistan, with the United Nations reporting at least 800 fatalities. The quake struck near midnight on Sunday, collapsing homes made of mud and timber and trapping residents under rubble in the mountainous Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. Eyewitnesses describe scenes of shock and despair, with entire families lost and survivors left homeless, sleeping in the open.

          <p>Hundreds of PBS and NPR stations across the United States are grappling with the elimination of $1.1 billion in federal funding by Congress, a move championed by the Trump administration. The sudden budget shortfall is forcing stations to launch emergency fundraising drives, cut jobs, and reduce local programming. While public response has been strong in some areas, many smaller and rural stations face an existential threat. National networks are reducing dues to help, and a philanthropic effort is underway, but leaders fear some vulnerable stations may not survive the cuts long-term, potentially impacting emergency alert systems and local news coverage.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas following a jet ski collision with another vessel off the coast of Paradise Island. The man was found unresponsive with visible injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel.

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of several classic novels, including Atwood's own 'The Handmaid's Tale.' Her new story ironically describes two "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family without ever having sex, mocking the sanitized reality the ban seems to promote. The move highlights a growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the United States, spreading to Canada.</p>

          <p>Research from the University of Montpellier indicates that human activities caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals starting in the Middle Ages. By analyzing over 225,000 animal bones from the past 8,000 years in France, scientists found that wild species like foxes and deer began to shrink. This was attributed to habitat fragmentation and intensified hunting. Concurrently, domesticated species such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger due to increasingly systematic selective breeding and controlled management, showcasing the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

This phenomenon can blur the lines between fiction and reality, leading some fans to direct anger and harassment towards the actors.

While passengers welcome the cheaper tickets, with a Glasgow-Edinburgh return fare cut nearly in half, experts are divided on the broader implications.

EU officials, caught off guard by the warning, defend their right to regulate their digital markets, setting the stage for a potential confrontation over technology policy and trade.

          <p>David Warburton, who served as the Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome until his resignation in 2023, has died suddenly in London at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was suspended from the Conservative Party in 2022 following allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned from politics after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election for his seat. A former colleague remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose widespread tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the president's justification for the levies, which cited U.S. trade deficits as a national emergency, exceeded the power granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. However, the ruling will not take effect immediately, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision represents a significant legal challenge to one of the administration's cornerstone economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The quake's shallow depth amplified its destructive power in a region where buildings are often constructed from mud and timber, leading to many collapses. Rescue operations are severely hindered by the mountainous terrain, landslides, and limited communications. The crisis is compounded by Afghanistan's economic collapse since the Taliban takeover, with a collapsed healthcare system and suspended foreign aid creating immense challenges for a nation already facing a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

This approach, combined with financial independence and the artistic direction of conductor Paavo Jarvi, has fostered a deep sense of ownership and motivation among its members. The film showcases their passionate interpretation of Joseph Haydn's symphonies, linking the composer's own journey to freedom with the orchestra's democratic spirit.</p>

Climate scientists note that a summer this warm is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change, with the five hottest summers all occurring since the year 2000. The season was characterized by prolonged and widespread heat, with four separate heatwave events, rather than a single extreme temperature spike, contributing to the new record.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies could severely impact California's $4 trillion economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor. A study from the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates the state could lose up to $278 billion in GDP due to mass deportations and stricter border controls. Industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, which have high concentrations of both documented and undocumented immigrant workers, are particularly vulnerable. Proponents of the policy argue it creates jobs for U.S. citizens, but economists warn of profound skill shortages without immigrant workers.</p>
