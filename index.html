          <p>US stocks experienced a significant rally driven by signals of a potential thaw in the trade war between the US and China, alongside positive news for Tesla. President Trump indicated that tariffs on China would be reduced, and Treasury Secretary Bessent expressed optimism about reaching a "big deal." Tesla shares soared following CEO Elon Musk's announcement that he would dedicate more time to the company after his work with the Department of Government Efficiency winds down, while other tech giants like Meta and Nvidia also saw gains.

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas strongly criticized Hamas, calling them "sons of dogs" and demanding they release hostages, disarm, and cede control of Gaza to end the war with Israel. Abbas stated Hamas provided Israel with excuses to continue attacks and urged them to relinquish control of Gaza and transform into a political party. A Hamas official condemned Abbas's remarks, highlighting the deep divisions between the two Palestinian factions. The article also mentions Hamas releasing a video of an Israeli hostage and reports on an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed 11,500 acres and is approximately 30% contained, prompting a state of emergency declaration. While one commercial building and several vehicles have been destroyed, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service reports no injuries or loss of life, and no single-family homes were damaged despite 1,300 being threatened. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations for 5,000 residents have been lifted, and major roads have reopened. Officials attribute the fire's rapid spread to dry conditions and expect the acreage to increase as containment efforts continue, potentially making it the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years.</p>

          <p>International tourism to the United States is experiencing a slump, while American travel abroad is surging, creating a widening gap in travel spending.

Conversely, U.S. citizens flying abroad increased by 1.6% compared to last March and are up 22% from 2019. Factors contributing to this imbalance include trade tensions, concerns about detentions of foreign visitors, President Trump's rhetoric, and a strong U.S. dollar, which makes international travel more attractive for Americans.</p>

The comments came amid a legal battle over deportations, including a Supreme Court order temporarily blocking the deportation of Venezuelan migrants.

While there were no reported deaths or major structural damage, authorities closed schools for several days and advised residents to remain outdoors.

          <p>President Trump's suggestion for automakers to move vehicle production to the U.S. faces significant challenges, including upcoming tariffs on auto parts and the complex process of relocating production lines. Relocating production lines takes years of planning and construction, including hiring workers, building infrastructure, and establishing a parts supply chain. Automotive executives and experts agree that more time would be helpful, but an extension to bolster U.S. manufacturing isn't so simple. The fastest way to increase U.S. production is to utilize existing facilities, for which supply chains have already been established.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in the stock market is largely attributed to a "short squeeze," where short sellers are forced to buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses, creating artificial buying pressure. Hedge fund short sellers had increased bearish wagers after President Trump's tariff rollout, creating an environment ripe for a dramatic upswing. The market's rally, fueled by Trump's walk back of comments on China and the Federal Reserve, is largely due to this phenomenon. Analysts suggest that the market appeared poised for a relief rally as many hedge funds were caught on the wrong side of their bets.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump continued to express a positive outlook on tariffs, stating that the U.S. is actively engaged in discussions with China and remains confident in reaching a fair deal. He emphasized that the country was losing significant amounts of money under previous administrations, particularly Biden, and that China had become "out of control." Trump promised that the U.S. would substantially lower taxes and would no longer be taken advantage of by other countries, asserting that the country would now be making a lot of money through tariff negotiations.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets have surged following President Trump's indication that tariffs on China would be reduced "substantially" and his statement that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell. The shift in tone from the White House, after weeks of tough talk on trade, has boosted investor confidence. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also expressed optimism about China's potential for change, suggesting a collaborative approach to rebalancing the global economy.

          <p>BP shares experienced volatility after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake of over 5% in the oil major. Elliott's involvement has fueled speculation that it could pressure BP to shift away from its green strategy and focus more on its core oil and gas businesses. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a strategic departure from its earlier commitment to cut emissions to net zero. The move comes after BP posted a steep drop in fourth-quarter profit, lagging behind its competitors.</p>

This positive momentum follows President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and rhetoric against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Analysts attribute the recent surge to investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that is consistently proving its value as a portfolio diversification and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.</p>
