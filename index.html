          <p>President Trump announced the immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada, citing the country's new digital services tax on large technology companies as a "blatant attack." The move escalates economic tensions between the two major trading partners, with Trump stating that new tariff rates for Canada will be announced within a week. Canada's 3% tax, which primarily affects U.S. tech giants, is expected to cost these companies billions. This breakdown in negotiations comes just a week after the two countries' leaders met at the G7 summit.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limits the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his policies. The 6-3 ruling, which arose from challenges to his birthright citizenship order, was praised by Trump as a check on "radical left judges." However, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, leaving it open for future legal battles. Democratic leaders condemned the decision, calling it a dangerous step toward authoritarianism and a threat to the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging 44% this month. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further growth potential, partly due to its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring company, Circle. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is buoyed by increasing institutional interest. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision significantly curtails the use of universal injunctions, a legal tool lower courts have used to block presidential policies nationwide. This ruling stems from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. A universal injunction is a court order that stops the government from enforcing a policy against anyone, not just the parties in a specific case. The article explains that while this limits a key strategy for challenging executive actions, it will likely shift legal battles toward other methods, such as class-action lawsuits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses to absorb the initial impact. These include front-loading inventory before tariffs took effect, temporarily absorbing costs to protect consumers, and utilizing legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that this stability may be temporary, and price increases could still materialize later if tariffs remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court decision upholding a key part of the Affordable Care Act has raised concerns among health law experts about the potential for politicized science. The ruling affirmed that the health secretary has direct oversight of an expert panel that recommends preventive services. Experts worry this gives Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. complete power over these crucial recommendations. The decision came just after a vaccine panel, recently restocked by Kennedy with ideological allies, recommended against using a long-established and safe vaccine preservative, highlighting fears of a new "war against science."</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus is reportedly considering ending production at its historic UK headquarters and moving operations to the United States. The potential shift, which would place 1,300 jobs at risk in Hethel, Norfolk, is being reviewed as the company faces disruption from U.S. tariffs on imported cars. America is a key market for Lotus, and the 25% import tax threatens its business model. The company, majority-owned by Chinese group Geely, has already cut jobs this year amid volatile market conditions.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 is abuzz with speculation about a potential move by champion driver Max Verstappen from Red Bull to Mercedes, a topic openly discussed by current Mercedes driver George Russell. While Verstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028, his team's recent performance dip and questions about its 2026 engine program could make a switch attractive. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has not denied the talks, though he called the move "not realistic at this stage." A potential deal faces hurdles, including Verstappen's high salary and complex team dynamics.</p>

The article notes that since both have variable rates, savers should consider their comfort with potential rate changes versus a fixed-rate CD. (not investment advice)</p>
