          <p>More than 530 people were arrested at a London demonstration supporting the recently banned group, Palestine Action, marking the largest number of arrests by the Metropolitan Police in a single day in the last decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards in support of the group, which the government proscribed as a terrorist organization in July. While human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a threat to free expression, the Home Secretary defended the ban, citing security advice about serious attacks committed by the group. The Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now preparing to press charges against the arrested individuals.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers have strongly criticized the Republican-led push for mid-decade redistricting in Texas, labeling it an undemocratic attempt to "cheat" and secure an unfair advantage in upcoming elections. To block the move, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum, prompting Governor Greg Abbott to threaten their arrest upon return. Prominent Democrats like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Sen. Bernie Sanders defended the tactic as a necessary response to what they call an "outrageous" power grab initiated by Donald Trump. The proposed new maps could potentially give the GOP five additional House seats.</p>

          <p>A California toy store was robbed of approximately $7,000 worth of Labubu dolls, a popular collectible toy that has seen a massive surge in global demand. Surveillance footage captured at least four masked individuals breaking into the La Puente store and making off with boxes of the merchandise. The Labubu toy, which originated in China, has become a billion-dollar industry, with its popularity driven by celebrity sightings and a "blind box" sales model that encourages repeat purchases. This high demand has also led to a resale market where the dolls can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military offensive into Gaza City, asserting it is the only way to achieve the "complete the defeat of Hamas" and end the war speedily. The plan, which has drawn international condemnation and prompted an emergency UN Security Council meeting, involves dismantling Hamas's remaining strongholds while moving civilians to designated safe zones. Netanyahu stated the goal is not to occupy Gaza but to demilitarize it and install a non-Israeli civilian administration. The announcement comes amid a dire humanitarian situation, with recent reports of at least 26 Palestinians killed while seeking aid.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency has transitioned from a niche interest to a significant force in Washington and on Wall Street, bolstered by President Trump's recent support and a massive industry lobbying effort. Legislation like the Genius Act, which allows major corporations to issue digital currencies, and a new regulatory bill are reshaping the financial landscape. However, critics, including a former SEC official, warn that the industry is highly speculative, rife with scams, and that the proposed regulations are largely written by and for the crypto industry itself. This new embrace of digital assets marks a significant shift from previous administrations, raising both opportunities and consumer protection concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy justified the cut by claiming the technology is ineffective, a statement Adams called "simply not true," citing the millions of lives saved by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Adams emphasized that the technology, a key part of Trump's Operation Warp Speed, is crucial for developing treatments for cancer, HIV, and the flu. He also criticized Kennedy's response to a recent shooting at the CDC, suggesting his rhetoric has contributed to a hostile environment.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have launched a murder investigation after a man was found dead in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Authorities suspect the death may be connected to a separate, serious assault that occurred earlier the same day, in which a priest, Fr. John Murray, was struck on the head with a bottle inside St Patrick's Church. The priest was hospitalized in serious condition following what police described as a "completely shocking and brutal attack." Local political leaders have expressed horror at the events that have shaken the community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The summit follows Trump's persistent efforts to broker a peace deal, including a recent ultimatum for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. The meeting's location in Alaska, a former Russian territory, holds historical significance. While the U.S. hopes to achieve a deal "to stop the killing," Ukraine, which is not currently slated to attend, has expressed concern that any agreement made without its input would be a "dead decision" and has rejected the idea of ceding territory.</p>

He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he ordered and paid via a screen, yet was still presented with options to tip 15%, 20%, or 22%. Sedaris humorously questions who the tip is for when he has done most of the work himself.

She explains that a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and it allows individuals to shape the narrative about their skills and talents rather than being underestimated. Chan, who built her own brand through consistent content creation on LinkedIn, advises starting with small, regular actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one update a week.

          <p>Large sections of central Beijing, including the area around Tiananmen Square, were blocked off from Saturday evening to Sunday morning for a major military parade rehearsal. The full parade is scheduled for September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in World War II. According to state media, the rehearsal was a comprehensive test of the event's organizational and command operations. The final event will see troops and military hardware travel along Changan Avenue and past Tiananmen Square, where President Xi Jinping is expected to preside over the ceremonies.</p>

          <p>A review of Frances Wilson's new biography, "Electric Spark," re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer obscures her identity as a significant modern religious author. The article posits that Spark, a Catholic convert, used her novels to explore theological themes, particularly the relationship between an omniscient God and humanity, by playing with narrative form. Wilson's biography focuses on the fantastical and formative aspects of Spark's life, including her work in psychological warfare during WWII and a nervous breakdown, which deeply influenced her unique literary style and her obsession with themes of truth, fiction, and divine judgment.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist on TikTok has effectively debunked the common myth that current global warming is just part of the Earth's natural cycle. In a video, she acknowledges that while the Earth does have natural warming and cooling periods, the current rapid temperature increase is undeniably influenced by human emissions from burning fossil fuels. She presented charts from the EPA and other scientific institutions demonstrating that atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels are far higher than in any natural cycle. This accelerated warming is causing more extreme weather, threatening biodiversity, and is projected to have staggering economic costs.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Scottish politician Alex Salmond have dismissed claims made by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her upcoming memoir. Sturgeon suggested that Salmond himself might have been the "classic" source of a leak regarding a 2018 investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him. Kenny MacAskill, leader of the Alba party Salmond founded, called Sturgeon a "hypocrite," while others labeled the claim a "fabrication." The feud stems from a government probe into Salmond, which was later deemed unlawful, and his subsequent acquittal on all criminal charges, a series of events that fractured their once-formidable political partnership.</p>

The article notes the evolution of lighthouses, from their artistic immortalization by painters like Edward Hopper to their eventual automation.

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has apologized following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches, which are made by Indigenous artisans, but was reportedly produced in China without their involvement or credit. The issue drew condemnation, including from Mexico's president, for taking designs from Indigenous communities. In his apology, Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a "meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community," and promotional images of the footwear have since been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to invite Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska represents a significant gamble to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting is viewed with apprehension by Ukraine and European allies, who fear Trump may concede to Russian demands, such as redrawing Ukraine's borders, in his pursuit of a deal. The summit was arranged after Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, engaged in back-channel discussions and secured Putin's willingness to talk. While Trump hopes to broker peace, his history of skepticism toward Ukraine and deference to Putin creates uncertainty about the potential outcome of the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists unanimously advise that individuals with high blood pressure should never take licorice root supplements. The supplement contains glycyrrhizin, a compound that can dangerously raise blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium, straining the cardiovascular system. This warning extends to other forms of licorice, including teas and candies, as consuming even small amounts regularly can lead to serious health complications like arrhythmias. Instead of supplements, doctors recommend proven methods for managing blood pressure, such as following the DASH or Mediterranean diets, exercising regularly, and getting adequate sleep, and consulting a physician before starting any new supplement.</p>

A woman was killed when a large tree crushed a vehicle at Two Rivers state park, a popular camping area. The high winds also caused widespread damage, downing trees and power lines, and significantly damaging two housing units at the Nebraska state penitentiary in Lincoln. The damage forced the displacement and relocation of 387 inmates, though no injuries were reported among prisoners or staff. Other Midwestern states are also bracing for more severe weather.</p>

          <p>A review of Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the enduring literary trope of strange and mystical sisters who challenge societal norms. The novel, set in the 18th century, features five sisters accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, serving as a vehicle to explore why femininity is often perceived as a menace. The reviewer notes that literature has a long history of using sister groups, from Macbeth's weird sisters to the Bennet sisters, as a test for more central characters. While "The Hounding" sometimes states its themes too bluntly, it effectively uses the trope to question why female power is feared and persecuted.</p>
