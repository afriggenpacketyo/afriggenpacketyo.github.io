          <p>The 133-year-old company Kodak has issued a formal warning about its ability to continue operations, citing "substantial doubt" due to significant short-term debt and pension liabilities. This "going concern" warning, an accounting term signaling a risk of ceasing operations, caused the company's stock to plummet. Once a dominant force in photography, Kodak has struggled to adapt since the digital revolution and a 2012 bankruptcy, and it now faces a critical financial crunch despite efforts to pivot into new markets.

          <p>The Trump administration is using legal loopholes to keep controversial interim U.S. attorney appointees in their posts, sidestepping the traditional Senate confirmation process and, in some cases, defying federal judicial panels. In states like New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and California, appointees have faced resistance due to concerns about their political motivations and qualifications. Critics, including former federal judges, argue these actions represent a broader effort to undermine the justice system's independence and politicize federal law enforcement.</p>

This opposition comes as the Trump administration implements its crime plan in response to rising violence in the nation's capital, a move that has drawn criticism from Democratic leaders.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order demanding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) immediately improve conditions at a holding facility in Manhattan. The order responds to a lawsuit from detainees who described dirty, overcrowded rooms with open toilets, inedible food, and a lack of basic hygiene products. The judge mandated capacity limits, regular cleaning, and access to legal counsel, stating there was a "very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury" to those being held.</p>

This marks the second major transfer of its kind this year and is seen as a sign of continued collaboration between the two countries on security and drug trafficking issues. The move comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to take stronger action against organized crime, with the extradition serving as evidence of ongoing cooperation.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the Texas House, who left the state to prevent a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting plan, are now discussing their return. They consider their walkout a success in likely killing the first special session, though Governor Greg Abbott has promised to immediately call a second one with the same agenda. The proposed new maps would create five new Republican-majority congressional districts, a move Democrats call mid-decade gerrymandering, while Republicans argue it's a necessary response.</p>

          <p>While on a private holiday in the Cotswolds, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with senior Conservative shadow ministers Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp. The meeting was reportedly initiated by Vance's team and took place at the house where he is staying. This engagement with key opposition figures comes alongside other official and unofficial activities during his UK trip, including a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and a barbecue attended by other Conservative figures.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are studying the extensive use of electronic warfare in the Ukraine conflict, which they view as the first major electronic warfare engagement between major powers. The jamming and counter-jamming efforts by Russia and Western powers affected all major satellite navigation systems, including China's own Beidou system. This has provided a valuable real-world opportunity for Chinese scientists to observe vulnerabilities and develop countermeasures for their own military applications.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), conservative economist E.J. Antoni, has previously suggested suspending the agency's monthly jobs report. In a recent interview, Antoni questioned the report's reliability and proposed releasing only quarterly data until its accuracy could be fixed. This nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner over a jobs report he claimed was "rigged," fueling concerns among economists about the potential politicization of crucial economic data.

The water from Suicide Basin, which is dammed by the glacier, is flowing into the Mendenhall River, with water levels expected to reach record highs. This has become an annual event due to the thinning of the glacier, with officials warning that the impending flood could be the most severe one recorded to date.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic argues that a key aspect of Donald Trump's political strategy is forcing his opponents into dilemmas where all available options carry significant risks. From Democrats considering partisan gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, to officials weighing whether to defy presidential orders, these choices often pit short-term necessity against long-term democratic principles. This dynamic creates a constant state of crisis management for those who oppose him, demonstrating how he wields power by disrupting established norms.</p>

          <p>The White House is reframing the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska as a "listening exercise," a move seen as a response to concerns from European allies about a potential deal being made without Ukraine's input. European leaders fear that President Zelenskyy could be sidelined, and they are holding their own talks with the Ukrainian president ahead of the summit. This shift in tone suggests that diplomatic pressure may be influencing the U.S. approach, tempering initial expectations for a major breakthrough.</p>

Meanwhile, Russian troops have reportedly made a significant 10km advance near Dobropillia, which Zelenskyy characterized as an attempt by Moscow to create a narrative of momentum before the high-stakes meeting.</p>
