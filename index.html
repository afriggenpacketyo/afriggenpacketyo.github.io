          <p>A rare, one-of-a-kind rookie card for WNBA star Caitlin Clark has sold for a record $660,000 at auction, more than doubling the previous record for a women's sports card. The card features Clark's signature, a game-worn patch from her Indiana Fever uniform, and a handwritten note referencing her rookie scoring record. This sale highlights the massive commercial appeal and fandom that has followed the basketball phenom from her record-setting college career into the professional league. Clark, who is currently sidelined with a groin injury, continues to make a significant financial impact in the sports memorabilia market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees have addressed a significant need at third base by acquiring Ryan McMahon from the Colorado Rockies. The trade sends minor league pitchers Griffin Herring and Josh Grosz to the Rockies in exchange for the veteran infielder. While McMahon's batting average this season is modest, his recent performance shows improvement and his overall OPS is an upgrade for the Yankees at the position. More importantly, McMahon is recognized for his excellent defensive skills, which will immediately bolster the team's infield as they make a push for the postseason.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing a major regulatory hurdle for the $8.4 billion deal. The approval came with commitments from Skydance to ensure viewpoint diversity in programming and to hire a CBS News ombudsman. The decision was not unanimous, with the lone Democratic commissioner dissenting, citing concerns over a recent $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Donald Trump. The merger, expected to close in early August, concludes a lengthy and complex sale process for the major media conglomerate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legal experts and multiple former federal prosecutors have described the Justice Department's direct interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell as highly unorthodox and concerning. They question the decision for Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to personally conduct the interview, rather than the line prosecutors who handled her case. Experts noted that such a high-level official's involvement breaks with standard procedure and raises questions about the credibility of any information Maxwell might provide, given her likely desperation for a reduced sentence. The unusual circumstances have led to speculation that the move is more political than a standard investigative effort.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. While the White House plans to appeal, this ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy on this contentious issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strategy of establishing a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on foreign goods is expected to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers, according to economists. Despite White House claims that foreign exporters will bear the cost, major companies like Nestlé and General Electric have indicated they may raise prices to offset increased tariff-related expenses. While the impact has been gradual, experts predict that prices for imported goods such as electronics and apparel will noticeably increase in the latter half of the year. An analysis from the Yale Budget Lab projects the new tariff regime could drive up U.S. prices by 2% over two years. (not investment advice)</p>
