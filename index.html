          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon women's final victory, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive match that concluded in under one hour. The 24-year-old Polish player won in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0, marking the first time in 114 years a player failed to win a single game in the women's final. This victory represents Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title overall, adding a grass-court championship to her previous wins on clay and hard courts. For Anisimova, this was her first Grand Slam final appearance after taking a career break in 2023.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of last week's deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, dozens of active and former Navy SEALs have joined the search and recovery efforts. The volunteers are using their specialized skills to navigate the difficult, debris-filled terrain and dive in the Guadalupe River to locate victims. The effort, coordinated with the non-profit 300 Justice Road, aims to provide closure for the families of the missing. Former SEAL Greg Froelick described the scene as unlike anything he had ever witnessed, noting the emotional difficulty of the task.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intensified his long-standing feud with comedian Rosie O'Donnell, suggesting on social media that he is considering revoking her U.S. citizenship. Trump referred to O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland earlier this year, as a "Threat to Humanity." O'Donnell responded on her own social media, calling Trump a "criminal con man" and a "danger to our nation." The article notes that legal experts agree the government cannot unilaterally revoke the citizenship of a natural-born citizen like O'Donnell.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Eastpoint, Florida, led investigators to uncover a volatile three-person relationship, or "throuple," involving Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. After Seiden's body was discovered, evidence from a blood-soaked motel room and witness testimony pointed to a violent confrontation fueled by alcohol and jealousy. Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, describing a brutal beating that included a sexual assault. Abell was ultimately convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for his role in Seiden's death.</p>

          <p>Federal agents arrested 319 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two California cannabis farms, an operation that resulted in tense protests and one worker's death. The Department of Homeland Security stated agents were executing criminal search warrants related to harboring and illegal employment. During the raid in Camarillo, a farm worker was fatally injured after falling from a greenhouse roof, though DHS claimed he was not being pursued. The raids and subsequent clashes have heightened fear in immigrant communities and led to a temporary judicial halt on such operations in Southern California.</p>

Recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the aircraft, leading to reports that Boeing is considering resuming production.

          <p>Britain's struggling steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Redcar, are facing increased anxiety due to the ongoing uncertainty over U.S. tariffs on steel exports. The industry, already in a long decline from its peak in the 1970s, has been hit hard by plant closures, job losses, and high energy prices. While a 25% U.S. tariff remains, the threat of further increases adds to a sense of foreboding, costing the UK industry orders. This article explores the personal stories of laid-off workers and the broader debate over whether these towns should fight to preserve their industrial past or pivot to new industries.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign from his position. Speculation arose following reports of a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's decision not to release further files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The decision frustrated some hardline Trump supporters who had been promised significant revelations. In a social media post, Patel stated the "conspiracy theories just aren’t true" and that he would continue to serve as director, seeking to quell reports of a major rift within the administration's top law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to the vast Rubaya mining site in eastern DR Congo, which is a critical source of the world's coltan and is currently controlled by M23 rebels. The report details the lives of thousands of miners working in the pits, which hold 15% of the global coltan supply used in mobile phones. An M23-appointed supervisor claims the group has brought security and order to the site. The visit comes after a US-brokered ceasefire deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, with the US reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region as part of the agreement.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining ratings, the reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, largely attributed to its massive engagement on TikTok.

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas during the Fourth of July weekend have killed at least 129 people, with dozens still missing. The disaster, described as a "100-year flood," was caused by a confluence of weather systems that dumped massive amounts of rain over a flood-prone area. Among the victims were at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, a summer camp for girls. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, with survivors stating they received no alerts before the deluge hit.</p>

The grave's existence was brought to light by local historian Catherine Corliss, and a 2017 test dig confirmed "significant quantities of human remains."

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, ordering officials to stop "indiscriminately" detaining people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong's order stems from a lawsuit by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained without reasonable suspicion. The ruling bars officials from making arrests based solely on race, language, or presence at a specific location, and prohibits them from denying access to lawyers. The decision comes amid a ramp-up in immigration enforcement and protests against raids in the region.</p>
