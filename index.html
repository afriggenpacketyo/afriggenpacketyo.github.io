          <p>The United States has seen record sales of all-electric vehicles in the first nine months of the year, surpassing one million units for the first time. This surge was largely driven by consumers rushing to purchase EVs before the expiration of federal incentives worth up to $7,500. Tesla maintained its market leadership, though its share has decreased, while General Motors experienced significant growth, becoming the second-largest EV seller. Industry analysts anticipate a potential slowdown in sales now that the federal credits have ended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During Sean Combs' sentencing hearing, Judge Arun Subramanian stated that the music mogul has not shown remorse or taken full responsibility for his actions. Combs was previously found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. The judge indicated he would consider conduct for which Combs was acquitted as relevant context for the sentencing, particularly regarding coercion. Prosecutors argued against allowing numerous character witnesses, while Combs' children and pastor were permitted to speak on his behalf.</p>

The rabbi praised the heroism of those present, stating that their quick actions to lock the doors prevented a much larger tragedy, as hundreds more people were expected to arrive for the service.</p>

The platform will initially offer trading and custody for bitcoin and ether, facilitated by the startup Zerohash. This move positions OnePay to compete with other major digital finance apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto services. The integration aims to expand OnePay's offerings as it builds an "everything app" for finance, leveraging its connection to Walmart's vast customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A slowing U.S. labor market is leading to a rise in long-term unemployment, with the share of people jobless for 27 weeks or more reaching its highest point in over three years. Workers, including experienced professionals, report applying for hundreds of jobs with little success, forcing them to deplete savings and retirement funds. Economists note that employers are in a "low-hire, low-fire" environment, making it difficult for new entrants to find positions. This trend poses risks to both individual financial stability and the broader economy if discouraged workers exit the labor force entirely.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a partisan speech to approximately 800 senior military leaders at Quantico, Virginia, raising concerns about the politicization of the armed forces. Accompanied by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump criticized "woke" military policies and suggested using the military for police actions in major U.S. cities, calling them "training grounds." While some insiders were relieved that the event did not involve loyalty pledges or an immediate purge of generals, critics viewed it as using the military as a political backdrop. The speech underscored the administration's focus on domestic military roles over foreign deployments.</p>

He attributed the risk to the intense investor excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Solomon noted that while new technologies create opportunities, markets often run ahead of their actual potential, leading to an eventual correction where deployed capital fails to deliver returns. He clarified he wasn't necessarily calling it a "bubble" but emphasized that a market reset is likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's twelfth album, "The Life of a Showgirl," is being analyzed as a definitive statement on her relationship with fame and ambition. The article suggests that after years of balancing a "nice girl" persona with intense professional drive, Swift is now openly acknowledging her satisfaction with her career, despite its challenges. The album's title track concludes with the line "I wouldn’t have it any other way," signaling a shift from portraying fame as a burden to embracing it fully. This move is seen as particularly significant in a cultural moment marked by anti-feminist backlash against ambitious women.</p>

The article notes that the German midfielder has not yet fully adapted to the physical intensity of the Premier League, which affects his on-the-ball actions. To get the best out of Wirtz, Liverpool may need to adjust their system to allow him more opportunities in transition and with space to drive at defenders.</p>

          <p>Phil Rosenthal, creator of "Everybody Loves Raymond" and host of the Netflix travel series "Somebody Feed Phil," is opening a new diner in Los Angeles named Max and Helen's. The restaurant is named in honor of his late parents, who were beloved figures on his show. The menu will feature comfort food classics, including his father's favorite dish, fluffy scrambled eggs. Rosenthal aims for the diner to become a community hub, preserving a type of neighborhood gathering place that he feels is disappearing from America.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding designated for two major Chicago transit system improvement projects. The Department of Transportation cited the ongoing government shutdown, which it blamed on Democratic leaders, as a reason for delaying a review of the projects for "unconstitutional practices" related to race-based contracting. This action follows similar funding freezes for projects in New York and the cancellation of climate-related funds for states won by the Democratic presidential nominee. Critics see these moves as politically motivated actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a top scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has been fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her dismissal comes just three weeks after she filed a whistleblower complaint alleging her previous demotion was retaliation for protesting the Trump administration's efforts to undermine vaccine research. Marrazzo's complaint also claimed that officials were politicizing grant decisions and ignoring court orders. Her firing is part of a broader series of dismissals and budget cuts across the Department of Health and Human Services under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock, an application that uses crowdsourced data to track the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from its App Store. The app's developer claimed the removal was due to pressure from the Trump administration, while Apple stated it acted based on information from law enforcement about safety risks. The app, which had over one million downloads, was designed to help migrants avoid arrest. Law enforcement officials have previously argued that such apps could be used to ambush agents and impede their operations.</p>

He also strongly defended the rights of migrants and refugees and criticized the Labour Party for, in his view, echoing the positions of Reform UK on immigration.</p>

          <p>A weakening U.S. labor market is disproportionately affecting recent college graduates, for whom a bachelor's degree is no longer guaranteeing access to white-collar jobs. Federal data shows the unemployment rate for new entrants into the workforce has reached a nine-year high, with the gap between unemployment for degree holders and high school graduates narrowing significantly. This trend is attributed to a glut of graduates, a "low-hiring" environment, and potential automation of entry-level roles by AI. As a result, many young graduates are struggling with prolonged job searches and moving back in with their parents.</p>

          <p>Seven people from Kenya have successfully won a legal case in a London Family Court, proving they were fathered by British men who were stationed at an army base in their country. The landmark case utilized commercially available DNA databases to identify the fathers, six of whom had served at the British Army Training Unit in Kenya. This ruling is the first of its kind in a UK court and paves the way for the offspring to apply for British citizenship. The case brings to light the long-term consequences for local communities near the major British army base.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos described the current excitement around artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," but one that is based on real technology that will ultimately provide "gigantic" benefits to society. Speaking at an event, he noted that during such bubbles, both good and bad ideas receive funding, and stock prices can become disconnected from fundamentals. However, he argued that unlike purely financial bubbles, industrial ones can be beneficial because even after many companies fail, the successful innovations that emerge leave society better off.

Tuchel emphasized the need for the team to be able to perform without relying on one individual, especially with the World Cup approaching. The move also rewards other players who impressed during England's recent 5-0 victory over Serbia.</p>
