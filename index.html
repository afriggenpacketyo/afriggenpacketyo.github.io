          <p>Fast-fashion retailer Shein has removed a product listing and launched an investigation after an image of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering a UnitedHealthcare CEO, was used to model a shirt. The company stated the image was provided by a third-party vendor and was taken down immediately upon discovery, adding that it has stringent standards and will take action against the vendor. It remains unclear how the image was created or for how long it was on the site, with some speculating it was generated by AI. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges, and his case has attracted significant social media attention.</p>

The event, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, served as a powerful display of unity among the three leaders, who are often at odds with the West. Xi delivered a speech emphasizing that the world faces a choice between peace and war, while the parade featured new technologies like laser weapons and robotic drones.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed changes to English cricket's County Championship, originally planned for 2026, may be delayed until 2027 or scrapped entirely due to a lack of consensus among the 18 first-class counties. While a reduction in the T20 Blast was agreed upon, proposals to cut the Championship from 14 to 12 matches were rejected. The current debate centers on whether to maintain the 14-game season or adopt a 13-game structure with a revised divisional format. The difficulty in reaching an agreement has raised the possibility of postponing any structural changes to ensure the best decision is made for the domestic game.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the advanced weapons showcased at China's recent Victory Day parade indicate a strong focus on safeguarding its sovereignty, particularly concerning Taiwan. Although President Xi Jinping did not mention Taiwan in his speech, the display of cutting-edge military hardware is interpreted as a clear signal of the People's Liberation Army's growing capabilities. Xi urged the military to accelerate its development to protect national reunification and territorial integrity. Beijing views Taiwan as a territory to be reunified, by force if necessary, and the parade's focus on military modernization underscores this strategic priority.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has urged the government to clarify laws regarding online speech following the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan.

          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 6% after a U.S. district judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in its antitrust case against Google. The ruling means Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system, which investors viewed as a major victory for the company. While found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, Google can still make payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, though exclusive contracts are now barred. This outcome removes a significant overhang on the stock and is seen as reinforcing the long-term durability of Google's core search business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the evolution of how children have been depicted in art, from religious icons in the Middle Ages to symbols of dynastic ambition and, eventually, subjects of personal affection. Initially, art featured children primarily as religious figures like Jesus or as cherubs, before royalty began commissioning portraits to showcase their heirs for political marriages. As the bourgeoisie rose, they emulated this practice, often dressing their children in idealized costumes. The concept of a modern, unburdened childhood only emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to more spontaneous and playful depictions that continue to evolve with photography and social media.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have dropped a theft charge against a man accused of taking flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham. The court was informed that a security guard had given the 45-year-old man permission to take the flowers, leading the Crown Prosecution Service to conclude there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. The case arose in August after reports of a theft from the thousands of tributes left for the Black Sabbath singer, who passed away in July. The man was told he was free to go after a brief court hearing.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest aerial attacks of the war, firing more than 500 drones and 24 missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to Ukrainian officials. The massive barrage targeted civilian and energy infrastructure across the country, with explosions reported in western regions and at least one person killed in Khmelnytskyi. Ukraine's air force reported downing or suppressing a majority of the projectiles, but dozens of impacts were recorded. The scale of the attack prompted NATO aircraft in neighboring Poland to scramble as a precautionary measure, highlighting the escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has spoken about his return to the England national team after an absence of nearly seven years, stating he had "completely forgot" about playing for his country. The 29-year-old's last appearance was in 2018, before a severe Achilles rupture in 2019 derailed his career and international prospects. After rebuilding his form at AC Milan, he has been recalled by England manager Thomas Tuchel, with whom he worked at Chelsea. Loftus-Cheek said he had become accustomed to being just a fan of the team and credited his self-belief for overcoming the significant challenges of his recovery.</p>

          <p>As increasingly intense heatwaves affect the U.S., school districts are facing a new challenge: managing dangerously hot conditions in buildings often ill-equipped for modern temperatures. Many schools are shortening days or delaying openings, sparking a debate about long-term solutions, including infrastructure upgrades like modern HVAC systems and even a radical rethinking of the traditional school calendar. Some experts suggest that if schools can be made cool enough, they could serve as safe havens during extreme summer heat, potentially making a fall or spring break more sensible than a long summer vacation where many children lack air conditioning at home.</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging first half, Morgan Stanley analysts predict that China's property market is poised for a pickup in the latter half of the year. The report suggests that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow significantly, with a potential for sales to increase in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on factors such as a large stock of available homes in major cities and the anticipated start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-cut cycle. Developers have also provided positive guidance, expecting a recovery in profit margins and rental income growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic Party's strategy of aligning closely with organized labor has failed to reverse its declining support among working-class voters. Despite President Biden's administration being staunchly pro-union, these voters continued to drift away, suggesting their decisions are now more influenced by cultural issues than economic ones. The author contends that unconditional deference to union demands can lead to policies that increase the cost of living, such as trade tariffs and restrictive building rules, thereby undermining the party's goal of appealing to blue-collar workers. A more balanced approach that weighs union interests against the broader public good is proposed.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is facing concerns over severely low attendance at the Rose Bowl, with figures potentially being inflated in official announcements. For the recent season opener, the announced attendance was 35,032, but internal scan counts showed only 27,785 people were actually in the stadium. This article reveals that such discrepancies are common, with one 2022 game having a scan count less than half of the announced figure. This trend of empty seats reflects a significant drop in fan engagement and ticket revenue, posing a major challenge for the athletic department as it competes in an increasingly crowded Los Angeles sports market.</p>

Citing the coaching brilliance of Sean McVay and a relatively weak schedule, the piece projects the Rams will win at least 11 games. The argument is framed by the team's strong finish last season, where they narrowly lost to the eventual champions in a close playoff game.</p>
