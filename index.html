          <p>According to a U.S. government complaint, scammers created phony email addresses to impersonate the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, successfully tricking donors into sending over $250,000 in cryptocurrency. The perpetrators used deceptive email domains to solicit what victims believed were legitimate donations, with one email appearing to be from committee co-chair Steve Witkoff. The U.S. is now seeking to permanently seize nearly $40,400 of the recovered funds to deter future criminal activity and compensate victims. A portion of the stolen crypto was traced to a Binance account in Nigeria.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which references a villainous Jewish moneylender from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," was used to describe predatory bankers. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that words from leaders matter.

          <p>Germany has approved a significant increase in national defense spending, aiming to modernize its armed forces in response to geopolitical shifts, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the arms industry is experiencing a boom, economists are skeptical about broader economic benefits, suggesting defense spending yields a lower return on investment compared to infrastructure or education. Critics warn that the spending may inflate arms companies' profits more than bolster defense capabilities, as the manufactured goods do not create additional economic value like other public investments. The article notes this spending is unlikely to generate significant overall growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these successes, Cape Verde still faces challenges, including youth unemployment and migration, with about 6% of its young population leaving between 2009 and 2021.

          <p>A 90-day pause on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new trade agreements are not finalized, a baseline 10% duty on all imports will be supplemented by higher, country-specific reciprocal rates. The Trump administration has announced deals with China, the U.K., and Vietnam but has been quiet on dozens of other nations. Economists warn the new tariffs could fuel inflation and harm financial markets, while some experts believe the administration may extend the deadline for countries negotiating in good faith.

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton concluded his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata in just 70 seconds, a day after it was controversially suspended due to fading light. Shelton was serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set when play was halted, prompting frustration from the player and jeers from the crowd. Returning to the court on Friday, he quickly fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to seal the victory. Shelton, who found humor in the situation afterward, will now face Marton Fucsovics in the third round.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through the country, is a direct effort to counter Chinese manufacturers evading U.S. tariffs. However, the pact's vague details have raised questions about its implementation, particularly how "made in Vietnam" will be defined and enforced. Economists note that the impact could range from minimal to highly disruptive for Vietnam's economy, depending on whether the tariff targets only pure transshipments or all goods with Chinese components. The move signals a broader U.S. strategy to pressure China through trade negotiations with third countries. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's primary demographic is young adults, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's significant and growing overseas revenue, which is projected to soon account for over half of its sales, provides a cushion against domestic regulatory pressures. While the company faces challenges like scalping and production delays, its strong brand and international expansion are expected to sustain its growth.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws a parallel between the British imposition of martial law on Boston in the 1770s and the potential for military overreach in modern domestic affairs. The author argues that while the Stamp Act ignited conflict, it was the Coercive Acts of 1774—which dissolved local government and installed a military governor—that transformed resistance into revolution. This escalation, culminating in the Boston Massacre and the battles of Lexington and Concord, serves as a historical warning. The article suggests that deploying troops on domestic streets provokes tension and can lead to unintended violence and lasting civil discord.</p>

This idea of U.S.-China collaboration on industrial reinvigoration comes during a period of de-escalated trade tensions.

Archaeologists analyzed thousands of bone fragments and tools, concluding that the ancient humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutritious marrow and fat. This process, likely done to avoid protein poisoning from a lean meat diet, suggests Neanderthals possessed sophisticated planning, organization, and survival skills. The finding adds to a growing body of evidence challenging the outdated stereotype of Neanderthals as unintelligent, showing they had a refined understanding of nutrition and resource management.</p>
