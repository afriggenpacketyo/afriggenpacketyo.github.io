          <p>UK newspaper headlines are focusing on dual crises facing the government. The Daily Mail reports Health Secretary Wes Streeting is taking a firm stance against striking junior doctors, whose five-day walkout he claims endangers the NHS. Concurrently, publications like the Daily Mirror and The Guardian are highlighting the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, featuring distressing images of starving Palestinians. A foreign affairs committee is urging the UK to increase efforts to alleviate the suffering, while there is also growing pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting to address escalating border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. The conflict, centered on a long-standing territorial dispute near ancient temples, has intensified with both nations accusing the other of initiating hostilities. Reports indicate Cambodia has used rockets, while Thailand has deployed F-16 jets for cross-border strikes. The fighting has resulted in casualties and the evacuation of over 100,000 Thai civilians from border provinces, prompting international calls for de-escalation from China, the US, and the EU.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 00:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college athletics, particularly concerning athlete compensation and the protection of non-revenue sports. The order directs federal agencies to enforce new rules on scholarships for women's and Olympic sports and seeks to control name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals that are not based on fair market value. This move comes after a legal settlement allowed universities to directly pay players, raising concerns that revenue-generating sports like football and basketball would overshadow other athletic programs. The order's legality is being questioned by experts, but it signals significant federal intervention in collegiate sports.</p>

          <p>In China, there are growing calls for a thorough investigation and improved safety protocols following the deaths of six engineering students in a mine accident. The students from Northeastern University were on a field trip at a copper-molybdenum mine in Inner Mongolia when a grating panel reportedly collapsed, causing them to fall into an industrial flotation tank. A teacher was also injured in the incident. The Inner Mongolia regional government has established an accident investigation team to determine the cause and recommend corrective actions as media outlets report emerging details of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is traveling to Scotland for the opening of a new family-owned golf course, a trip that critics argue blurs the lines between his official duties and private business interests. During the visit, Trump is scheduled to discuss trade with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, potentially at a Trump property. The use of presidential resources, such as Air Force One and a large support staff, for a trip that promotes a Trump-branded enterprise has drawn scrutiny from ethics watchdogs. The White House defended the trip as a working visit, asserting that the president's business acumen is part of his political appeal.</p>

FCC head Brendan Carr stated he welcomed Skydance's commitment to unbiased journalism, which includes installing an ombudsman to review bias complaints. The deal transfers ownership of major assets like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and MTV to Skydance, which has also pledged to end diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has made a groundbreaking discovery by directly observing quantum friction between solid materials for the first time. Using folded graphene, the scientists found that, contrary to classical physics, friction did not always increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily. This unexpected effect is attributed to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which limits the conversion of motion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear.</p>

          <p>Hulk Hogan, the iconic professional wrestler whose real name was Terry Bollea, has died at the age of 71 following a cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida. Hogan was a transformative figure in entertainment, catapulting the WWE to global fame in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona and becoming one of pop culture's most recognizable figures. He was a six-time WWE champion and a key draw for the inaugural WrestleMania. His death has prompted widespread condolences, including from President Trump, who remembered him as a great friend and a cultural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Immigrants deported from the U.S. are facing significant challenges as they try to build new lives in unfamiliar circumstances in Mexico. Many, like Juan Carlos who lived in the U.S. for 19 years, are sent to border cities like Tijuana with the help of nonprofit organizations. However, resources are not available everywhere, and some deportees are flown to other parts of Mexico. The Trump administration is on track for over 300,000 removals in its first year, but this is below its target of one million. Some immigrants are even choosing to self-deport to avoid being sent to a third country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans is set to close more than 100 of its 200-plus branches across the UK and Ireland over the next decade. The charity's CEO stated that maintaining so many physical locations is not sustainable and hinders service delivery. The plan, which has caused concern among dozens of branches, involves moving towards fewer, larger regional hubs and introducing "virtual volunteering" from home. Some volunteers fear this will dismantle the supportive, in-person community that has been effective for 70 years and may lead to an exodus of volunteers, particularly women concerned about handling abusive calls alone.</p>

          <p>The UN's Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) has issued a dire warning that one in five children in Gaza City is now malnourished, with cases rising daily. UNRWA's Commissioner-General described people in Gaza as "walking corpses" and stated over 100 people, mostly children, have reportedly died from hunger. The World Health Organization has described the situation as man-made mass starvation. Despite Israel's claims that there is no siege, the UN and over 100 aid organizations report that aid is only a trickle, and they are pressing for unrestricted humanitarian access to prevent further catastrophe.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council and the Washington Commanders have reached an amended agreement for a new stadium at the RFK site, moving the team closer to returning to the district. The deal was announced despite President Trump's recent threat to block it unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name, a comment the council chairman called an unhelpful distraction. The amended proposal includes $950 million in revenue benefits for D.C. and is set for a council vote on August 1. The deal still faces challenges, including the formal transfer of the federally-owned land to the city. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death of Hulk Hogan has prompted reflection on his profound and often controversial impact on modern popular culture. As both a patriotic hero and a villainous "heel," Hogan pioneered the brand of self-spun celebrity that transformed professional wrestling into a global phenomenon and set the template for reality television. His career mirrored and catalyzed major cultural shifts, from his in-your-face persona challenging 1980s norms to his successful lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker Media, raising questions about press freedom. Despite scandals involving racism and steroids, Hogan's influence on entertainment, celebrity branding, and even political theater remains undeniable.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by email are speaking out, calling their dismissals an "attack on the rule of law." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases in Chicago and Boston, claim they were terminated without cause or explanation. They also allege they were pressured by the administration on how to rule in certain cases to facilitate easier apprehension of immigrants by ICE agents outside the courtroom. Their firings come as the immigration court system faces a backlog of nearly four million cases, and the judges' union reports over 100 judges have been fired or have left since the administration took office.</p>
