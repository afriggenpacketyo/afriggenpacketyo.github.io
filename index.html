          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the Department of Government Efficiency initiative. Judge Susan Illston ruled that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force that disregard congressional mandates. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that presidents have the authority to set policy priorities for the executive branch, but the judge sided with the argument that congress's power to fund agencies must be respected.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States or face tariffs, a challenge given the company's established supply chain in Asia. While Apple could theoretically produce iPhones in the U.S., experts say it would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling prices due to higher labor costs and automation needs. The article notes that Apple has shifted some production to India to avoid tariffs and leverage the country's growing engineering talent, but remains heavily reliant on China for complex components and skilled labor.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Trump in two cases concerning his power to fire members of independent agencies, signaling a potential shift in executive power. The court's decision, made through an emergency order, suggests a view that independent agencies are likely unconstitutional and that the president must have control over officials who exercise executive power. However, the court also indicated that the Federal Reserve is different, suggesting monetary policy may not necessarily be executive power, which could preserve some independence for the Fed.</p>

Concerns are also raised about provisions allowing polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee, and that the bill may put up to 330,000 jobs at risk.</p>

Despite facing criticism from some Western critics, Grigorovich was considered a genius by many Russian critics and reshaped the Bolshoi Ballet during his tenure.

The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 3 basis points to 5.03%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 5 basis points to 4.505%. Trump's proposals for tariffs on EU goods and Apple iPhones have triggered market uncertainty and a flight to safety in bonds.
