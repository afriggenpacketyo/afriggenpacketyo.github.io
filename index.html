          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis follows Biden reporting urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade illness, but it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. This news comes after Biden withdrew from the 2024 election due to health and age concerns, facing criticism after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump.</p>
