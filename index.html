          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive performance contrasted with broader downturns across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were affected by concerns originating from the U.S. banking sector and trade tensions. While markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Japan saw significant declines, the resilience of the Kospi highlights investor confidence in the potential outcomes of the trade discussions. The broader regional weakness followed a sell-off on Wall Street fueled by fears over bad loans held by some U.S. regional banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a phone call, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The renewed diplomatic effort comes after a ceasefire was achieved in the Middle East, allowing the administration to refocus on the European conflict. As a form of leverage, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic President Trump plans to discuss with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Kremlin has expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue but remains cautious, while analysts speculate this could be a pivotal moment to increase pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection designed to prevent HIV, known as cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales. This development brings the policy in line with Scotland and offers an alternative to daily pills for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The injection, administered every other month, is intended for individuals at high risk of acquiring HIV for whom daily oral medication is not a practical option. Health experts are hopeful that this new method will be a significant step toward the goal of eliminating new HIV cases in the UK by 2030, providing a more convenient and discreet prevention tool.</p>

          <p>China has initiated military drills in the South China Sea near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, according to a notice from its Maritime Safety Administration. The timing of these exercises is notable, as they commenced on the final day of joint naval exercises conducted by the United States and the Philippines. The U.S.-Philippine war games, which also included participation from Japan, Canada, and France, were designed to enhance joint maritime defense capabilities. This development occurs amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Manila over contested territories in the resource-rich waterway, heightening concerns about the potential for a wider conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a growing political crusade against objective truth is undermining the work of fact-checking organizations. It highlights that major tech companies like Google and Meta are pulling funding from groups such as Full Fact and replacing their services with algorithm-based "community notes," which risks prioritizing consensus over verifiable evidence. The author contends that this shift, influenced by a political narrative that frames fact-checking as censorship, represents a dangerous departure from Enlightenment values that prioritize reason and evidence. The piece concludes by emphasizing the critical role of independent fact-checkers in maintaining a healthy public discourse grounded in reality.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the immense pressure facing 18-year-old basketball prodigy Cooper Flagg as he enters the NBA with the Dallas Mavericks. The article frames his arrival within the historical context of the "Great White Hope" narrative in American sports, a mythos born from a desire to find a white champion in predominantly Black leagues. Flagg, an exceptionally talented two-way player from Maine, joins a Mavericks franchise historically defined by white superstars like Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Dončić. He must navigate not only the on-court challenge of leading a team but also the complex racial and cultural expectations that have been projected onto him.</p>

          <p>European financial markets experienced a significant downturn as concerns from the U.S. banking sector spread across the Atlantic. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell, with banking stocks leading the decline after shares of U.S. regional banks and investment firm Jefferies tumbled due to fears of bad loans. Major European indices in the U.K., France, and Germany all traded in negative territory. The sell-off also impacted defense stocks following the announcement of a meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents to discuss the war in Ukraine. This marks a notable reversal for the banking and defense sectors, which had been strong performers throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Maryland has indicted former Trump national security adviser John Bolton on charges of unlawfully transmitting and retaining classified national defense information. The indictment alleges that Bolton used a personal email account to send at least eight classified documents to unauthorized individuals, identified as his relatives, and improperly stored sensitive materials at his home. Prosecutors also claim that a cyber actor associated with Iran later hacked Bolton's personal email, gaining access to the classified information. Bolton has denied any wrongdoing, stating the charges are part of a pattern of political retribution and that he looks forward to defending his conduct.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order that prevents the president from deploying National Guard troops within Illinois. The three-judge panel for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the administration was unlikely to prove a "rebellion" exists that would justify such a deployment under federal law. The court's decision stated that political opposition and protests against federal immigration policies do not constitute a rebellion. The ruling maintains a temporary restraining order, keeping control of the Guard troops with the state and blocking their federalized deployment for crime prevention or protection of immigration facilities.</p>

The takeover occurred after weeks of youth-led protests against chronic poverty, as well as electricity and water shortages.

The African Union has suspended Madagascar's membership in response to the coup, which both it and the United Nations have condemned.

However, the company's chairman stated that China's dominance keeps prices artificially low, making UK refining uneconomic without substantial government support, which was not sufficiently provided.

To adapt, pubs are improving their food and coffee offerings and creating more comfortable environments to attract a broader customer base.

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has expressed skepticism about Marcus Rashford's recent claim that an "inconsistent environment" at the club was to blame for his performance issues. Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona, suggested the atmosphere at United had been challenging for a long time. However, Rooney countered that it is easy to blame the environment when not playing well and that a player's own application is a key factor. Rooney pointed to games where Rashford could have shown more effort, stating that such aspects of performance are not related to the club's environment.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine Corps pilot, is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States, where he faces charges for allegedly training Chinese military pilots over a decade ago. A 2016 U.S. indictment accuses Duggan of conspiring to provide training in 2010 and 2012 without the required license. Duggan, who denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated, has been held in a maximum-security prison since his arrest in 2022. His lawyers are arguing that there were legal flaws in the extradition process approved by Australia's former attorney-general, as Duggan was an Australian citizen when the alleged training occurred.</p>

          <p>Analysts have raised concerns that Japan's current turbulent and fragmented political landscape could undermine its diplomatic commitments and stall progress in trilateral relations with China and South Korea. As the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) navigates a complex leadership contest, no single party appears able to form a stable government on its own. This instability is expected to weaken Japan's ability to engage effectively in major diplomatic events. Regardless of who becomes the next prime minister, the need to build and maintain fragile coalitions could hinder decisive action on key foreign policy issues, including the trilateral framework with its regional neighbors.</p>
