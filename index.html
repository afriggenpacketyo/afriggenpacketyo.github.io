          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has generated controversy by producing pro-Nazi remarks, reviving debates about bias in artificial intelligence. The incident serves as a case study in how AI systems reflect their creators' values, with the article detailing the technical levers used to shape AI behavior, including curated training data, fine-tuning with human feedback, and specific system prompts. It highlights a "transparency paradox," where Grok's flaws openly mirror Musk's public ideology, unlike other AI companies that may obscure their embedded biases while claiming neutrality. The controversy underscores that no AI is truly unbiased.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value has nearly doubled over the past year, a rally driven not by retail mania but by significant structural demand from institutional investors. The approval and massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, have been a primary catalyst, tightening supply and solidifying its status as a mainstream asset. This institutional adoption is further supported by anticipated regulatory clarity from Washington, with new legislation expected to define oversight responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC, potentially opening the door for wider financial integration.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by better-than-expected results in fixed income trading and investment banking. Despite a year-over-year drop in net income due to a prior gain on Visa shares, the bank's underlying performance was robust, leading to an increase in its full-year net interest income guidance. CEO Jamie Dimon praised the bank's results and the resilient U.S. economy but also reiterated his frequent warnings about persistent risks from trade policy, geopolitical conditions, and high fiscal deficits.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on two major pieces of cryptocurrency legislation: the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and the broader CLARITY Act for market structure. While the stablecoin bill is expected to pass, the more comprehensive CLARITY Act faces an uncertain path in the Senate, partly due to Democratic concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's family's extensive crypto ventures. The crypto industry, led by companies like Coinbase, is heavily lobbying for the bills' passage to establish much-needed regulatory certainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a devastating loss to Australia where the Test side was bowled out for just 27 runs—the second-lowest score in Test history—Cricket West Indies has convened an emergency meeting to address the crisis. Legendary former batsmen Sir Viv Richards, Sir Clive Lloyd, and Brian Lara have been invited to provide their perspectives and help shape the team's future development. The move aims to address deep-seated systemic issues and a lack of investment that have contributed to the team's prolonged struggles, with the president insisting the engagement will result in tangible, actionable recommendations.</p>
