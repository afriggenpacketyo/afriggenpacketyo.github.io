          <p>The Federal Reserve is maintaining its current policy on interest rates, choosing to wait and observe the effects of President Trump's tariffs and various economic indicators. With mixed signals coming from the economy and unresolved trade policy questions, the Fed prefers to delay any action until there is more clarity on inflation expectations and the actual implementation of trade deals. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address these uncertainties in a post-meeting news conference, emphasizing that all options are on the table for future meetings. The Fed is facing a challenging balancing act between managing inflation and supporting economic growth amidst volatile financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving the White House, former President Biden criticized President Trumpâ€™s handling of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies. Speaking to the BBC, Biden attacked Trumpâ€™s management of foreign policy, including his combative meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine. Biden defended the timing of his own withdrawal from the 2024 presidential campaign, despite polling data indicating that many Democrats did not want him to run for a second term. Biden's re-emergence into the public sphere suggests he intends to continue playing a role in the Democratic party, despite some within the party blaming him for their 2024 defeat.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts Ph.D. student, from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. This order supports a lower court ruling requiring the transfer, which aims to provide her access to legal and medical services. Ozturk was arrested after her student visa was revoked, with the Department of Homeland Security citing her involvement in associations that may undermine U.S. foreign policy.

          <p>An opinion article in The New York Times discusses the political challenges Republicans face due to President Trump's tariffs and proposed tax cuts. The author, Brendan Buck, argues that extending the 2017 tax law may not provide the economic boost Republicans hope for, especially with the economic damage caused by Trump's tariffs. Buck suggests that Republicans should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to avoid jeopardizing their congressional majorities. The article suggests that Republicans need to persuade voters that they are working on the cost of living and creating a humming economy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, including those focused on climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). An internal agency document indicates that these cuts could save $26 million by canceling grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. Programs such as Scientists in Parks, climate resiliency studies, and projects supporting disabled children and LGBTQ history are targeted.

This statement was made during a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet, focusing on Google's practice of paying platform providers like Apple to be the default search engine. Cue also noted that searches on Safari declined for the first time in April, which he attributed to the rise of people using AI.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for a North Carolina Supreme Court race, has conceded the election to Allison Riggs after contesting the results for over six months. Griffin's efforts to overturn his narrow loss involved challenging thousands of votes and questioning the eligibility of certain voters. A federal judge ultimately blocked a state court ruling that would have required some voters to prove their eligibility, leading Griffin to concede. The prolonged legal battle raised concerns about potential efforts to undermine election results after voting concludes.</p>

          <p>The future of the penny is uncertain as Congress considers ending its production, but dedicated collectors and enthusiasts are fighting to keep it alive. Despite the fact that it costs more to make than it's worth, many see value beyond its monetary worth. While some economists argue for its elimination due to practical and economic concerns, others, like the Kilcoyne family at the Penny Depot, worry about the impact on their business creating custom collectible pennies. The debate highlights the tension between economic efficiency and the sentimental value of the coin.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox discusses an attempt by Republican justices to overturn the election of a Democratic state Supreme Court Justice in North Carolina. The effort closely resembles Bush v. Gore (2000), with Republican justices attempting to disenfranchise voters in Democratic counties. This action violates the Constitution by retroactively changing election rules after the election has already taken place. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the state from certifying the result, but the case raises concerns about potential efforts to undermine election results.</p>

          <p>A higher education expert, Mark Kantrowitz, estimates that interest rates on federal direct undergraduate loans could decrease to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year. Graduate student loans are also expected to see a slight decrease in interest rates. These rates, set annually by the government, are based in part on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note. Borrowers can anticipate lower monthly payments and overall repayment costs compared to current rates, providing some relief for students and families financing higher education.</p>

The article suggests that the Trump administration could face similar challenges, including high costs, legal obstacles, and Rwanda's limited capacity to accommodate large numbers of deportees.

          <p>Researchers propose that the COVID-19 pandemic, like the SARS pandemic, originated in the wildlife trade. The study compares the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that both coronaviruses jumped from bats to wild mammals in southwestern China before spreading to humans in city markets. This conclusion contrasts with the Trump administration's assertion that COVID-19 resulted from a lab leak, creating political tension around scientific investigations into the virus's origins. The study highlights the risk of future pandemics stemming from wildlife trade in urban areas.</p>
