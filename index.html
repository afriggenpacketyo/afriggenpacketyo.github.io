        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties expressed mixed reactions. Republicans such as Sens. Graham and Cruz largely supported the action, while Democrats like House Leader Jeffries and Sen. Schumer criticized the lack of congressional consultation and warned of potential war escalation. The strikes have intensified the conflict between Iran and Israel, prompting debates about the president's authority to use military force without congressional approval, with some calling for impeachment. The situation remains tense, with lawmakers divided on the constitutionality and strategic implications of the U.S. intervention.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with Tel Aviv stocks reaching an all-time high amid hopes for a resolution to the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains; Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to ensure public safety. Egypt's EGX30 index was the region's top performer, closing significantly higher, while analysts suggest the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have mitigated short-term market impacts.

          <p>The United States has entered the Israel-Iran conflict by bombing three Iranian uranium enrichment sites, marking a critical escalation in the Middle East. President Trump confirmed the attacks, which involved B-2 Spirit bombers and bunker-busting warheads, reportedly causing significant damage to Iran's nuclear program. While the extent of the damage is still being verified, reports indicate no increase in off-site radiation levels, although the IAEA has warned of potential radiation leakage. The US involvement follows failed diplomatic efforts and concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions, with Trump seeking a swift resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump authorized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to carry out the attack on Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, according to a senior administration official. Trump departed his Bedminster golf club and returned to the White House for a national security meeting before issuing the order. Diplomatic efforts were underway in the week leading up to the strike, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff, while the Pentagon simultaneously prepared the military operation.

It also cautions that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to target Jewish groups and institutions.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is navigating a delicate diplomatic situation after the U.S. launched airstrikes on Iran, despite his calls for de-escalation. The UK government appears to support the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons development, but has avoided direct military involvement. Starmer's position has shifted since expressing confidence that President Trump would not intervene, and while the UK received advanced warning of the U.S. action, it was not asked to participate. The legality of potential UK involvement has been debated, and future requests for military support from the U.S. could present further challenges for the prime minister.</p>

This move coincided with a visit to Minsk by U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg, marking a rare high-profile American visit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on studies of parent-child relationships, certain phrases can trigger defiance in children, leading to decreased cooperation. Instead of using phrases like "Because I said so" or "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," parents should explain their reasoning and give children agency over their behavior. Dismissing a child's emotions or assuming they are intentionally difficult can also be counterproductive; instead, parents should validate their feelings and invite problem-solving. Shifting from punishment to partnership can foster trust and emotional resilience in children.</p>

          <h2>Health Secretary Says No Budget for Assisted Dying Service</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that there is no budget for an assisted dying service, despite MPs voting in favor of the legislation. Streeting, an opponent of the bill, cited a lack of access to high-quality end-of-life care and tight finances within the NHS as concerns, believing it could pressure dying patients. The government remains neutral on the bill, which has cleared the Commons and will now be scrutinized by the House of Lords, with campaigners arguing it will give terminally ill adults the choice on how they want to die and prevent painful deaths. Critics argue it risks people being coerced into seeking an assisted death.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber detonated himself inside the Mar Elias Church in Dweilâ€™a, Syria, killing at least 13 people and wounding over 50 others. The attack, the first of its kind in Syria in years, occurred during an afternoon Mass, with some reports indicating children were among the casualties. No group has immediately claimed responsibility, but the Syrian Interior Ministry attributed the attack to an extremist from the Islamic State group. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the attack, reaffirming the state's commitment to combating criminal organizations and protecting society.</p>

          <p>The U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved the largest strike using B2 bombers in history, with the first use of Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs. The mission involved over 125 aircraft, including seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers launched from the continental United States, which refueled multiple times in midair. Just before the airstrikes, two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at the Isfahan nuclear site from a U.S. submarine, and President Trump announced that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely obliterated. The purpose of the mission was to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.</p>

          <p>NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a benchmark long sought by the US, with Spain securing an exemption after initially opposing the measure. The deal requires all member nations except Spain to reach the 5% goal by 2035, with at least 3.5% of national GDP spent on core military needs and an additional 1.5% allocated for related expenditures. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez argued that the 5% figure was unreasonable and counterproductive, citing political pressure at home and Spain's ability to meet its NATO commitments with lower spending.</p>

          <p>Retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, former commander of CENTCOM, assessed the U.S. strikes on Iran as likely successful, potentially causing irreversible damage to Iran's nuclear program. He anticipates that CENTCOM is currently focused on potential Iranian responses and defending U.S. forces, embassies, and citizens in the region. McKenzie noted that Iranian decision-making may be hampered by the loss of senior leaders and suggested Iraq and Syria as potential areas of vulnerability. He emphasized the importance of making it clear to Iran that the U.S. possesses significant combat power and will use it if attacked.</p>

          <p>Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna discussed the war powers resolution to prohibit U.S. forces from engaging in hostilities against Iran without congressional authorization. Massie expressed concern that President Trump bypassed Congress and argued that the strikes lacked constitutional basis due to the absence of an imminent threat to the United States. Khanna criticized the decision to enter war without congressional briefing or vote, highlighting the risk of escalating conflict and wasting resources. The representatives emphasized the need to reassert Congress's authority in matters of war and questioned the long-term goals and consequences of the U.S. intervention.</p>

He also noted that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks unless Iran provokes further action and that closing the Strait of Hormuz would prompt a global response.</p>
