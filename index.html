          <p>Japan and the Philippines are scheduled to begin discussions on key security pacts to bolster their security cooperation in light of China's increasing maritime activities. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will meet in Manila to discuss an intelligence-sharing pact and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement. The two countries will also conduct joint coast guard drills and discuss the global economy amid U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the federal election, largely influenced by President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. The Liberal Party's win marks a turnaround attributed to voter concerns over American interference in Canadian sovereignty. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to look out for itself and build broader partnerships, declaring the old relationship with the U.S. over. Trump's remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state further fueled the election's focus on Canadian independence. Optimism Score: 70</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy alternatives. This move aims to tackle obesity by incentivizing manufacturers to reduce sugar content in these drinks. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the government now believes the health benefits do not justify the excess sugar.
