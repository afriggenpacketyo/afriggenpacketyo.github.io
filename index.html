          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware cyberattack that compromised customer data, including contact details and order histories, but not payment information. The attack, attributed to the DragonForce group, has led to the suspension of online orders for over two weeks, causing significant financial impact and affecting suppliers. The retailer is prompting customers to reset passwords and remains cautious about potential phishing attempts, with experts warning of possible identity fraud. The company's share price has also fallen since the technical problems started, with more than half a billion pounds wiped off the company's value.</p>

          <p>U.S. inflation experienced a slight dip in April, but economists and policymakers anticipate a resurgence in consumer prices due to President Trump's trade war. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent year-over-year, the slowest pace since early 2021, with monthly prices up 0.2 percent. However, economists warn that the impact of tariffs will soon be felt, potentially driving inflation as high as 3.5 percent by year-end. The article includes an interactive graphic breaking down the monthly changes in various CPI categories, highlighting both increases and decreases in specific sectors.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are criticizing the Federal Reserve's policies for exacerbating income inequality, arguing that billionaires have disproportionately benefited from post-COVID-19 monetary policies. The Fed's manipulation of interest rates and excessive money printing have driven up asset values, benefiting the wealthy who hold a larger share of assets. Economist Steve Hanke notes that billionaires' share of the GDP increased from 14.1% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2025 due to these policies. Vice President JD Vance has also criticized the administration for policies that hurt the working class and cater to Wall Street.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served almost 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The evidence pointed to an unknown attacker in semen samples preserved from the crime scene, leading the Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer the case back to the court. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. Merseyside Police has reopened the investigation into Miss Sindall's murder, but searches of the national DNA database have not yielded any matches.</p>

          <p>The trade truce between the U.S. and China provided relief after President Trump's tariffs significantly impacted North American and Asian manufacturing. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index indicated a steep retreat in April purchasing activity following a rush to stockpile supplies. Despite the truce, anxiety remains among U.S. manufacturers about reducing long-term risks associated with China. The data also showed an increase in spare capacity across Asian supply chains and a shift towards Southeast Asia and Europe for future supply chain growth.</p>

Experts say this is a win for consumers by providing more transparency, but it won't necessarily bring costs down. The rule aims to make pricing fairer by avoiding vague phrases and requiring clear disclosure of the amount and purpose of fees. The rule does not prohibit dynamic pricing or cap fees.</p>

          <p>The tariff truce between the U.S. and China offers temporary relief to companies, but the economic uncertainty remains. Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China will reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%. While the truce may improve consumer confidence and reduce the odds of a recession, clinching a long-term trade deal is likely to prove challenging. Experts warn that the reduced tariff rate could still lead to price hikes for consumers, and businesses face difficulties in planning for the future.</p>
