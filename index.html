          <p>A senior Hamas official stated that further ceasefire talks are pointless given Israel's approval of an expanded offensive, potentially involving the indefinite seizure of Palestinian territory. Israeli officials indicated the offensive would not commence until after President Trump's visit, offering Hamas a window to agree to a deal. The UN Secretary General warned that expanded ground operations would lead to more civilian deaths and destruction. This article details the escalating tensions and the bleak prospects for a ceasefire in the region, emphasizing the dire humanitarian situation and international concerns. Optimism Score: 10</p>

          <p>Deliveroo, a UK-based food delivery app, has agreed to be acquired by US giant DoorDash for £2.9 billion, creating a combined company with a presence in over 40 countries. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, aims to strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce and provide competition to rivals like Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. The article notes that this takeover raises concerns about UK investment as another UK-listed company is acquired by a US firm, with the combined company projected to serve approximately 50 million customers monthly.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss increased after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts, driven by weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. CEO Daniel Grieder confirmed the company's 2025 outlook, while noting that global trade tensions have impacted demand, adding that the company is monitoring the economic outlook closely.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in "foreign countries" has been met with confusion and concern in Hollywood. The film industry is a complex, globalized service industry, making it difficult to define and impose tariffs on cinema tickets or streaming subscriptions. The article suggests that the move is a prank aimed at the liberal media, causing confusion and unease, and potentially stalling production plans as studios assess new costs. Even if the tariffs are not implemented, the threat alone could damage the American film industry.</p>

          <p>China's economic narrative has been defined by supply-side reform, focusing on boosting productivity and cultivating new technologies, leading to global leadership in electric vehicles and AI. However, the time has come for a shift towards prioritizing demand, as signaled by the Communist Party's Politburo emphasizing the "four stabilities" and the need to boost household income and consumption. While China has successfully tackled industrial sectors and reined in property market speculation, supply-side success does not automatically translate into strength in demand, posing a significant challenge for the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government is providing £102m to around one in six GP practices in England to help them improve their buildings, marking the biggest public investment in facilities for five years. The funding aims to expand and modernize surgeries, with projects including converting office space into clinical consulting rooms and building new practices. This comes as satisfaction levels with GP services have hit record lows, and figures suggest two in five GPs report their practices are not fit for purpose. The Royal College of GPs described the funding as an "encouraging interim measure", while highlighting the need for long-term investment to tackle inadequate infrastructure.</p>

The report also highlights that recent cuts to international aid by several countries, led by the United States, will exacerbate the situation.

          <p>President Xi Jinping of China is believed to have ordered his armed forces to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027, if necessary, but an ongoing purge of top military ranks casts doubt on that deadline. Over the past two years, two defense ministers and several senior People’s Liberation Army officers have been removed, including leaders of the Rocket Force. The article raises questions about the competence and reliability of Mr. Xi’s military commanders, suggesting this may weaken his appetite for war and offer Taiwan and the United States time to strengthen their defenses.</p>

          <p>At the height of China’s rapid economic growth, it was unusual for the children of senior officials to follow their parents into the public sector, but the trend appears to be reversing. Government jobs are seen as decent and secure, but they are low-paid and demanding, with more constraints on personal choices compared to the private sector. However, the ruling Communist Party has tightened the rules around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption drive, and amid a slowing economy, more officials are working with colleagues from privileged backgrounds.</p>
