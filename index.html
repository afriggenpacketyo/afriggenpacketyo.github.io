          <h2>Fintech Startup Imprint Secures Rakuten Co-Branded Credit Card Partnership Over Major Banks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:54:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card startup Imprint has successfully secured a deal to launch a new co-branded card with online shopping platform Rakuten, outbidding several major banks in the process. This marks a significant victory for the five-year-old fintech company, which recently raised an additional $70 million, increasing its valuation to $900 million. Imprint focuses on providing a seamless digital experience and transparent fee structures, differentiating itself from established players like JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony. The new Rakuten card, which will operate on the American Express network, aims to attract customers by offering enhanced cash-back rewards without relying on what the company calls regressive late fees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declassified and released 230,000 pages of documents related to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., including FBI surveillance files. This release follows a 1977 court order that had kept the records sealed, and it has drawn criticism from Dr. King's living children, who warned against misusing the files to undermine their father's legacy. They highlighted the historical context of the government's invasive surveillance campaign against the civil rights leader. Despite the large volume of documents, some historians and experts have stated that the files contain little new or notable information beyond what was already publicly known.</p>

          <h2>Increased UK Government Borrowing Intensifies Pressure on Chancellor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:50:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a £6.6 billion increase from the previous year and higher than analysts had anticipated. This rise, attributed to greater spending on public services and soaring debt interest payments, has heightened financial pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The interest payments on government debt nearly doubled due to inflation-linked bonds. Economists suggest that this trend, combined with recent reversals on welfare cuts and a weak economic outlook, makes future tax hikes or spending cuts increasingly probable in the upcoming Autumn Budget to adhere to fiscal targets.

          <p>Crystal Palace has formally appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote the club from the Europa League to the Conference League. The punishment was enacted due to a breach of multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in Lyon, another Europa League qualifier. The club argues that Textor does not wield decisive influence over its operations and is seeking to have the decision annulled. If the appeal fails, Nottingham Forest is expected to take Crystal Palace's spot in the more prestigious Europa League competition, with a final verdict anticipated by August 11.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has confirmed that a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England will proceed as scheduled, beginning on Friday. The decision comes after five days of negotiations with the government failed to produce a resolution, despite hopes for a breakthrough. While discussions covered non-pay issues such as exam fee coverage and better control over work placements, the government remained firm on its pay offer. The BMA maintains that doctors' real-term wages have fallen significantly since 2008 and continues to demand pay restoration, leading to the continuation of industrial action.</p>

The trend is further fueled by social media influencers and the rising use of medical weight-loss drugs, whose users often seek higher protein foods.

The move is part of a strategy to offer differentiated experiences for consumers. While some health advocates criticize corn syrup, experts note that cane sugar is not necessarily a healthier alternative, as excess sugar consumption from any source poses health risks.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's public statements reveals a long-standing pattern of criticizing the Federal Reserve based on which political party holds the presidency. The article argues that his hostility towards Fed Chair Jerome Powell is not about economic management but rather a desire for monetary policy to favor Republican administrations. During the Obama years, Trump consistently argued that interest rates were too low, creating a "false economy." Conversely, since becoming president, he has aggressively pushed for lower rates, even when the economy was strong, and has accused the Fed of political bias when its decisions do not align with his short-term political goals.</p>

Instead of striving for a single, fixed authentic self, she recommends practicing "self-leadership."

          <h2>Financial Experts Weigh In on the Current Attractiveness of Annuity Rates</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, financial experts are noting that annuity rates are currently very competitive, with some providers offering yields significantly higher than in recent years. This has been driven by rising Treasury yields and increased competition among issuers as more baby boomers seek guaranteed retirement income. However, with uncertainty around future Federal Reserve policy, there is debate on whether to lock in rates now or wait. Experts advise that while the timing may seem favorable, the decision should be based on individual financial needs, such as liquidity and long-term goals, rather than trying to perfectly time the market.

          <p>The Bronx campaign office of U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was vandalized with red paint early Monday morning. The incident occurred after a recent House vote on an amendment that would have cut funding for Israel's missile defense system, a vote that drew criticism from some progressive groups. A sign left at the scene accused the congresswoman of funding "genocide in Gaza," a claim she refuted as a lie on social media.

          <p>China's exports showed accelerated growth in June, partly due to a rush of orders from U.S. companies trying to import goods before a potential tariff hike in August. Despite this, data revealed that exports to the United States still fell by 16% compared to the previous year, though this was an improvement from the 34.5% drop seen in May. Overall Chinese trade data for the first half of the year showed continued growth globally, with significant increases in exports to Southeast Asia and Europe.

          <p>A Guardian opinion piece strongly criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court for a recent order that allows the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education. The author argues that the court's conservative supermajority ignored legal precedents and constitutional separation of powers by permitting the executive branch to gut a congressionally created agency without legislative approval. The dissent from the liberal justices warned that the court was expediting, rather than checking, the president's lawlessness. The article contends that this decision is part of a dangerous pattern of the court weakening democratic institutions and handing excessive power to an authoritarian-minded president.</p>

Despite Beijing's recent conciliatory gestures towards Brussels, a significant reset in China-EU ties appears unlikely without substantive changes in strategic posture from both sides. Hopes for a breakthrough at the upcoming China-EU summit in Beijing are tempered by ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

          <p>The former U.S. embassy building on London's Grosvenor Square, once a symbol of American power and a frequent site of protests, has been transformed into an exclusive luxury hotel called the Chancery Rosewood. This article reflects on the symbolic shift, as a heavily fortified diplomatic building is now a lavish enclave for the global super-rich, with nightly rates reaching over £24,000. The author notes the irony that capitalism has succeeded where protesters failed, taking over the building for the benefit of the 1%. The conversion is part of a wider trend in London where historic state-owned properties are being commodified for the ultra-wealthy.</p>

She specifically cited an unsettling late-night encounter with Trump in Epstein's offices in 1995 as the reason for her concern.
