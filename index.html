          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, set to begin in August. The move is explicitly linked to the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which President Trump labeled a "Witch Hunt" and an "international disgrace." This action is notable as the U.S. currently holds a trade surplus with Brazil, and the letter also criticized Brazil over digital trade practices and its alignment with the BRICS group of nations. The proposed tariff is the highest rate threatened against any country in the recent wave of trade actions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Secret Service has suspended six of its personnel without pay following the assassination attempt on President Trump in Pennsylvania nearly a year ago. The disciplinary actions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, come after intense scrutiny and a bipartisan House report that identified "tragic and preventable" security failures. A senior agency official stated they are focused on fixing systemic deficiencies, such as improving communications and drone technology, rather than simply firing staff. The incident had previously led to the resignation of the agency's director.</p>

          <p>Following the significant mayoral primary victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City, his allies are reportedly considering launching primary challenges against established Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Supporters of the move argue that Jeffries is out of touch with the growing progressive base in his district. In response, a senior political advisor to Jeffries warned that any such challenge would be met with a "forceful and unrelenting" response, emphasizing the party's focus on countering MAGA extremists.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, announced it has engineered its own hardware solution to cool the next generation of power-hungry Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. The new system, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), was developed because existing commercial options were too slow to implement or inefficient for AWS's massive scale. This custom hardware allows AWS to integrate Nvidia's latest high-density GPU clusters into its data centers more effectively. The move reflects a broader trend of major cloud providers developing bespoke infrastructure to optimize performance and control costs in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

In contrast, Mbappé and his fellow Real Madrid stars appeared disjointed and unable to counter PSG's cohesive and energetic system.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to levy a 50% tariff on copper imports has raised alarms among economists about potential price hikes for a wide range of consumer goods. Copper is a crucial component in construction, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles, and the tariff threat alone caused its market price to surge. Experts warn that increased costs for manufacturers would likely be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation and affecting everything from home repairs to the cost of maintaining the nation's electrical grid. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to reshore critical manufacturing and bolster national security. (not investment advice)</p>

The inconsistent flow of aid forces Ukrainian commanders to make difficult logistical adjustments and could be interpreted by Russia as waning U.S. support.

An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that if the party gains any traction, it would likely harm Republicans more than Democrats by peeling off swing voters and the "crackpot vote" from the MAGA coalition.

          <p>Swiss tennis player Belinda Bencic is preparing for her first Wimbledon semi-final, where she will face five-time major champion Iga Swiatek. The 28-year-old former Olympic champion, who is also a new mother, revealed she visualizes her game plan before sleeping to prepare for matches. Bencic is seeking to become the first mother to win the Wimbledon singles title in 45 years and has had a surprisingly strong season after returning from maternity leave.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued letters to at least 20 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, threatening to impose steep new tariffs by August 1. The proposed rates vary, with some nations like Myanmar and Laos facing duties as high as 40%, while others face levies between 20% and 36%. This move follows the expiration of a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs, with the administration stating that no extensions will be granted. Economists warn that the broad application of these tariffs could reignite inflation and disrupt global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to news that an AI-generated voice impersonating Marco Rubio has been contacting high-level officials, The Atlantic published a satirical piece listing signs that a caller is not the real senator. The humorous "tells" include the caller not aggressively drinking bottled water, having a strong backbone, and expressing regret over the consequences of U.S. policy decisions. The article uses satire to critique the senator's political stances and public persona. The underlying news story reported that an unknown individual has used the AI voice to contact at least five government officials.</p>

A significant number of the deceased were campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp. President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration, enabling FEMA to support the massive search effort involving local, state, and volunteer teams.</p>

          <p>President Trump's White House summit with leaders from five African nations—Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—is seen as a reflection of his "trade, not aid" foreign policy. Analysts suggest the meeting is driven by a desire to secure access to the continent's valuable natural resources, including rare earth minerals, amid growing competition from China and Russia. The discussions are also expected to cover issues like migration and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea. The invited leaders, who praised Trump during the meeting, are all facing 10% U.S. tariffs and may be seeking to negotiate better trade terms.</p>

The potential deal reflects ongoing consolidation in the packaged foods industry, as many legacy cereal brands have faced declining sales due to consumer shifts toward healthier breakfast options and private-label alternatives.

This claim is part of a broader Republican effort to blame various tragedies on DEI policies, a strategy also employed by President Trump.

This legal action is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to restrict transgender rights, which includes a directive to strip funding from schools with inclusive policies.
