        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a rescissions package to claw back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. The cuts primarily target foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports stations in rural areas. The bill, a key objective for the Trump administration's efforts to reduce spending, passed by a narrow 51-48 margin after a contentious overnight session. It now returns to the House of Representatives for a final vote, where its passage is uncertain due to changes made in the Senate.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been conducting extensive military drills, including nighttime flight training and simulated dogfights, coinciding with Taiwan's largest-ever Han Kuang exercise. The PLA's Eastern Theatre Command released details of its naval and air force activities, which analysts interpret as a direct response and a show of force toward Taiwan. While the exact dates were not specified, the timing and nature of the drills suggest a coordinated effort to increase pressure on the island as its own major military exercises conclude.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old teacher was stabbed and severely wounded while attempting to intervene in an argument at an elementary school's musical performance in Alblasserdam, Netherlands. The incident, which was witnessed by many children and parents, occurred during a traditional end-of-year show. Dutch police have since arrested three male suspects in connection with the attack.

          <p>Following renewed Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping that have caused fatalities and sunk vessels, some Middle East experts are urging the Trump administration to increase support for Yemen's anti-Houthi factions. Walid Phares, a former Trump advisor, suggests backing a ground force composed of the legitimate Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council to reclaim key territory. The calls for a more aggressive stance come as the State Department condemns the Iran-sponsored group's actions, which have continued despite a previous halt in U.S. military strikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check by DW has determined that claims circulating on social media that sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer are false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion. The article explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer in countries with high sunscreen use is likely due to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historical use of less effective products. Experts emphasize that erratic application and a false sense of security contribute more to skin damage than the sunscreen itself.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has risen to £1,076 per child, according to new figures from the charity Coram. Prices have seen significant regional variations, with some areas experiencing hikes of up to 13% compared to last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of affordable council-run options. Many working families struggle with the upfront costs, as government support through Universal Credit is paid in arrears, making it difficult to secure a place in advance for their children.</p>

          <p>At Donald Trump's urging, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in an effort to gain up to five additional seats for the GOP. This move is seen as a high-risk strategy that could dilute the voting power of the state's growing non-white population and potentially make some Republican districts more competitive. Critics and watchdog groups argue the plan is an undemocratic effort to gerrymander districts and would trample on minority voting rights, while the legal justification provided by the state is being heavily questioned by experts.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly in advanced negotiations to sign striker Hugo Ekitike from German club Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal expected to be worth over £70 million. According to multiple sources, the Premier League champions are aiming to finalize the transfer by the upcoming weekend. The offer from Liverpool is anticipated to exceed a rejected £70 million bid from Newcastle. The move aligns with Liverpool's strategy to sign a central striker, and Ekitike is said to be open to joining the club.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread public and political calls to "release the Epstein Files," it is improbable that the full unredacted documents from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation will be made public. This is primarily due to a long-standing Department of Justice policy that prevents the release of closed investigative files, aiming to protect uncharged individuals and maintain investigative integrity. The article explains that while Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Trump have the power to override this policy, their recent statements and actions suggest they will not, leaving the public's demand for full transparency unsatisfied.</p>

Encounters with bears in Japan have reached record levels, attributed to factors like climate change affecting food sources and a shrinking rural human population, which allows bears to expand their habitat into previously populated areas.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's Department of Justice suggests a significant shift away from prosecuting white-collar and corporate crime. The administration has paused enforcement of anti-bribery laws, and federal prosecutions for such crimes have declined over 10% compared to last year. While the DOJ has stated it will focus on specific areas like healthcare fraud, it appears to prioritize crimes that align with political narratives against immigrants or opponents. This approach, combined with high-profile pardons of financial fraudsters, signals a more business-friendly and less stringent enforcement environment.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates are raising alarms that the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system will make monthly payments unaffordable for many. The popular SAVE repayment plan is now defunct, and a new bill will drastically reduce the number of income-driven repayment options for future borrowers. The new primary income-based plan, known as RAP, is projected to result in significantly higher monthly payments compared to SAVE. Experts warn this shift could leave many borrowers with no manageable payment plans, thereby increasing their risk of defaulting on their loans.</p>

Unlike other presidents, Trump is less susceptible to political pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups because their supporters have no viable alternative. The article suggests that Trump's transactional nature, allergy to high foreign expenditures, and immense ego—particularly his desire for a Nobel Peace Prize—could be leveraged to persuade him to push for a genuine resolution, such as a two-state solution, rather than continuing to underwrite the conflict.</p>
