          <p>A team of thieves disguised as construction workers executed a swift, well-planned robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday morning. Using a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor window, they smashed display cases in the Apollo gallery and stole numerous pieces of historic jewelry, including items that belonged to Napoleon. The entire operation took approximately seven minutes, after which the perpetrators escaped on motorcycles, prompting a full museum closure and a major police investigation into the high-profile theft.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the World Cup semi-finals following a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. Despite a strong performance from India's Smriti Mandhana, a late-game collapse allowed England to clinch the win, successfully defending their total of 288. Heather Knight's century was instrumental for England, but the team's middle-order performance showed some weakness. The victory marks a crucial step for England as they approach the tournament's final stages.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Colombian President Gustavo Petro, labeling him an "illegal drug dealer" and threatening to immediately cut U.S. funding to the nation. The statement follows Petro's accusation that a recent U.S. military strike in Colombian waters constituted "murder." This escalation highlights growing tensions between the two countries, despite Colombia's historical status as a key U.S. ally in Latin America. The dispute centers on U.S. military operations targeting alleged drug trafficking vessels in the region.</p>

          <p>While a 20% investment loss requires a 25% gain to break even, historical data for the S&P 500 shows the market consistently recovers from downturns with significantly larger gains. This phenomenon is described as "asymmetric upside," where the potential for growth in bull markets far outweighs the losses from bear markets. For example, the 55% decline during the 2007 financial crisis was followed by a 527% return over the next 11 years. This analysis underscores the long-term growth potential of diversified stock market investing despite periodic and sometimes severe setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, the Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play in a FIFA-sanctioned tournament. The newly formed squad, composed of players now living in Australia, the UK, and Europe, will compete in the UAE, marking a major step toward official recognition. For players like defender Najma Arefi, the games represent more than just sport; they are an act of defiance and a way to represent the silenced women and girls in Afghanistan who have been stripped of their basic human rights.</p>

          <p>The streets of Madrid were filled with the sounds of bells and bleating as thousands of sheep and goats were herded through the city for the annual Transhumance Festival. The event, which draws large crowds of locals and tourists, honors the ancient pastoral practice of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds. Organizers use the festival to highlight the environmental benefits of traditional grazing, which helps prevent wildfires by clearing flammable undergrowth. The tradition also includes a symbolic payment of medieval coins to city officials for the animals' right of passage.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Qatar and Turkey and aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace between the two nations. The clashes, the worst since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, were fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups. Both sides have reported heavy casualties, and under the new agreement, they have pledged to end hostile actions and refrain from targeting each other's forces and civilians.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jared Kushner, a key architect of the recent Israel-Hamas peace deal, stated in an interview that the long-term success of the agreement hinges on creating a viable governing alternative to Hamas in Gaza. He acknowledged that Hamas would likely use violence to try and regain control, but argued that if international partners and Israel can establish a functional, apolitical governing body, Hamas's influence will fail. The peace plan calls for an interim committee of qualified Palestinians and international experts to run Gaza's public services, a critical step that has yet to be implemented.</p>

          <p>An American woman who moved from Texas to Spain ten years ago shares seven aspects of U.S. life she no longer misses, highlighting major cultural and lifestyle differences.
