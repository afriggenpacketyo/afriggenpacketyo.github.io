          <p>The UK government plans to invest £1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment aims to support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country. Defense Secretary John Healey emphasized that lessons from the war in Ukraine highlight the need for a strong domestic defense industry. The move is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review and aims to ensure an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza, indicating acceptance but seeking amendments to the plan. The militant group aims for a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal, and unimpeded humanitarian aid, including the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official noted that the amendments pertain to U.S. guarantees, hostage release timing, aid delivery, and Israeli forces' withdrawal. The U.S. envoy to the Middle East deemed the response "totally unacceptable," while Hamas insists it is a responsible approach to meet the needs of the Palestinian people.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, is facing scrutiny over its effectiveness and sustainability. Satellite data and field reports suggest that the program struggles with natural resource plundering, replacing native forests with plantations of invasive exotic species. Analysis indicates that some NGP sites experience deforestation events, with native trees cleared to grow cash crops. The program's complexities and focus on monoculture undermine sustainable livelihoods for local communities, raising questions about its long-term impact and potential for greenwashing.</p>
