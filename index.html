          <p>The House Oversight Committee has received documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including a "birthday book" that reportedly contains a bawdy letter from Donald Trump. Democrats on the committee released an image of the purported letter, which Trump has vehemently denied writing, leading him to file a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the matter. The investigation into Epstein's records involves both parties on the committee, continuing scrutiny of the late financier's connections.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing police staffing shortages in Chicago, local and state Democratic leaders are rejecting President Trump's proposals to deploy the National Guard to address crime. Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker have argued against federal intervention, emphasizing local efforts and community programs. The Chicago Police Department remains over 2,000 officers short of its 2019 peak, a situation that has persisted since the 2020 "defund the police" movement.</p>

While a quarter-point reduction remains the most likely scenario, with an 88% probability priced in, the disappointing labor market data has increased bets on more aggressive easing. Analysts believe the soft jobs numbers solidify the case for rate cuts to resume, though a 50-basis-point move would require broader consensus within the committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision to lift an injunction on immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles highlights the judiciary's reluctance to impose broad restrictions on law enforcement. A lower court had barred federal agents from detaining people based solely on factors like ethnicity or language, but the Supreme Court's majority allowed these stops to resume. The ruling, issued on the emergency "shadow docket," was sharply criticized by dissenting justices for effectively legalizing racial profiling of Latinos.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court found no errors in the lower court's rulings and deemed the damages awarded to be fair and reasonable. Trump's legal team had argued the verdict was excessive and invalid due to presidential immunity, but the panel of judges was not persuaded by these claims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is approaching a potential shutdown as the September 30th funding deadline nears without a budget agreement in place. With only three weeks remaining for Congress to negotiate and pass legislation, the familiar political standoff has begun. Prediction markets currently place the odds of a shutdown at approximately 50%, setting the stage for a high-stakes fiscal cliffhanger in Washington.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit from 19 states and the District of Columbia challenging the Trump administration's mass firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. The court ruled 2-1 that the states lacked the legal standing to sue over the terminations, which were part of an effort to reduce the size of the federal government. The decision sends the case back to a lower court with instructions to dismiss it, overturning a previous order to reinstate the affected workers.</p>

Israel is reportedly considering the plan, which would also include a full Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of an independent body to govern Gaza.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Justice is suing Los Angeles County and its sheriff over what the state's attorney general described as a "humanitarian crisis" in the county jail system.

The state is demanding comprehensive reforms to ensure adequate care and humane conditions for the roughly 13,000 people incarcerated daily.</p>

          <p>The ousting of French Prime Minister François Bayrou has intensified concerns about France's fiscal stability and its potential impact on the eurozone. With national debt at approximately €3.35 trillion, or 113% of GDP, and the largest budget deficit in the EU, France's financial situation is precarious. Economists worry that the political deadlock will prevent necessary austerity measures, potentially destabilizing the single currency if the crisis in the eurozone's second-largest economy escalates.
