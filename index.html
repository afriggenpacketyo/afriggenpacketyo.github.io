          <p>Amazon is extending its annual Prime Day event to four days, starting on July 8th and running through July 11th. The company plans to introduce themed "deal drops" that will change daily and be available while supplies last, adding a sense of urgency for shoppers. Prime Day was initially launched in 2015 to attract new members to its Prime loyalty program and boost sales during the summer. The event has since become a significant revenue driver for other retailers as well, who often host competing discount events during the same period.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's call for immediate evacuation of Tehran, many Iranians are expressing fear and dismay, posting images of their homes online as they decide whether to flee or shelter in place. Traffic congestion has made leaving the city difficult, with journeys taking up to 14 hours, as residents fear potential attacks amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Some residents are choosing to stay due to elderly parents, young children, medical needs, or lack of options, despite Israeli strikes on Iranian state broadcaster adding to their concerns. Trump's comments were reportedly followed by explosions and air defense fire in Tehran, with both sides accusing each other of targeting residential areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, returning to Washington due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Iran conflict. He denied his early return was related to ceasefire talks, stating the situation was "much bigger than that." Trump's departure followed Israeli strikes on Iranian state television and evacuation orders for residents of Tehran, though the U.S. maintains it is not directly involved in Israel's military actions. Despite the conflict, Trump affirmed that a trade deal was signed with the UK and that he had spoken with everyone regarding Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged Israel and Iran to de-escalate tensions to avoid further conflict, emphasizing Beijing's readiness to play a constructive role in restoring peace. He stated that China opposes any actions infringing upon the sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity of other countries, highlighting that military conflict is not the solution. In response to growing concerns, Beijing has begun evacuating Chinese nationals from Iran and Israel amid the escalating regional conflict, with some being relocated to neighboring countries.

Despite similar outright performance, Piastri is delivering more consistently, capitalizing on Norris' mistakes in qualifying. The article questions whether Norris is feeling pressure from Piastri or the opportunity to win a world title, leading to over-striving.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Criticism is emerging around the portrayal of women in media, particularly those who are perceived as catering to male attention. The controversy stems from observations that certain women's lyrics and images are too "male-centered," leading to labels like "pick-me" or "not a girl's girl." This criticism is fueled by concerns about gender, power, and the influence of social media, where conservative propaganda and patriarchal trends can easily spread. The discourse echoes previous feminist movements, highlighting ongoing tensions around gender and sexuality in a climate where every image feels like a weapon in a cultural gender war.</p>

High taxes, bureaucracy, and experiences of discrimination are contributing factors, along with a political atmosphere dominated by migration debates.

          <p>President Trump stated he would not call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers, citing Walz as "slick" and "whacked out." Trump added that Walz "doesn't have a clue" and that calling him would "waste time." This decision contrasts with the typical presidential practice of reaching out to elected officials during times of tragedy to offer condolences. Walz was Kamala Harris's vice presidential running mate in 2024, during which he often criticized Trump.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that appendix cancer rates are increasing among young adults, specifically those born after the 1970s. While still rare, the incidence has tripled or quadrupled compared to those born in the 1940s, which is part of a broader trend of rising cancer rates in young adults worldwide. Researchers suspect environmental factors, such as exposure to microplastics and "forever chemicals," dietary changes, and alterations in the gut microbiome, may be contributing.

ADCs are designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing side effects. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck have invested billions in developing ADCs, with some showing promise in clinical trials. However, challenges remain in refining these treatments, identifying the right targets, and managing side effects, and it may take years before ADCs fully replace chemotherapy.</p>
