            <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC) to include aides who strongly support President Trump's agenda, following the departure of six individuals earlier in April. Derek Harvey, a military intelligence analyst, is expected to be appointed as senior director for intelligence, replacing Brian Walsh. Retired Lt. Col. Michael Jensen is also likely to join the NSC, potentially as senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs, a position that has been vacant. Harvey previously served on the NSC during Trump's first term but was ousted by H.R. McMaster due to differing views.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. Van Hollen shared a photo of the meeting on social media, stating that he had relayed a message of love from Abrego Garcia to his wife. Abrego Garcia's wife reported that El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele arranged the meeting. The White House criticized Van Hollen's trip, alleging Abrego Garcia is a gang member, a claim disputed in court. The Supreme Court has ordered the U.S. government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

            <p>President Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed optimism about a potential trade deal between the US and Europe during Meloni's visit to Washington. Trump stated there would "100%" be a trade deal, while Meloni aimed to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amidst strained relations and concerns over Trump's tariffs. Meloni previously criticized the tariffs as "absolutely wrong". Meloni secured an invitation for Trump to visit Rome, providing an opportunity for him to meet with other European leaders, potentially including European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen.</p>

            <p>The global economy is navigating an escalating trade war and policy changes driven by the US administration, with Trump imposing tariffs that have introduced severe volatility into global markets and undermined the foundations of trade. While provocative statements about annexing Canada or Greenland were largely dismissed, the trade policies have far-reaching consequences. The lack of a clear international response is puzzling, raising questions about fear, complacency, or a lack of options. Tariffs impose significant costs, disrupt global supply chains, and ultimately harm consumers.</p>

            <p>U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has halted the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project near Long Island, and Equinor, the project's owner, is complying. The decision escalates the Trump administration's opposition to offshore wind. The project already had federal permits and had broken ground. Burgum claimed the approval was rushed without sufficient analysis, though this is disputed by experts, as the project had undergone a thorough environmental review. The halt disrupts a needed electricity supply to the region and threatens New York's goal of developing 9,000 megawatts in offshore wind energy by 2035.</p>

            <p>A resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, was delayed until May 9 after a contentious day in court. The hearing was intended to determine if the brothers should receive a new sentence that could allow their release after serving three decades. The delay was prompted by a request from prosecutors to review a new report assessing whether the brothers would pose a danger to the public if released. The defense attorney also declared he would seek the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office from the case.</p>

SeaCURE processes seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell should be cutting interest rates and that his "termination cannot come fast enough." Trump's comments followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war. Trump also pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cut and accused Powell of being "TOO LATE AND WRONG." Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard, with President Trump calling for the university’s tax-exempt status to be revoked. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to enact the president’s demand, a move that would cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. This is a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions. The White House has urged Harvard to change its hiring, teaching and admissions practices to help fight antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Canada faces a severe housing affordability crisis, with "regular" homes in cities like Vancouver costing millions. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000; now, it is more than C$2m. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage. All major federal parties have put forward plans to fix the crisis, with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike over the removal of the role of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO), who were paid more than some other bin workers. Unite, the union representing the striking workers, claims that the scrapping of the WRCO role will leave some workers having to accept pay cuts of up to £8,000. The council says that the figures are "incorrect" and "no-one will lose £8,000 per annum". A consultation on plans for compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on 3 April.</p>
