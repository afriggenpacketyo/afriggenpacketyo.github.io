          <p>A public disagreement between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has escalated into a full-blown feud, with both using their prominent platforms to attack each other. Trump expressed disappointment in Musk's criticism of his tax and spending legislation, while Musk accused Trump of ingratitude and hinted at the existence of compromising information in unreleased files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The relationship between the two had previously been a powerful alliance, with Musk holding a key position in the Trump administration focused on government efficiency. However, the recent exchange suggests a complete breakdown, with any previous invitations likely rescinded. The former allies are now trading insults and threats.

          <p>Several individuals from Bryan Kohberger's past in Pennsylvania have been summoned to testify in his upcoming trial for the murders of four University of Idaho students. Witnesses include Jesse Harris, associated with a boxing gym where Kohberger trained, Ann Parham, an advisor at Kohberger's school, and Marie Bolger, a former professor. Bolger described Kohberger as one of her brightest students, noting his master's thesis focused on criminal behavior.

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as the chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected is no longer "a good use of my time." His resignation follows criticism of the party's newest MP for calling on Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka. Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's departure, describing him as enormously talented. Yusuf, who previously aimed to professionalize the party and woo donors, had been instrumental in Reform's recent electoral successes. The optimism score for this article is 45.</p>

          <p>Lululemon shares tumbled after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, citing a "dynamic macroenvironment." Despite beating Wall Street expectations for fiscal first-quarter earnings, the company is navigating tariffs and fears about a slowing U.S. economy. CEO Calvin McDonald stated that Lululemon intends to leverage its financial strength to invest in growth opportunities. The company's report follows similar actions by other retailers who have reduced or withdrawn their guidance due to uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff regime.

          <p>Using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off a mortgage offers flexibility, controlled costs, and competitive rates, with interest-only payments during the draw period. However, HELOCs come with variable interest rates, potential prepayment penalties, and the risk of foreclosure. Qualifying requires sufficient home equity, a strong credit score, and verifiable income. Alternatives include refinancing, home equity loans, mortgage recasts, and extra mortgage payments.
