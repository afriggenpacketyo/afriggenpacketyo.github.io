          <h2>German Chancellor and Christian Clerics Address Deadly Israeli Strike on Gaza Church</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made a rare criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza, labeling them "no longer acceptable" and calling for an immediate ceasefire. His comments followed a deadly Israeli strike on the Holy Family Church, which had been sheltering civilians. In response, two of Jerusalem's most senior Christian clerics, the Latin Patriarch and his Greek Orthodox counterpart, traveled to Gaza to offer condolences and solidarity to the local Christian community. This diplomatic shift is significant given Germany's historical and staunch support for Israel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a crucial election, far-right political parties in Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These nationalist groups are using concerns over unruly tourists, fueled by a weak yen, and unsubstantiated claims linking foreigners to rising crime to push their agenda. This strategy mirrors populist movements in the U.S. and Europe, creating a contentious political environment as Japan grapples with labor shortages and the cultural impacts of increased foreign presence.</p>

          <p>Chevron has won a crucial arbitration case against Exxon Mobil concerning the rights to Hess Corporation's valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce removes a major obstacle, clearing the way for Chevron to finalize its $53 billion acquisition of Hess. The dispute had cast significant doubt on the deal's completion, but with this resolution, Chevron's market position is strengthened, and it will now join the successful Guyana oil venture alongside Exxon.

          <p>A man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna aircraft in British Columbia, causing a major security incident. The suspect allegedly threatened a flight instructor and flew the plane to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. Authorities stated the man acted with an "ideological motive to disrupt airspace," with social media posts linked to him suggesting a belief that he was a messianic figure sent to save humanity from climate change.</p>

          <p>A video clip from a Coldplay concert has gone viral after the arena's "kiss cam" focused on a man and woman who reacted with apparent horror instead of affection. The pair, who quickly recoiled and hid their faces, were identified online as the CEO of a software company and his head of human resources. Their mortified reaction has fueled rampant online speculation that they were having an affair, turning a lighthearted concert moment into a widely discussed case of public and professional embarrassment.</p>

Forecasters predict torrential rain, with some areas potentially receiving over a month's worth of rainfall in just a few hours, creating a high risk of flash flooding. This severe weather event, which also includes hazards like frequent lightning and large hail, follows a period of prolonged drought that has impacted much of the country.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor and her husband have each been jailed for 10 months for stealing and reselling Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) from a hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The couple made almost £8,000 by selling stolen gloves and masks on eBay at the height of the crisis in 2020, a time when the NHS faced critical shortages of the same equipment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis projects that health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are set to rise by an average of 15% next year, a record-setting pace. This sharp increase is largely attributed to the Republican-passed budget bill that allows enhanced federal subsidies to expire. Experts warn that without these subsidies, which made coverage affordable for millions, many people will be forced to drop their insurance, leading to a sicker, more expensive risk pool and further destabilizing the market.

          <p>Luxury fashion house Burberry has seen its shares rise by over 8% following a reported 4% increase in sales in the Americas.

This uptick provides a sign of encouragement for the brand's ongoing turnaround plan under CEO Joshua Schulman, despite broader headwinds in the global luxury sector. (not investment advice)</p>
