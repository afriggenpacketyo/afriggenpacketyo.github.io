          <p>Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls, will be deposed in a lawsuit concerning a shooting that occurred during a White Sox game in August 2023. A 42-year-old woman was shot in the leg, prompting the lawsuit which accuses the team of negligence. The shooting's circumstances remain unclear, as weapons are prohibited in the stadium, and fans undergo metal detector screenings upon entry. The game continued despite the incident, and the shooting also led to the cancellation of a Vanilla Ice concert scheduled after the game. Optimism surrounding the situation is low considering the circumstances. </p>

Read's parents acknowledged the misogynistic comments and dehumanization she faced, stating the experience has motivated them to advocate for others in need. Despite the acquittal, the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family.</p>

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed without prejudice, just before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020. Prosecutors cited the need to investigate further and a belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body as reasons for the dismissal. The defense attorney maintained Morphew's innocence and criticized the prosecution for manufacturing a murder case. The case has been marked by bizarre twists and turns, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, a "talking" truck, mystery DNA, and a spy pen; in May 2023, Barry Morphew filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve the conflict. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The Department of Homeland Security had previously informed Harvard that it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism, but the school sued, arguing political motivations. The situation has significant implications for Harvard, where approximately one in four students are international, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered additional vetting for anyone traveling to Harvard from abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rhode Island state House, controlled by Democrats, has passed a bill that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who has expressed support for such bans. The bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession, making it similar to Washington state's law. Critics argue that the ban does little to curb mass shootings and only punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call it the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, reflecting the growing global popularity of Japanese entertainment content. While this trend, known as "seichi junrei," boosts local economies, it also presents challenges such as overtourism, requiring local governments to develop multilingual support systems.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents have revealed that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had given his wife a "bailout plan."

Law enforcement discovered empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter.

The clash, which left one Cambodian soldier dead, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, a key trade gateway for China.

          <p>Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, with a federal judge ruling he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The government argued his activism impeded US foreign policy and moved to deport him, but the judge ruled that the government could not detain or deport the 30-year-old legal US resident under that reasoning. The White House maintains that Judge Michael Farbiarz did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release and expects to be vindicated on appeal.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested he may attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Trump called Powell a "Total and Complete Moron" and a "dumb guy" for keeping rates steady, despite Trump's repeated calls for cuts to stimulate economic growth. Any attempt to fire Powell would likely face legal challenges, as federal law states that members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors can only be fired "for cause." The Fed has declined to comment on the president's remarks.</p>

Many companies, including Accenture and British American Tobacco, don't have explicit dress codes but expect staff to dress professionally, however, some companies are okay with more casual attire. The perception of shorts also differs between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of holiday settings.</p>
