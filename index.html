          <p>Chicago Cubs legend Ryne Sandberg, a celebrated Hall of Fame second baseman, has passed away at the age of 65 following a battle with prostate cancer. Known for his integrity and competitive spirit, Sandberg's career was highlighted by nine Gold Gloves, a National League MVP award in 1984, and ten All-Star selections. His defining moment, the "Sandberg Game" in 1984, propelled the Cubs to their first postseason appearance in decades. After retiring, he remained a beloved ambassador for the team, which honored him with a statue outside Wrigley Field.</p>

          <p>A gunman wearing body armor killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer, and critically injured a fifth person in a Midtown Manhattan office tower. The suspect, identified as a Las Vegas resident, entered the building on Park Avenue and opened fire in the lobby before moving to an upper floor. Officials reported that the shooter was later found dead from a believed self-inflicted gunshot wound. A motive has not been established, and an investigation into the tragic incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release on bond for those not considered a flight or safety risk. Migrant advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing catastrophic harm to families. The lawsuit contends the change is arbitrary and is already being implemented in immigration courts.</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a more than 8% drop in its stock value after reporting a 59% decline in net profit for the first quarter. The company attributed the sharp decrease to lower interest income and losses from associated companies, including its 25.1% stake in Air India. Despite the profit plunge, the airline noted that demand for air travel remains strong, and it is focused on maintaining its market position through strategic investments and cost discipline. The operating environment remains volatile due to ongoing geopolitical developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, plans to expand its robotaxi service to Dallas, Texas, in 2026, marking another major U.S. market for the company. Waymo has partnered with Avis Budget Group, which will manage the fleet of driverless Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles. The company is already conducting tests in downtown Dallas and aims to offer rides through its app, continuing its push to commercialize autonomous transportation. This expansion places Waymo ahead of competitors in a growing list of cities that includes Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver for a final season of eligibility. The suit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and has caused Wingfield irreparable harm by preventing him from playing and capitalizing on a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity. Wingfield's collegiate career was disrupted by the pandemic and a season-ending injury, factors his legal team believes should have warranted an exemption. The case adds to the growing legal challenges against the NCAA's eligibility regulations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's lackluster reaction to the new U.S.-EU trade deal is due to investors having "tariff ennui" and focusing on more immediate events. He argues that Wall Street is preoccupied with this week's major tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. Cramer believes that until these key events pass, trade policy news is unlikely to significantly move the markets, as investors have become accustomed to the pattern of President Trump's trade negotiations.

          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel has intensely questioned the constitutionality of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) "roving patrol" tactics in Southern California. The hearing follows a lower court's injunction that blocked agents from using race, location, or language as a pretext for detentions, finding it violated the 4th Amendment. The Justice Department is appealing the injunction, but the judges appeared skeptical of the government's arguments, suggesting a potential Supreme Court showdown over the scope of immigration enforcement and protections against unreasonable searches.</p>

          <p>In a landmark case, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and fraud, becoming the first ex-president in the country's history to be convicted of a crime. The court in Bogotá determined that Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, attempted to bribe jailed ex-paramilitaries to prevent them from testifying about his alleged ties to right-wing groups. The highly politicized case, which dates back to 2012, could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years for the divisive but influential conservative leader.</p>

The textile industry is Lesotho's largest private-sector employer, and the tariffs threaten to cripple an economy that had benefited for years from duty-free access to the U.S. market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic analyzes how President Donald Trump's worldview and policy stances, particularly regarding the famine in Gaza, are heavily influenced by what he watches on television. Trump publicly contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims of "no starvation" by citing images of hungry children he saw on the news, stating "you can't fake that." This reliance on TV over intelligence briefings or expert advice makes him susceptible to manipulation but also attunes him to public sentiment. The analysis explores the significant dangers and political implications of this media-driven approach to the presidency.</p>
