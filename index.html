          <p>A family from Oklahoma unearthed a rare 2.79-carat chocolate brown diamond at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas during a birthday trip. Raynae Madison initially thought the stone was too large to be a diamond but park staff confirmed its authenticity, noting its unique inclusions from plastic deformation. Named the William Diamond after her nephew, this marks the third-largest diamond found at the park this year. The park, a volcanic crater, has yielded over 75,000 diamonds since 1906, attracting over 100,000 visitors annually.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony. This development follows President Trump's public calls for prosecutions against Comey and other political adversaries. The charges were brought after Trump replaced a U.S. attorney who expressed doubts about the case with a former defense attorney, despite initial lack of probable cause. Critics view this as an escalation in Trump's campaign to use federal power against perceived foes.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a suicide prevention charity, faces a potential exodus of hundreds of volunteers if plans to close over 100 UK and Ireland branches proceed. The controversial proposals, aiming for a remote working model, are intended to increase call capacity and volunteer recruitment. However, critics argue these changes will decimate local community work and hinder the charity's ability to answer calls, with many volunteers vowing to leave. Opposition has grown, leading some branches to call for a vote of no confidence in the chairman.</p>

          <p>Hollywood is embroiled in a debate over the Israel-Gaza conflict, evidenced by two opposing open letters. Over 5,000 figures, including Pedro Pascal and Selena Gomez, signed a letter pledging to boycott Israeli film groups, alleging their involvement in "genocide and apartheid." Conversely, more than 1,200 others, including Liev Schreiber and Mayim Bialik, signed a letter rejecting the boycott. This counter-letter condemns the boycott as "discriminatory and antisemitic propaganda" and urges for the release of hostages and a stance against Hamas.</p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg's Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), carrying aid to Gaza, reported its radios were hijacked and bombarded for hours with Abba's "Lay All Your Love On Me."

This marks Thunberg's second attempt to deliver aid to Gaza, following a previous deportation. The flotilla aims to break the naval blockade on Gaza, which Israel maintains to prevent weapons smuggling amidst the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <h2>Details Emerge on Trump's Approved TikTok Deal: Ownership and Operational Structure</h2>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed a deal to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to American investors, claiming Chinese President Xi Jinping's approval. The executive order allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new $14 billion entity, with ByteDance owning less than 20%. Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell are named as potential investors. The new American TikTok will use an algorithm retrained on U.S. user data, with "trusted security partners" monitoring software and data flows. This aims to address national security concerns about Chinese government access to data and influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO leaders are increasingly signaling a readiness for potential direct, albeit limited, conflict with Russia following a series of brazen airspace incursions. Incidents include Russian drones entering Polish territory and manned fighter jets violating Estonian airspace. These provocations have prompted strong warnings from NATO officials, with Poland explicitly threatening to shoot down any future unauthorized aircraft. Even President Trump has endorsed NATO countries' right to shoot down Russian aircraft. This shift indicates a growing consensus that the risks of allowing provocations outweigh the risks of responding, despite Russia's warnings of war.</p>

          <p>President Trump formally approved a deal for a consortium of mostly U.S. investors to acquire the short video app TikTok, signing an executive order that green-lights the spinoff. This move aims to prevent a U.S. ban on the app by ensuring it meets "qualified divestiture" standards, proving it is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary. Under the deal, ByteDance will own less than 20% of the new entity, which will be governed by a board focused on protecting American users' privacy and national security concerns. The president credited TikTok with boosting his youth vote in 2024.</p>
