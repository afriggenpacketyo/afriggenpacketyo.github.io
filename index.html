          <h2>Major Earthquake Near Russia Prompts Pacific-Wide Tsunami Alerts</h2>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. The event prompted evacuation orders for millions, although some warnings were later downgraded as the initial waves proved less destructive than feared. Videos showed flooding in the Russian town of Severo-Kurilsk, and authorities reported damage to a port and power grid. Experts noted that the full impact would vary by location and could unfold over many hours as the waves traveled across the ocean.</p>

          <p>Following a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia, tsunami warnings for Hawaii were downgraded to an advisory after relatively small waves reached the islands. While some shoreline flooding was reported and residents were initially urged to evacuate, officials confirmed the peak wave heights had passed without causing substantial damage. The U.S. West Coast and parts of Japan also saw advisories lowered, though authorities continued to caution the public about strong currents and to stay away from coastal areas. The event caused some flight disruptions but resulted in far less impact than initially anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has disclosed that only two law enforcement witnesses, an FBI agent and an NYPD detective, testified before the grand juries investigating Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In a court filing, the DOJ stated that much of this testimony was consistent with accounts later made public during trial. The government proposes unsealing the transcripts with redactions to protect victim-related and personal identifying information. The filing also noted that the DOJ had not initially contacted the victims referenced in the transcripts but has since provided notice to nearly all of them.</p>

          <p>Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson is reportedly ending his training camp holdout and rejoining the team, despite not yet securing a new contract extension. As the last remaining player holding out in the NFL preseason, his return marks a significant development for the team's defense. Hendrickson, who led the league in sacks last season, had been seeking a new deal with more guaranteed money. While an agreement has not been reached, his decision to report to camp is seen as a positive step toward resolving the contract dispute with the organization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the 60th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, this article examines the history of these public health programs and the impact of recent cuts enacted under the Trump administration. It traces the origins of the programs to the civil rights era while also detailing a long history of conservative efforts to reduce their scope. The recent legislation, which cuts over $1 trillion from Medicaid, is described as the largest in the programs' history and is projected to cause millions to lose coverage. The potential closure of hundreds of rural hospitals is also cited as a significant consequence of the funding reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Industry leaders suggest that the regulatory environment in Washington, D.C. has become more favorable toward cryptocurrency and related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under the Trump administration. Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie noted a shift from an antagonistic to a more welcoming attitude from regulators, facilitating innovation in the crypto space. This change is seen as a positive development for firms looking to launch new products, although experts emphasize the need for investor education and regulatory certainty. The recent signing of the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins, is cited as a major legislative step supporting this new direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the United States has fallen by 3.8%, reaching its lowest level since May, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The decline is attributed more to broad economic uncertainty and job market concerns than to interest rates, which have remained relatively stable. Applications for both home purchases and refinancing decreased, with purchase applications dropping 6% for the week. This trend suggests that prospective homebuyers are hesitant to make significant financial commitments in the current economic climate, despite slowing home-price growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep analysis of the social and political movements that erupted after the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. It argues that while the protests represented a massive, justified outcry against racial injustice, the associated unrest and violence prefigured a surge of white grievance and political polarization. The author suggests the events of that summer, and the way lawlessness was sometimes rationalized, created a pattern that was later mirrored by the right, culminating in the January 6th Capitol siege. The piece reflects on how the spectacle of these events has contributed to a deeply fractured American society.</p>

The meeting also takes place amid White House criticism of the central bank and economic data that complicates the decision to delay easing.

          <p>This article examines the work of Lawrence Dennis, a Black intellectual who advocated for fascism in America during the 1930s. Dennis argued that liberalism's emphasis on free markets and individual liberty was structurally incapable of solving the Great Depression, predicting its inevitable collapse. The author draws parallels between Dennis's arguments and those of modern right-wing critics of liberalism, identifying two "anti-liberal traps." The first is overextrapolating from a recent crisis to declare liberalism's doom, and the second is idealizing illiberal alternatives. The piece suggests Dennis's failed predictions should serve as a cautionary tale.</p>

          <p>The women-only dating safety app Tea has suspended its direct messaging feature after a significant data breach exposed user information, including images, posts, and private conversations. The company acknowledged that direct messages were accessed in the hack and is working to identify affected users, to whom it will offer free identity protection services. The app, which has 1.6 million users and allows women to share information about men they date, had previously confirmed the leak of thousands of user-submitted images. Cybersecurity experts have expressed concern, noting the exposed private messages could lead to blackmail or emotional harm.</p>

          <h2>Elon Musk's Political Alignments Are Negatively Impacting Perceptions of All Electric Vehicles Among U.S. Liberals, Study Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that Elon Musk's rightward political turn and alliance with Donald Trump have soured U.S. liberals not only on Tesla but on the entire electric vehicle category. A study published in Nature found that as liberals' opinions of Tesla plummeted, their overall intention to purchase any EV also declined. The researchers suggest Musk has become so synonymous with electric cars that his personal brand has dragged down the appeal of the entire product class for this demographic. Conversely, the study found that Musk's shift did not make conservatives more likely to purchase an EV.</p>

          <p>In its debut season, Major League Soccer's expansion team San Diego FC is achieving historic success with a uniquely risky and possession-based style of play. Coached by Mike Varas, the team is committed to playing out from the back, often using its goalkeeper and young defenders to deliberately attract pressure before launching attacks. This strategy, part of the "Right to Dream" ownership group's philosophy, has resulted in San Diego leading the league in buildup touches and being on pace to become the best expansion side in MLS history. The club has embraced this high-risk, high-reward approach, building a roster of young, technically skilled players.</p>

          <p>This opinion column uses the recent data breach of the women's dating safety app "Tea" as a case study for the broader issue of digital privacy. The author notes that such breaches have become commonplace and questions if anyone's personal information remains truly secure online. The hack is described as particularly nasty, seemingly motivated by misogynistic trolls, and has exposed highly sensitive user data. While acknowledging the ethical complexities of apps like Tea, the piece argues they exist because dating platforms fail to adequately protect women, making the breach of this supposed safe space even more egregious.</p>

          <p>Following the recent cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by CBS, the program is now a contender for a Primetime Emmy Award, creating a potentially dramatic scenario. The awards ceremony is set to be broadcast on CBS, meaning Colbert could accept the award on the very network that canceled his show. The article reflects on Colbert's tenure, his political commentary, and the broader decline of broadcast late-night television. An Emmy win would be the show's first in the main talk series category and would serve as a poignant and likely pointed moment of public theater.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that the collective experience of living through the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a subtle but measurable acceleration in brain aging. Researchers analyzed brain scans taken before and after the pandemic, finding that the cumulative stressors—such as isolation and uncertainty—likely contributed to these changes, even in individuals who never contracted the virus. While physical brain aging was widespread, the study found that only those actually infected with COVID-19 showed small declines in cognitive performance. The effect was more pronounced in older people, men, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.</p>

          <p>Despite a long-standing policy limiting direct cooperation with immigration authorities, the Los Angeles Police Department is indirectly enabling deportations by routinely sharing fingerprint data with federal law enforcement. When individuals are arrested and booked by the LAPD, their data can trigger alerts for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), leading to their tracking and removal, even if no criminal charges are filed. This practice raises concerns among critics and city officials that the spirit of the city's sanctuary policies is being undermined. The issue has gained urgency amid intensified immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A wave of legislative proposals across numerous U.S. states is targeting the use of synthetic food dyes and other chemical additives in food products. This surge in regulatory interest, partly fueled by the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, reflects growing consumer concern and frustration with perceived federal inaction. While some bills have become law, such as those in Arizona and Utah banning certain dyes in school foods, many others have stalled. The food industry has raised concerns about a patchwork of state-by-state rules, arguing that a uniform national standard from the FDA is necessary.</p>
