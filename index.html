          <p>Detroit Lions cornerback Ennis Rakestraw Jr. has publicly requested an end to the negative social media messages he has received since suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. The 23-year-old rookie, a second-round draft pick, underwent surgery after being injured in a tackling drill and was subsequently placed on injured reserve. Despite initially posting a positive message about his faith and apologizing to the city, he later pleaded for fans to stop direct messaging him with speculation that he would be cut from the team. Lions head coach Dan Campbell expressed his sympathy for the young player, calling the situation a "tough deal" for the promising athlete.</p>

          <p>Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated there will be "no invasion" of Mexican territory following reports that the Trump administration authorized the U.S. military to target drug cartels. While acknowledging she was informed about the executive order, Sheinbaum emphasized that any U.S. action must respect Mexico's sovereignty, advocating for collaboration rather than intervention. The statement comes after several Latin American drug trafficking groups were designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the U.S., a move Secretary of State Marco Rubio said allows for the use of American intelligence and military power against them. This development highlights the diplomatic tensions surrounding U.S. counter-narcotics strategy in the region.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO documentary 'Chimp Crazy,' has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison for perjury and obstructing justice. The charges stemmed from a PETA lawsuit over the poor conditions in which she kept several chimpanzees, including one named Tonka who had appeared in films. Haddix falsely claimed Tonka had died to avoid surrendering him to a sanctuary as ordered by a court. Authorities later discovered the chimp alive in a cage in her basement, and another chimp was found there just last month, leading to her arrest and bond revocation.</p>

          <p>As bankruptcy filings rise amid economic pressures, it is crucial for individuals to understand the factors that could disqualify them from seeking this form of debt relief. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, disqualifiers include failing the income-based means test, having a recent bankruptcy discharge, and failing to complete mandatory credit counseling. Fraudulent behavior, such as concealing assets or lying on forms, will also lead to rejection and potential criminal charges. If disqualified, alternative options for managing debt include debt consolidation loans, negotiating debt settlements with creditors, or enrolling in a formal debt management program with a credit counseling agency.

          <p>Pakistan's military announced that its security forces killed 33 militants in an overnight operation as they attempted to cross into the country from Afghanistan. The engagement occurred in the Zhob district of Balochistan province, targeting fighters the government identifies as belonging to the Pakistani Taliban. The military described the insurgents as "Indian-sponsored," a claim that both India and Afghanistan's Taliban government deny, continuing a pattern of regional accusations. In a related security measure, the Balochistan government has suspended mobile internet services throughout the region until the end of August amid ongoing violence from separatist and militant groups.</p>

Lovell became a symbol of courage and resilience after the 1970 lunar mission suffered a critical oxygen tank explosion, forcing the crew to abort their moon landing. His leadership was instrumental in navigating the crippled spacecraft safely back to Earth, turning a potential catastrophe into what became known as a "successful failure." Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy praised Lovell's steadfast character, stating that he inspired millions and that his handling of the crisis provided invaluable lessons for the space program.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats once again broke quorum on Friday, preventing a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly favor the GOP in congressional elections. Despite threats of arrest and loss of pay from Governor Greg Abbott, the majority of Democrats remained absent from the special session. Democratic leaders have indicated they may stay away until the session ends, but would return if Republicans agree to focus on other pressing issues. The standoff has escalated, with the governor seeking to remove the House minority leader from office and the state attorney general threatening legal action to compel the absent lawmakers' return.</p>

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, credited AI with improving the efficiency of the company's ad system, contributing to a 22% year-over-year sales increase. In contrast, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap's growth hampered by a botched ad platform update. The trend suggests that during times of economic uncertainty, advertisers are gravitating toward the larger, more stable platforms whose AI-driven tools offer more reliable returns.

Hundreds of firefighters worked through the night, making significant progress to contain 25% of the fire's perimeter by Friday morning. While no homes have been destroyed, the situation remains precarious as extreme heat is expected to continue, elevating wildfire risk across much of inland California through the weekend.</p>

          <p>Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan addressed what he called "misinformation" in a memo to employees after President Donald Trump demanded his immediate resignation and raised ethical concerns. The president's criticism, echoed by Senator Tom Cotton, centered on Tan's past connections to Chinese companies and potential security risks. In his letter, Tan defended his 40-year career, stating he has always operated with the highest ethical standards and is working with the White House to resolve the situation. He affirmed his support for U.S. national security and noted that Intel's board remains fully supportive of his leadership and the company's direction.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced a significant weekly gain, rising about 13% after the company committed to a $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, easing investor fears over potential tariffs from the Trump administration. This reversal of fortune has pushed the stock to its highest level since April. In other market news, The Wall Street Journal reports the Trump administration is planning a historic stock offering for government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The potential deal, which could value the companies at over $500 billion, is being discussed with leaders of major banks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

Her husband, Simon, testified that he suffered three near-death experiences from food she prepared in 2021 and 2022, one of which left him in a coma. This evidence was not presented to the jury that convicted her of killing three relatives and attempting to kill a fourth at a family lunch in 2023.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed that the University of California system pay over $1 billion to settle federal charges of antisemitism at UCLA. According to sources, the proposal includes a massive fine and a $172 million contribution to a fund for affected Jewish students. This demand is a condition for restoring $584 million in frozen federal research grants to the university. The proposal follows similar settlements with Ivy League universities, but California Governor Gavin Newsom has urged UC leaders not to bend to the administration's pressure, vowing to fight against such an agreement and defending the university's principles.</p>

          <p>New York City's medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, more than two decades after their deaths. The victims were identified as Ryan D. Fitzgerald, 26, Barbara A. Keating, 72, and another woman whose name is being withheld at her family's request. The identifications were made possible by advances in DNA testing technology applied to remains recovered from the World Trade Center wreckage in 2001 and 2002. This ongoing effort provides long-awaited answers to families, though approximately 1,100 of the 2,753 victims from the New York attack remain unidentified.</p>

          <p>Five years after the largest protests in Belarus's history erupted against the rigged 2020 presidential election, the country remains firmly under the autocratic rule of Alexander Lukashenko. The regime, backed by Russia, has systematically erased digital and physical traces of the uprising while intensifying its crackdown on dissent, with thousands prosecuted for political reasons. Despite the release of some political prisoners, human rights groups report that detentions continue for minor offenses like liking "extremist" content online. Analysts suggest that without significant Western leverage or a shift in Russia's support, the prospects for democratic change in Belarus remain dim.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire raging in the Keratea region, southeast of Athens, has resulted in the death of one elderly man and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents. The man's body was discovered inside his home in an area affected by the blaze, which spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions. Authorities have issued emergency alerts for seven areas, with police assisting in evacuations as the fire destroyed homes and crossed into residential neighborhoods. With over 50 fires breaking out across Greece in 24 hours, firefighting efforts are strained, and the risk of further outbreaks remains severe.</p>

Bhim Kohli was fatally assaulted by a 14-year-old boy in September, two weeks after he had witnessed another racist attack on an Asian man in the same park. A police report revealed that officers had identified the perpetrators of the first assault but failed to arrest them until after Mr. Kohli's death, citing shift patterns and a bank holiday. His daughter, Susan Kohli, believes swifter police action could have deterred further violence and is calling for a new review by the police watchdog.</p>

          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is unlikely to derail long-delayed free trade negotiations between the EU and India, according to experts. The EU's move targets Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, as part of its effort to cut funding for the war in Ukraine. However, analysts argue the designation is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from the U.S. threat of high tariffs. This American pressure may paradoxically increase India's desire to secure a stable trade agreement with the EU, strengthening Brussels' negotiating position.</p>

The 36-year-old suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder during the recent Test against India but still bravely came out to bat in a sling during England's narrow run chase. While surgery would likely mean a three-to-four-month recovery that clashes with the Ashes timeline, a rehab-focused approach could have him ready in about eight weeks.
