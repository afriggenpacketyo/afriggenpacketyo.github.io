            <p>A Los Angeles court ruled in favor of Sony, granting them the right to take over the distribution of "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" from CBS. Sony had accused CBS of breaching their contract by entering into unauthorized licensing agreements and undervaluing the shows. The judge determined that Sony had the right to terminate the distribution agreements, though CBS plans to appeal the decision, arguing that the ruling was preliminary and based on incomplete evidence. The outcome of this case will determine who profits from these highly successful and long running game shows.</p>

Recent amendments to China’s Supervision Law have increased anxiety by potentially denying legal help to those detained for investigation for up to 16 months. President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, now in its second decade, shows no signs of slowing down. This has prompted some officials to seek legal advice to prepare for potential scrutiny.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Boston has extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to countries other than their own. The judge expressed concerns about the policy's impact on migrants' safety, suggesting that they lack a meaningful way to raise concerns about their safety when they are deported. The judge's decision highlights the ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies. The court is considering a preliminary injunction which has the potential to stall the frequently used deportation approach taken by the Trump administration.</p>
