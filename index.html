          <p>As it turns twenty, Reddit is navigating the threat posed by artificial intelligence, which scrapes its vast user-generated content for training models. The company is actively defending its data, highlighted by a recent lawsuit against AI firm Anthropic for alleged unlawful data scraping. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging AI for its own benefit, launching "Reddit Answers," a tool that generates responses based solely on Reddit conversations and directs users to the original discussions. This dual strategy aims to protect the value of its unique human-generated content while adapting to the new technological landscape and enhancing user experience.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Kyiv, declaring that supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia is the most critical task of Germany's foreign and security policy. Amid intensified Russian bombardments, Wadephul pledged continued military, humanitarian, and economic aid, emphasizing that Russian President Putin seeks capitulation, not negotiation. While Germany remains a top supporter, it still withholds long-range Taurus missiles, instead planning to help Ukraine develop its own independent long-range capabilities. The visit underscores Germany's commitment as European allies work to compensate for uncertain U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Stuart Burrows, a celebrated Welsh operatic tenor renowned for his performances on the world's most prestigious stages, has passed away at the age of 92. Beginning his career with the Welsh National Opera in 1963, he went on to achieve international fame, singing at venues like La Scala in Milan and the Metropolitan Opera in New York for 12 seasons. Burrows, who turned down a professional rugby career for music, was particularly acclaimed as one of the greatest Mozart tenors of his generation and was honored with an OBE in 2007 for his services to music.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, cutting tariffs on key exports like British cars and aerospace products. In exchange, the UK has eliminated tariffs on U.S. beef and ethanol, a move that has drawn criticism from the domestic bioethanol industry. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% U.S. tariff, which could double to 50% if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline, creating major uncertainty for British producers.</p>

Crime analysts suggest the primary driver for both the rise and fall of violence was the pandemic's disruption of daily life and social services. As public services, community programs, and local government employment return to pre-pandemic levels, support systems for at-risk youth are being restored. This, combined with community violence intervention programs, is credited with helping to interrupt cycles of violence and reduce murders nationwide.</p>

While some tip to reward service or supplement low wages, many now feel obligated by the technology's design, which can make it awkward to opt out, leading to customer irritation and changing social norms around gratuity.</p>

The footwear, which closely resembles traditional Kolhapuri sandals from Maharashtra, was showcased at Milan Fashion Week without crediting its roots, sparking backlash in India. In response, Prada stated it is now in contact with an Indian industry body and is open to dialogue with local artisans. Kolhapuri sandals, which trace their history to the 12th century, were granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag by the Indian government in 2019.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that for decades following World War II, Adolf Hitler served as the ultimate moral reference point, unifying the Western world around a consensus against his evil. The author contends that this "age of Hitler," which shaped fundamental values like human rights and equality, is now ending as the war recedes from living memory. With the rise of political movements on both the right and left that challenge these post-war taboos, including a resurgence of antisemitism, the stable moral landscape defined by a shared condemnation of Nazism is becoming increasingly fragile.</p>

While this marks a significant expansion of recognition, the certificates are not legally binding and do not grant same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexual couples, such as inheritance or co-parenting rights. Japan remains the only G7 nation that has not legalized same-sex marriage, a situation currently being challenged in courts across the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to release details of major concessions to its proposed welfare reforms in an effort to prevent a rebellion from its own MPs. After more than 120 Labour backbenchers threatened to oppose the bill, the prime minister agreed to limit cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and reversed a planned freeze on the health component of Universal Credit. Despite these changes, which reduce the projected savings, dozens of MPs still have misgivings about the bill's impact on vulnerable people and may vote against it.</p>

The content, which ranges from manipulative dating advice to outright hatred, hooks young users and draws them into a parallel world of toxic ideology.
