          <p>The Bank of Russia has reduced interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, indicating that inflation pressures are subsiding. This decision follows a period of high inflation triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which significantly strained prices and weakened the ruble. The central bank had maintained rates at 21% since October 2024, the highest level since 2013. April's inflation rate was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the first quarter's average of 8.2%.

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether the sexual orientation of Jonathan Joss, best known as the voice of John Redcorn on "King of the Hill," played a role in his fatal shooting. Joss's husband alleges the shooter yelled homophobic slurs before opening fire, but initial police statements found no evidence of a hate crime. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus has since retracted that statement, acknowledging that it was made prematurely and that the investigation is ongoing. Friends and colleagues, including Chris Pratt and Nick Offerman, have paid tribute to Joss, who also had a recurring role on "Parks and Recreation."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's criticisms of President Trump's tax bill have created a headache for the president and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. Trump is seeking a legislative win before the Fourth of July, but Musk's opposition is complicating matters. The bill addresses issues such as raising the debt ceiling and making the Trump tax cuts permanent. Musk has branded the bill a "disgusting abomination" and has even called for Trump's impeachment.</p>
