          <p>A driver in south Wales, Anthony Tregonning, has been sentenced to prison after a 130mph police chase ended with him striking and severely injuring a road worker, Ieuan Parry. Tregonning initially reported his modified Mitsubishi Evo as stolen and attempted to blame his ex-partner, but Ring doorbell footage proved he was driving the car at the time of the incident. Mr. Parry suffered life-altering injuries, including the amputation of his leg, while Tregonning admitted to fleeing because the high-powered car was uninsured. The case highlights the crucial role of modern surveillance technology in contradicting false claims and securing justice for victims of reckless driving.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the career site Indeed suggests that generative artificial intelligence is set to "radically transform" approximately 26% of jobs in the U.S. market. The roles most exposed to this disruption are white-collar positions in sectors like technology and finance, where AI can supplant cognitive reasoning tasks. In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as nursing and construction, are considered more insulated from the current capabilities of gen AI. While some companies have already announced AI-related workforce reductions, experts note the overall impact on the labor market remains limited for now, with most applications augmenting rather than fully automating human roles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend known as "locking in" is gaining popularity among Gen Z, characterized by periods of intense focus on personal goals, often documented on social media platforms like TikTok. This phenomenon, rooted in sports and gaming culture, involves eliminating distractions to achieve self-improvement in areas like fitness, finance, or personal projects. Analysts view it as a reaction against the constant digital stimulation of the pandemic era and a coping mechanism for navigating economic anxieties, such as the rise of AI and a competitive job market. While it reflects a desire for productivity and control, some critics question if this endless cycle of self-improvement comes at the expense of genuine social connection and fun.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has approved a proposal to prohibit the use of terms like "burger," "sausage," or "steak" for marketing plant-based food alternatives. Proponents, primarily from the center-right EPP group, argue this measure prevents consumer confusion and protects Europe's culinary traditions and farmers. However, the move has faced significant backlash from Green party members, consumer protection groups, and major supermarkets, who contend that labels like "veggie burger" are clear and help shoppers navigate their choices. The final decision on whether the ban will be implemented now rests with the EU's heads of state and government.</p>

Governor Pritzker has called on Governor Abbott to withdraw his support for the decision, framing it as an inappropriate use of military troops against American citizens. The situation highlights escalating tensions between state and federal authorities over law enforcement and jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating James Comey for allegedly making false statements to Congress reportedly found their own central witness to be "problematic," according to sources familiar with the matter. The witness, law professor Daniel Richman, allegedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information anonymously and, on some occasions, advised him against speaking to the press. This testimony is said to create "insurmountable problems" for the prosecution, as detailed in an internal memo that recommended against charging the former FBI director. Despite these internal warnings and concerns from career staff, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney proceeded with the indictment, raising questions about the case's viability and political motivations.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is creating far-reaching negative impacts on the commercial real estate market, extending beyond the immediate effects on residential home sales. The shutdown halts the release of crucial economic data, such as employment and construction reports, which investors rely on to make informed decisions. This uncertainty leads to tighter credit conditions, delayed project approvals, and reduced investor confidence. Sectors like retail and hospitality face immediate pullbacks in consumer spending, particularly in areas with a high concentration of federal workers, while deals involving government agencies, such as GSA leases or HUD financing, are stalled indefinitely.

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) warned that the move threatens to inflate costs and disrupt supply chains, arguing that it goes too far in protecting one industry at the expense of another.

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, has stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially labeling China a "threat to national security." This designation became a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in another spying case. Despite months of requests from the Crown Prosecution Service, government witness statements did not meet this standard, leading to the charges being dropped. The unusual public explanation from the DPP follows criticism from politicians and speculation that the government may have been reluctant to make such a direct and diplomatically sensitive declaration against Beijing.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the deployment of the National Guard and federal law enforcement to cities like Chicago and Memphis is not a sustainable solution to crime but rather an admission of systemic failure. The author contends that years of political decisions, including budget cuts and bureaucratic hiring processes, have dangerously depleted local police forces, creating the vacancies that troops are now being sent to fill. Instead of relying on temporary military surges, the piece calls for modernizing police recruitment with better technology and investing in building robust, professional local departments. The author warns that lowering hiring standards is a dangerous gamble and that the presence of soldiers on city streets is a last resort that should signal an urgent need for reform.</p>

Now free from the burden of captaincy, which he held on the two previous tours, Root feels he has a better understanding of his game for Australian conditions.

          <p>Overall mortgage application volume has declined, but a notable trend has emerged among remaining borrowers who are increasingly opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower interest rates. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the share of ARM applications rose as the interest rate differential between them and 30-year fixed-rate loans approached a full percentage point. While total demand for both refinancing and home purchase loans fell, the shift towards ARMs indicates that homebuyers and refinancers are willing to take on more risk in a high-rate environment.

          <p>Preordering a book provides a significant and disproportionate benefit to authors, influencing the book's entire launch trajectory. Strong preorder numbers signal to booksellers that a title has high demand, which can lead to better placement in stores and online, as well as larger initial stock orders. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which dramatically increases the likelihood of a book debuting on a bestseller list. This initial success creates a snowball effect, generating more visibility and subsequent sales. This dynamic highlights how early consumer support can be a crucial factor in the competitive publishing landscape.</p>

          <p>As former FBI Director James Comey faces charges of perjury and obstruction, this article provides context on his career and the events leading to his indictment. The charges stem from his 2020 congressional testimony regarding the FBI's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton and Russian election interference. The indictment, which came shortly after public pressure from President Donald Trump, accuses Comey of misleading Congress about authorizing leaks to the media. The case revisits a contentious period, including Comey's controversial handling of the Clinton email probe and his subsequent firing by Trump, which led to the appointment of a special counsel for the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>Mexican military prosecutors have opened an investigation into a group of soldiers involved in the fatal shooting of six civilians in the northern state of Tamaulipas. The incident occurred when a pickup truck allegedly tried to ram an army vehicle on a highway in the region, which is known for frequent and violent drug cartel activity. According to a defense ministry statement, the soldiers perceived a threat and opened fire. This event adds to a history of violent clashes in Tamaulipas involving security forces that have led to accusations of extrajudicial killings. The soldiers involved are currently being investigated by the attorney general's office.</p>

          <p>Wharton School professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick has cautioned against putting too much faith in predictions about artificial intelligence's impact on the job market, bluntly stating, "no one knows anything." Speaking at a CNBC summit, Mollick emphasized that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects. He urged business leaders, particularly in human resources, to move beyond theoretical task forces and instead encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT. His primary advice is for individuals and leaders to actively use the technology themselves to understand its capabilities and limitations, arguing that this direct experience is the only way to discover practical applications.</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has resulted in the deaths of at least 24 people and injured 47 others who were gathered for a peaceful protest at a Buddhist festival. The army reportedly used a motorized paraglider to drop two bombs on the crowd in the Chaung U township, located in the key resistance area of the Sagaing region. This incident is part of an increasingly brutal campaign of airstrikes by the military junta, which is facing armed resistance across the country since its 2021 coup. Rights groups like Amnesty International have noted the junta's growing use of paramotors as a disturbing trend in its war against opposition forces.</p>

The style, which flourished in the early 20th century as a reaction against industrial mass production, is finding new relevance today as people seek well-made, authentic, and nature-connected living spaces. The event celebrates both iconic works by architects like Greene and Greene and the more modest, bespoke bungalows that define many of the city's neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law, Assembly Bill 628, that will mandate California landlords to include a working refrigerator and stove in their rental properties. Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from "amenities" to essential "standard characteristics" required for a unit to be considered habitable. The law aims to alleviate the financial burden on tenants, who often have to purchase these costly appliances themselves on top of paying first month's rent and a security deposit. The new requirement will apply to all new leases starting on or after January 1, 2026.</p>

When pressed with follow-up questions, Porter expressed frustration, called the line of questioning "unnecessarily argumentative," and stated, "I don’t want this all on camera," before ending that portion of the interview.
