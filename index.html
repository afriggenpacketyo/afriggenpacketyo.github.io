          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced plans to shift its primary listing to the U.S., a significant loss for the London Stock Exchange. The company intends to implement a dual listing, with the main hub moving to the U.S. while retaining a secondary listing in London. This strategic move would enable Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. The company's earnings announcement highlighted that this would allow greater access to capital markets and a broader investor base, but the full implications of this decision for the London market are still unfolding. </p>

          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar met with his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, in Berlin, following Germany's promise to increase arms shipments to Israel despite international calls for an embargo. The diplomats began with a wreath-laying ceremony at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, commemorating Jewish persecution during the Nazi regime. Human rights groups organized a protest in front of the Foreign Ministry, denouncing Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip. Wadephul's commitment to more arms deliveries contrasts with earlier suggestions that such shipments depended on a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban has diminished hopes for sanctuary in the United States for people in war-torn countries such as Afghanistan and Myanmar. The order restricts travel from nationals of specific countries, citing national security risks, which has led to increased difficulties for those seeking refuge. This ban follows similar measures taken during Trump's first term, which faced legal challenges and widespread criticism. The policy's impact on vulnerable populations seeking asylum highlights the human cost of stricter immigration policies and the challenges faced by those fleeing conflict and instability.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have experienced a significant decline in U.S. demand due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Data indicates a substantial drop in daily and monthly active users for both platforms, coupled with a decline in their Apple App Store rankings. This downturn coincides with a reduction in advertising spending by Temu and Shein in the U.S. market following the tariff announcements. The shift in trade policy has evidently impacted consumer behavior and the competitive landscape for these low-cost e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic alliance with China and India as a counterweight to the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to existing distrust between the two Asian powers.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in 'anti-China' initiatives and reaffirmed Moscow's hope for restoring the Russia-India-China framework. The border dispute between China and India had largely frozen bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year.</p>

The German Association of the Automotive Industry has warned that these restrictions could halt production.

This deployment raises legal questions about the role of the military in domestic law enforcement. The military's presence aims to deter illegal crossings and combat drug trafficking, but critics argue that it blurs the lines between military and police functions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into former President Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging a 'conspiracy' to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump is questioning the use of an autopen by Biden's aides to sign executive actions, claiming the public was shielded from knowing who wielded executive power. Biden, who is battling advanced prostate cancer, has dismissed Trump's claims as 'ridiculous and false.' The inquiry intensifies scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity, particularly following accusations of a cover-up during his re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition with its solar panels, creating a model for the Global South, but a Chinese energy scholar questions the financial viability. The report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants in Pakistan and its solar panel exports, as both cannot succeed in the same market. It emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing to counter rising trade tensions and export restrictions on critical minerals. The influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for coal-fired plants, potentially leading to stranded assets.</p>

          <p>Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor, argues that President Trump's tariffs disrupt the global trading system and weaken economic ties essential for international stability. The constant threat of tariffs undermines trade and damages international relations by disregarding free trade agreements and WTO rules. Prasad warns that denying low-income countries trade opportunities could increase migration, while higher prices and limited choices due to tariffs may cause political discontent. Ultimately, these policies are expected to make the world poorer and more dangerous.</p>
