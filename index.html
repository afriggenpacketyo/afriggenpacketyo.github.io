          <p>A crew of four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from Japan, and one from Russia, successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean in a SpaceX capsule. This marked NASA's first Pacific splashdown in 50 years. The mission was notable for relieving two other astronauts who had been stranded on the ISS for nine months due to issues with their Boeing Starliner capsule. The returning crew spent 146 days in space, with NASA and SpaceX officials praising the successful mission and recovery operation.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York's Times Square early Saturday morning left three people injured, including a 19-year-old man who was the intended target and two bystanders. The incident reportedly stemmed from a fight that began inside a restaurant involving a group of teenagers. Police responded quickly to the sound of gunshots and arrested a 17-year-old suspect after a short chase, recovering a firearm from the scene. The victims were hospitalized in stable condition, and the suspect faces multiple charges, including attempted murder.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a major boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown due to several economic pressures. Factors contributing to the decline include changing consumer habits, post-pandemic inflation, and the impact of global tariffs, particularly from the EU and Canada. The downturn has led to falling sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey, and even caused some smaller distilleries to file for bankruptcy. Analysts warn that an oversupply from previous years' predictions means the industry may face further consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable portfolio of patents derived from federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal obligations and initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action is viewed by many as part of a broader White House pressure campaign against the university, which has been accused of civil rights violations related to campus protests.</p>

          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise stress relief and other health benefits is facing scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. Experts are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane mushroom or L-theanine in these drinks can produce their advertised calming effects. While some consumers find them to be a good alternative to alcohol for unwinding, one psychologist suggests the perceived benefits may stem from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself rather than the ingredients. An ad by a leading brand was recently banned for making unsubstantiated health claims.</p>

The massive Rubí and Clemesí solar plants generate enough power for hundreds of thousands of homes, yet the village itself is not connected to the national grid. While the plant's operator says it has funded the infrastructure to connect the village, the final step of wiring individual homes remains the government's responsibility and has been delayed.

While some criticized him, many, particularly those of second-generation Irish heritage, defended his connection, citing his Irish grandparents, passport, and formative musical influences. The discussion explores the complex, evolving nature of what it means to be Irish, which can encompass heritage, cultural affinity, and personal feeling, rather than being strictly defined by birthplace.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his nomination of Tammy Bruce, the current State Department spokesperson, to serve as the U.S. deputy representative to the United Nations. Bruce, a former long-time Fox News commentator and radio host, had no prior foreign policy experience before her appointment as spokesperson earlier this year. The nomination of Bruce, who is also known for her conservative views and opposition to transgender rights, places a former media personality in a key diplomatic role.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Why NASA's Mars Rovers Frequently Get Stuck in Alien Soil</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 18:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have finally determined why robotic rovers on the Moon and Mars get stuck so often: previous simulations failed to account for how low gravity affects the soil itself. A new study using physics-based simulations revealed that sand and dust on low-gravity bodies is fluffier and shifts more easily, reducing traction and making it much easier for wheels to become embedded. This insight, which considers the gravitational effects on both the rover and the terrain, could be crucial for designing more effective rovers for future space exploration missions.</p>

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's recent atomic bomb commemoration ceremonies in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time is testing the delicate, improving relationship between China and Japan. Lee Yi-yang, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, attended the events as part of Taiwan's broader effort to strengthen unofficial ties and raise its international profile. While Beijing is expected to view the participation negatively, observers believe both nations will proceed cautiously to avoid undermining their recent diplomatic progress.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals upon receiving a custodial sentence for a crime. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be removed right away, with their home country deciding whether they serve any prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayer money and protect the public, though it would not apply to those with life sentences. Critics have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the pomegranate as a particularly beneficial fruit for supporting healthy brain aging in people over 50. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and neuroprotective effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein buildup associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is a year-round alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugar.</p>
