          <p>House Republicans are engaged in intense discussions to finalize agreements on the budget bill, focusing on three key areas: green energy tax credits, Medicaid work requirements, and the SALT deduction. Prospective deals are expected to be informal agreements. The "SALT caucus" seeks a compromise that grants a higher deduction initially, gradually reducing it over ten years. The White House is exploring a "manager’s amendment" for implementing potential changes. The GOP leadership is optimistic about reaching an agreement, aiming to post the bill's text early this week and hold a vote on Thursday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal and New York City officials have initiated an investigation into the crash of a Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two fatalities and numerous injuries. The ship, departing from the South Street Seaport, reportedly lost power and drifted backward, colliding with the bridge, snapping its masts and leaving sailors dangling. Senator Schumer has questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have contributed to the incident, particularly regarding the functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service. While the bridge's structure remains intact, damage was sustained by a monitoring system.</p>

Ukraine's air force reported launching 273 drones by 08:00 Sunday, targeting the central Kyiv region, and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east. The attack comes after Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years on Friday in Turkey, agreeing to a new prisoner swap deal but little else.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reshaping foreign policy in the Middle East, moving ahead without Israel on issues like Iran, Gaza, Syria, and Yemen. Trump shook hands with Syria’s new leader and promised to lift sanctions, a move that disregards Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's views. While the U.S. maintains ties with Israel, Trump's focus has shifted towards negotiating deals in the Gulf States. This change in diplomatic fortunes has been hard to miss, with Trump taking action on one issue after another without involving Netanyahu.</p>

          <h2>Rubio Criticizes Intelligence Community's Assessment of Tren de Aragua</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 11:24:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of Nicolás Maduro's government. Rubio cited an FBI assessment indicating the gang is exported by the Venezuelan regime and has been operationalized to target opposition members. The question of Maduro's control over Tren de Aragua is central to the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. Rubio stated that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged the gang to leave the country and cooperates with them.</p>
