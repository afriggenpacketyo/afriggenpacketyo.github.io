            <p>German police launched a manhunt on Easter Sunday for the shooter(s) responsible for the deaths of two Turkish nationals in Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt. The victims, a 59-year-old man and his 28-year-old son-in-law, were killed at a residential address, and police suspect a personal motive was involved. Authorities believe there is no danger to the public, and special forces were involved in the initial response, though two men initially arrested were later released. The local government expressed condolences to the victims' families, emphasizing Easter as a symbol of hope and renewal.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry found that an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF claimed troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces due to poor night visibility and the commander perceiving an immediate threat. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone, and the IDF stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, though evidence was not provided.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could cause an "artificially high" level of economic activity due to preemptive purchasing and stockpiling of inventory by businesses and consumers. Goolsbee warns that this surge could be followed by a slowdown in the summer as demand is exhausted. He noted that sectors like the auto industry are likely to heavily stock up on inventory before tariffs potentially rise further, creating uncertainty in the short term. Despite these concerns, Goolsbee remains optimistic about the country's longer-term economic outlook.</p>

The truce, proposed by Putin, was intended to halt hostilities from Saturday afternoon to Sunday night, but both sides claim the other failed to adhere to it.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen defended his trip to El Salvador to meet Kilmar Ábrego García, stating it was to support Ábrego García's right to due process, which he believes is essential for all Americans. The White House claims Ábrego García is a member of MS-13, but has presented no evidence in federal court. Van Hollen accused administration officials of lying to distract from questions about the violation of his rights. He emphasized that his goal was to ensure García was okay and that his family knew he was alive.</p>

This perspective reflects a broader agreement between Trump and market principles on the value of attracting affluent individuals to the country.</p>
