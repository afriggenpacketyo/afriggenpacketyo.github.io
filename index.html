          <p>Senator Mike Lee of Utah reportedly posted and then deleted a fake letter on social media that falsely claimed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was resigning. The fabricated document, which featured a distorted Fed seal and unusual formatting, was shared with the caption "Powell's out!" before being removed. Lee later stated he deleted the post out of caution, as he was unsure of the letter's authenticity. The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the fake letter, which circulated amidst President Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell and calls for lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recently passed bill has established a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), set to be available by July 2026. This income-driven plan will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum payment. Unlike some existing plans, it does not shield a portion of income from calculations and extends the loan forgiveness timeline to 30 years. As other repayment options are phased out, RAP may become the primary choice for new borrowers, offering some benefits like subsidies for those not reducing principal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man from Holmdel, New Jersey, has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated criminal enterprise that stole and trafficked catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in revenue. The defendant admitted to conspiring to purchase stolen converters from multiple states and selling them to a metal refinery for the extraction of precious metals like platinum and rhodium. The nationwide scheme was uncovered following a traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2021. The man now faces a potential prison sentence of over 14 years for conspiracy and money laundering charges.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, U.S.-based AI startups secured a remarkable $104.3 billion in venture funding, nearly matching the total for all of 2024, with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic leading the charge. Despite this influx of capital, the market for exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized from 281 deals. The trend shows a pattern of frequent, but lower-value, "bolt-on" acquisitions by larger companies rather than high-value public offerings. Analysts suggest this dynamic reflects current macroeconomic conditions, though the investor appetite for AI applications remains strong. (not investment advice)</p>

The state fire marshal is leading the probe into the July 1st blast in Esparto.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic suggests President Donald Trump's posting habits on Truth Social have become increasingly unusual, particularly in response to the controversy surrounding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. Over a recent weekend, Trump engaged in a posting spree that included demands for sports teams to revert to old names and sharing bizarre, AI-generated, and context-free videos. The article posits that this behavior, resembling that of a "Facebook Uncle," may be a sign of a president feeling defensive and lashing out.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the U.S. will likely extend its suspension of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods, with a formal agreement expected during upcoming talks in Stockholm. The current 90-day tariff truce, which began in mid-May, is set to expire on August 12. Bessent expressed optimism about the trade relationship, stating it is in a "very good place" and has moved to a more constructive level. Beyond trade, the U.S. also hopes to discuss China's manufacturing output, its purchase of sanctioned oil, and its role in the war in Ukraine during the meetings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism from China hawks in Washington for approving the sale of Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. The sale of this specific chip, designed to comply with earlier export restrictions, was initially banned in April but was rescinded as part of a broader trade deal in June that also secured U.S. access to Chinese rare earth minerals. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, arguing it keeps China's developers dependent on American technology. However, critics are questioning the decision, highlighting an apparent inconsistency in previous statements from officials who had denied any "quid pro quo" involving chips for minerals.

CHIRLA's executive director called the operations a "surgical attack meant to provoke panic" and accused the administration of blatant racial profiling.

This stance breaks with the general Wall Street consensus, which largely favors Powell serving out his term.
