            <p>The U.S. Naval Academy canceled a planned speech by podcaster and author Ryan Holiday, citing concerns over political content inappropriate for young naval officers. Holiday, known for his work on stoicism, intended to discuss the pursuit of wisdom with the midshipmen, but the Navy took issue with his inclusion of a reference to the academy's decision to remove books from its library following President Trump's order to eliminate 'un-American' theories. Holiday defended his right to academic independence, arguing the Navy hadn't provided guidance beforehand and that discussing current events shouldn't be off-limits. The Navy maintained its focus on apolitical development of midshipmen, emphasizing its commitment to cultivating honorable leaders.</p>

            <p>Ocado has issued an apology to Mumsnet for citing 'hateful political views' when withdrawing from a commercial partnership. The controversy arose after Mumsnet advocated for reforming the Equality Act to protect single-sex spaces for biological women, leading to several advertisers pulling their support from the parenting forum. Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts expressed concerns about the site's survival due to the advertising withdrawals, especially in light of discussions around gender issues. Ocado clarified that the comment was made by a temporary contractor who has since left the company, emphasizing that the views were not representative of Ocado's values.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued a late-night order preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants without due process. This order suggests a possible shift in the Court's tolerance of the administration's procedural tactics aimed at evading judicial review. The ACLU argued that the government was attempting to defy a previous Supreme Court order requiring notice and an opportunity to challenge removal. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, but the majority's decision indicates a potential limit to the Court's willingness to tolerate 'malicious half-compliance' with its rulings.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point amid concerns over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and increasing pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative about his economic policies. The public also disapproves of his handling of inflation and federal spending, although his approval remains high on immigration issues. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a 'new color,' dubbed 'olo,' through laser stimulation of specific cells in the retina. This saturated shade of blue-green cannot be seen by the naked eye without specialized equipment. Researchers fired laser pulses into the eyes of participants, stimulating M cones in a way that doesn't occur naturally. Some experts, however, argue that the perception of a new color is open to interpretation. The research team hopes to explore the potential implications of this discovery for individuals with color blindness.</p>
