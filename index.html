          <p>Two individuals were rescued after a private Piper PA-32 plane crashed into the Long Island Sound near the Tweed New Haven Airport in Connecticut. The incident occurred around 10:30 a.m. south of the airport, prompting a response from the U.S. Coast Guard, who dispatched a 45-foot boat to the scene. Both occupants were reported to be in stable condition and were taken to Stony Creek Pier in Branford for medical care.

          <p>Reports indicate that 31 people were killed and over 150 injured by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to Hamas-run health authorities and medics. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deny these claims, stating that an initial inquiry found no evidence of its forces firing at Gazans near or within aid points. Doctors at Nasser hospital reported receiving approximately 200 people with bullet or shrapnel wounds, while the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the aid provider, denies any incident occurred near its centers. An IDF soldier claimed soldiers fired near the crowd, but not at them, blaming Hamas for undermining food distribution efforts. The conflicting accounts highlight the complex and dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. </p>

Currently, prison officers in adult male prisons only carry an extendable baton and Pava, a synthetic pepper spray. </p>
