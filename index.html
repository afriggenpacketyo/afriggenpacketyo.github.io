          <p>Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida, has become the head of four government bodies, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration, and interim national security advisor. This accumulation of titles raises questions about his ability to effectively manage all these positions, especially with Steve Witkoff handling sensitive diplomacy. The sudden announcement of Rubio's newest position surprised even State Department officials, highlighting the unconventional nature of the Trump administration. Rubio's multiple roles reflect the trust placed in him by President Trump and his close relationship with Susie Wiles, Trump‚Äôs chief of staff.</p>

          <p>China has stated that it is considering U.S. overtures to initiate trade negotiations, which could potentially lead to resolving the ongoing trade war. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times to start discussions on tariffs. However, China insists that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity. The trade war, marked by escalating tariffs, has negatively impacted financial markets and global economic activity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that talks would come up soon, but economists advise caution, noting that both sides are waiting for the other to concede first.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him to be the ambassador to the United Nations. The decision followed criticism after Waltz mistakenly added a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz. Some sources suggest that Waltz was ousted due to the Signal situation and concerns about vetting National Security Council staff. Vice President JD Vance has publicly defended the move as a promotion.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Hutchinson, a Gulf War veteran, was executed in Florida for the 1998 shotgun slayings of his girlfriend and her three young children. Hutchinson had long claimed innocence and attributed the killings to a U.S. government conspiracy. Court records showed Hutchinson argued with his girlfriend before the killings. Hutchinson's defense at trial was based on his claim that two unknown men committed the murders. His lawyers had filed numerous unsuccessful appeals, focused on mental health problems linked to his Army service.</p>

Meanwhile, Block, the parent company of Cash App, reported disappointing earnings and guidance. Venmo and Cash App are competing to attract consumers and add services to monetize their user base.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the majority of iPhones sold in the US will be manufactured in India to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The company has relied on Chinese factories for years but is shifting some production to India. Vietnam will be the country of origin for most iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPod products sold in the US. Apple's sales in China have declined slightly.

          <p>Cambodia is still contending with the deadly threat of landmines, a remnant of decades of conflict. Millions of mines, cluster bombs, and unexploded ordnance still litter the Cambodian countryside. The U.S. bombing raids in the 1960s and 1970s destabilized the country and contributed to the rise of the Khmer Rouge. Cambodia had hoped to be mine-free by the end of 2025, but that plan is now unlikely. Self Help DeMining is one of eight organizations working to clear landmines in Cambodia, with some workers dying during the process.</p>

The tax applies to beverages with 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the statewide ban was signed in 2018. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Assn. Opponents argue the tax is an unfair burden on working families.</p>

          <p>President Trump has shifted his frustration regarding the war in Ukraine from President Zelensky to President Putin. After a difficult meeting with Zelensky, Trump accelerated diplomacy with Putin, drafting a peace plan that offered major concessions to Moscow. However, Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin's demands in the separate talks to settle the war. Trump's zigzagging approach has confounded observers, with sharp differences among his aides about the right approach. He has even threatened to escalate U.S. economic pressure on Russia.</p>

The statement came after a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions. Experts characterize the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Both leaders face tariff-induced headwinds, with Trump struggling to quell fears of a recession and Xi battling low consumption and unemployment.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed how the toy maker is adapting to President Trump's steep tariff hikes on China. Hasbro is diversifying its supply chain and shifting some manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, China, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Cocks expects prices to go up but claims the increases might be lower than peers because of sourcing flexibility. He also noted that trade policy remains fluid, and Hasbro expects movements on the tariff front as the Trump administration negotiates deals with more countries.</p>
