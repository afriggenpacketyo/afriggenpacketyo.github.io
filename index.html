          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democrats left the state to break quorum and block a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The lawsuit argues that Wu and others have abandoned their official duties, a claim disputed by Democrats who call the move a constitutional tactic to protest a "racist gerrymandered map." The governor is asking the Texas Supreme Court for an expedited ruling, escalating the political showdown over the state's congressional boundaries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California with illegally shipping advanced Nvidia AI chips to China. The individuals allegedly exported tens of millions of dollars worth of technology, including the highly sought-after H100 GPUs, by circumventing U.S. export controls implemented in 2022. According to the criminal complaint, the pair used their company to route shipments through Malaysia and Singapore to conceal their final destination. This case highlights the growing challenge Washington faces in preventing its most sensitive semiconductor technology from reaching China.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing, Japan is grappling with the declining number of "hibakusha," or survivors, who can provide firsthand accounts of the tragedy. With the average survivor now over 86 years old, museums and younger generations are taking on the responsibility of passing on their stories. The article highlights the efforts of a 12-year-old boy who guides foreign tourists through Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park, sharing the history of the bombing and his own family's connection to it. These initiatives aim to ensure the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not forgotten as direct witnesses pass away.</p>

          <h2>New Poll Suggests Republican Support Among Pro-Trump Latino Voters May Weaken in Midterms</h2>

          <p>A national poll conducted by Equis indicates that Republican support among Latino voters who backed Donald Trump in 2024 is not guaranteed for the 2026 midterm elections. The survey found that only 27% of these voters would currently vote for a Republican congressional candidate, a significant drop from the 45% who voted for Trump. The research suggests that growing disapproval of Trump's performance and negative views on the economy are contributing factors. However, the poll also shows that this dissatisfaction has not automatically translated into support for Democrats, with many swing voters feeling ignored by both parties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated 22 contracts worth nearly $500 million for the development of mRNA-based vaccines. The canceled projects, which included work by major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna, were aimed at combating respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, the flu, and H5N1 bird flu. Kennedy stated the decision was based on data showing the vaccines "fail to protect effectively" against certain infections, a claim disputed by many health experts.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state law enforcement to locate and arrest Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new Republican-leaning districts. While Abbott has ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to return the absent members, the agency lacks jurisdiction outside the state. This move represents a significant escalation in the political battle over voting maps, with Democrats arguing they are using a constitutionally protected tool to fight an unfair process.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the state's inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 3,000 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the historic property, which was once a luxury resort before being converted into a prison, and the economic impact on the local community.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest annual decline in coral cover in nearly 40 years of records. The severe loss is primarily attributed to widespread coral bleaching caused by unprecedented heat stress from climate change, compounded by cyclones and starfish outbreaks. The survey of 124 reefs indicates a volatile future for the ecosystem, raising concerns that it may reach a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events. This year marked the first time that both the Great Barrier Reef and Australia's second-largest reef, Ningaloo, bleached simultaneously.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has scheduled a September trial for Jasveen Sangha, the woman accused of selling the fatal dose of ketamine to "Friends" actor Matthew Perry. Sangha, who has pleaded not guilty to five counts including distribution resulting in death, is the only one of five defendants in the case who has not reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. Perry died in October 2023 from the acute effects of the drug. Prosecutors allege Perry sought out Sangha after his regular doctor would not provide the amount of ketamine he desired for his depression treatment.</p>

          <p>A UK Charity Commission investigation into Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, found no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny as alleged by whistleblowers. However, the regulator criticized all parties involved for allowing a bitter internal boardroom dispute to damage the charity's reputation publicly. The report imposed no sanctions but issued an action plan to address "governance weaknesses" and a lack of clarity in roles. The dispute led to Prince Harry's resignation earlier this year, and while he welcomed the exoneration from bullying claims, his spokesperson said the report fell short in addressing the consequences of the current leadership's actions.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy, which had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, was found to be in violation of U.S. laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The Trump administration had credited the ban for a historic drop in illegal border crossings in recent months.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back one of their franchise's most productive players, signing veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen to a one-year contract. Allen, who spent 11 seasons with the team before being traded to the Chicago Bears last year in a salary-cap move, returns to bolster the team's receiving corps. The six-time Pro Bowl selection provides a reliable and experienced target for quarterback Justin Herbert. His return is seen as a key addition, especially following the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams, as the team looks to strengthen its offense for the upcoming season.</p>

The decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed fourth on the depth chart and the team recently signed another quarterback. However, injuries to the team's other young quarterbacks, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, have created an opportunity for the fifth-round draft pick. Sanders, who had a high-profile college career playing for his father, Deion Sanders, will now have a crucial chance to prove himself and compete for a spot on the final roster.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has released a damning report on the 2023 Titan submersible implosion, concluding the tragedy that killed five people was preventable. The investigation found that OceanGate, the sub's owner, used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to avoid safety scrutiny for years. The report blames the company's "toxic" safety culture and the negligence of its late CEO, Stockton Rush, for ignoring warnings and continuing to operate the vessel despite known design flaws and previous damage. Investigators concluded that Rush likely would have faced criminal charges had he survived the catastrophic incident.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in cases of flea-borne typhus, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The disease is spread to humans through the feces of infected fleas, which are often carried by rats, opossums, and stray cats. Symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash, and while treatable with antibiotics, severe cases can lead to hospitalization. Officials are urging residents to protect themselves and their pets by using flea control medicine, securing trash, avoiding contact with stray animals, and clearing overgrown vegetation from their properties to deter rodents.</p>

Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. The decision is notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment, especially for drug traffickers. The move may be related to diplomatic considerations, as Mexico has abolished the death penalty and typically requires assurances that its extradited citizens will not be executed, though these cases involved unusual circumstances of transfer to the U.S.</p>

The deal mandates the creation of a $1.2 billion fund for cleanup efforts and requires a direct payment of $875 million to the state for natural resource damages.
