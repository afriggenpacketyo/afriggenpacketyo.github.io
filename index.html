          <p>Japan is hoping to secure special treatment in tariff negotiations with the United States, according to Ryosei Akazawa, Tokyo's top negotiator, as President Trump hints at raising auto import levies. Akazawa expressed optimism that Japan will be treated differently from other countries once a deal is finalized, particularly regarding auto tariffs. He is scheduled to visit Washington for further talks ahead of a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. The focus of negotiations includes securing concessions on auto tariffs and removing additional sector-based tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan.

          <p>Israel's military initiated Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists, leading Iran to launch over 100 drones in retaliation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation aims to eliminate the Iranian threat to Israel's survival and will continue as needed.

          <p>Israel has launched a broad attack on Iran, aiming to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel claims Iran was close to assembling nuclear weapons, prompting the strike. The article suggests that Iran's declining regional influence, due to attacks on its proxies and allies, led it to seek nuclear weapons for deterrence. The attacks carry risks of retaliation, but Israel may have calculated that Iran is currently at its weakest.</p>

          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth reserves to reduce reliance on China, which has imposed restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative for countries like the U.S., but it requires increased public and private investment. The recent shortage of rare earth elements (REEs) has highlighted China's dominance, as it produces approximately 60% of the world's supply and processes nearly 90%. India's potential to develop its domestic supplies could ease the global reliance on China for these crucial minerals.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has delayed an order that would have prevented President Trump from deploying the National Guard in California, setting a hearing for June 17. The lower court had ruled that Trump's deployment was unlawful and exceeded his authority. Governor Gavin Newsom expressed his intention to return the National Guard to their previous roles, including border security and wildfire management. The appeals court's decision allows Trump to maintain control of the National Guard while the legal battle continues.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized as a "preemptive" strike, but potentially constituting a preventive war, which carries moral and practical risks. The action targets Iran's nuclear program and military personnel, aiming to eliminate what Israel perceives as an existential threat. While preemptive attacks are defensible under international law, preventive wars are viewed as illegal and immoral. The extent of the Israeli offensive suggests a goal of regime change, which requires justification based on Iran's history and enmity towards Israel.</p>
