        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones anticipates a significant stock market rally before an eventual 'blow off' top, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1999. He notes that current fiscal and monetary policies, such as a large budget deficit and recent Fed easing, create a more explosive environment than two decades ago. Jones suggests the rally will be driven by speculative frenzy and fear of missing out, requiring investors to be nimble to avoid a subsequent severe correction. He advises a portfolio of gold, cryptocurrencies, and tech stocks to navigate the expected volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Firefly Aerospace increased by 12% following the announcement of its $855 million acquisition of defense technology contractor SciTec. The deal, consisting of cash and stock, is aimed at enhancing Firefly's national security capabilities, particularly in missile warning, tracking, and defense systems. This strategic move follows a recent period of stock volatility for Firefly, which included a rocket explosion during a ground test. The acquisition signals the company's commitment to strengthening its position within the government and defense sectors, complementing existing contracts with partners like NASA.

She expressed daily fears of potential assassination attempts, drawing parallels to the tragic fates of his father and uncle. Hines highlighted the stress caused by his lack of Secret Service protection and believes he may not have disclosed the full extent of the threats he received.

Police reported that the fire was started deliberately with an accelerant, but thankfully, no one was injured in the blaze. The attack has been widely condemned by officials and rights groups, prompting increased police patrols at places of worship across the county.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown has continued for a sixth day, with the Senate scheduled to vote on competing stopgap funding measures from Democrats and Republicans. A White House economic advisor estimated the shutdown is costing the U.S. economy approximately $15 billion per week in lost GDP. Both political parties remain deadlocked, publicly blaming each other for the failure to reach a compromise on appropriations and healthcare provisions. The ongoing stalemate affects numerous government functions and adds to economic uncertainty, though some officials believe it will ultimately be a minor event in economic history.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will permanently remain as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, a role he initially took on a temporary basis. This unconventional arrangement, where a Treasury Secretary simultaneously leads the IRS, was initiated after President Trump removed the previous commissioner. To manage the dual responsibilities, Frank Bisignano, currently the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, will be appointed to the new position of IRS CEO. Bisignano will oversee the agency's daily operations while also continuing to lead the SSA, creating a unique leadership structure within the administration.</p>

Romo specifically highlighted an offensive pass interference penalty he deemed incorrect and an intentional grounding call that was later reversed after a lengthy debate. His pointed commentary drew attention from viewers, particularly as it related to key moments in the game. The scrutiny of the referees was further amplified by a controversial non-call on what appeared to be pass interference on the game's final play.</p>

Key drivers include inflation rates, as gold is often used as a hedge against eroding currency values, and interest rates, which affect the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset. Additionally, geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, and central bank policies all play significant roles in its day-to-day valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

Kimmel's favorability registered at +3, while Trump's was -13, creating a 16-point gap.

These cells act as crucial guards that prevent the immune system from overreacting and attacking the body's own tissues, which is the cause of autoimmune diseases.

While Takaichi has previously criticized interest rate hikes, her election may not prevent a near-term increase by the Bank of Japan, though it could limit future monetary tightening. The overall assessment suggests a trade-off between potential economic expansion and the risk of exacerbating Japan's already substantial national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Davis shares her own reading journey, moving between diverse authors and finding unexpected joy in books received as gifts. She argues for a reciprocal relationship where writing teaches one how to read, and reading inspires one to write, fostering a continuous, intimate conversation with literature.</p>

          <p>The first of three supermoons in 2025 will be visible on Monday night, appearing slightly larger and brighter than a typical full moon. This astronomical event occurs when the full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the perigee. According to NASA, this proximity can make the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than when it is at its farthest point. While the phenomenon is observable worldwide without special equipment, the difference in size can be subtle to the casual observer.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 35% after the company announced a major partnership with OpenAI. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI chips over several years, with OpenAI receiving a warrant to acquire up to 160 million AMD shares. If fully exercised, this would give the AI leader an approximate 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker. This strategic alliance positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI's ambitious infrastructure projects, reducing its reliance on a single vendor and validating AMD's next-generation chip technology.

          <p>A thought experiment explored by ChatGPT suggests that if U.S. billionaires paid taxes at the same effective rate as an average New Yorker, it could generate tens or hundreds of billions in additional government revenue. The analysis highlights the disparity where billionaires often have a lower effective tax rate (8-15%) compared to average workers (25-30%) because their income is primarily from capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. This extra revenue could fund public services like education and healthcare or reduce deficits. While some argue it could disincentivize investment, studies suggest moderate increases have limited impact on economic growth.</p>

The artifact, which depicts the three ancient Egyptian seasons, appears to have been precisely cut from the tomb wall with an electric saw. The tomb, belonging to a high-ranking official named Khenti Ka, had been sealed and used for storage since 2019.

In addition to financial barriers, international fans from many countries face lengthy visa application processes without a fast-track system, potentially preventing them from attending.

          <p>Turkey has become the unofficial capital of the hair transplant industry, attracting approximately one million medical tourists in 2022 for this procedure alone. The boom is driven by significantly lower costs compared to countries like the U.S., with all-inclusive packages often including flights, hotels, and the surgery for a fraction of the price. While the industry generates billions in revenue for Turkey, its rapid growth has raised concerns about oversight and the risks posed by unlicensed "black market clinics."

While cultural and geographical differences exist, the model suggests a way to address the U.S. childcare crisis, where costs are prohibitive and availability is scarce. Compensating grandparents could strengthen intergenerational bonds, provide financial clarity, and create a more communal family unit focused on raising children.</p>
