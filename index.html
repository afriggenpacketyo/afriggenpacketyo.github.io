          <p>Keir Starmer reported that talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv mark a "significant moment" in the push to secure a ceasefire in its conflict with Russia. Around 30 global leaders, including the UK prime minister, French President, German Chancellor, and Polish Prime Minister, participated in the meeting hosted by Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky. The leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Monday, threatening "massive" sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if it does not comply. The Kremlin reacted by accusing European leaders of making "contradictory" and "generally confrontational" remarks about Russia.</p>

          <p>India accused Pakistan of violating a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States, reporting multiple explosions in India-administered Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan breached the agreement, while Pakistani officials denied the violation, claiming India had committed violations in some areas. U.S. President Trump initially announced the ceasefire, attributing it to U.S. mediation, but India disputed this claim. The ceasefire followed weeks of clashes triggered by a gun massacre on tourists last month, with both nations carrying out strikes using drones and missiles before the agreement was reached.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is facing criticism and threatening to derail crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns about Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures creating a conflict of interest. Democrats, including Sen. Jeff Merkley, have voiced concerns that individuals can enrich the president by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls. The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and First Lady Melania Trump's coin have added billions of dollars to his coffers, leading to accusations of a "pay-for-play scheme.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces potential criticism for being perceived as slow to act, regardless of his decisions on interest rates. Some economists believe Powell's cautious approach, given the volatile policy mix with Trump's tariffs, leaves him in a no-win situation. President Trump has been urging the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and labor market, dismissing the idea of pre-emptive cuts. Economists note that the Fed's reliance on labor market data could lead to delayed action, potentially missing the mark on addressing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The US and China have commenced trade talks in Switzerland, signaling a potential easing of the trade war initiated by President Trump. Top trade officials from both sides met in the first high-level meeting since the US imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in January, leading to retaliatory measures from Beijing. Despite previous rhetoric, both countries face economic pressure from the levies, with factory output in China and the US economy experiencing negative impacts. The talks aim to de-escalate tensions and reassure markets, though expectations for a breakthrough remain low.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The order did not specify how the increase in staffing would be funded. Trump has long called for local and state law enforcement, as well as the National Guard, to assist with border enforcement. The order calls on the DHS to supplement it's current efforts by deputizing and contracting with State and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, officers and personnel within other federal agencies.</p>

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus.
