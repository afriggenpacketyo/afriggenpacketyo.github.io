          <p>A joint US-China study using data from NASA's InSight lander has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core, contrary to previous expectations.  Analysis of seismic waves from marsquakes indicated a core approximately 600km in radius. This finding has implications for our understanding of planetary formation and the possibility of past plate tectonics on Mars. The discovery adds Mars to the list of celestial bodies with solid inner cores, alongside Earth and the Moon.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse, resulting in a 'Blood Moon,' was visible across parts of Asia, Europe, and Africa.  The phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, casting Earth's shadow on the moon.  The moon appears red due to the scattering of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere.  The eclipse was widely observed and appreciated by stargazers.</p>
