          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to contribute $1,000 to so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching potential government contributions under a proposed savings program for newborns. CEO Michael Dell announced this commitment at a White House roundtable with President Donald Trump, while Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon expressed support for the plan, which is part of a Republican-backed budget bill. The program, previously known as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The bill faces pushback in the Senate from fiscally conservative Republicans. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>A new House GOP bill, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, seeks to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities like Los Angeles that refuse to comply with federal immigration authorities. Introduced by Rep. Nick Langworthy and Sen. Ted Cruz, the bill would empower state and local officers to collaborate with ICE, even if local laws mandate otherwise. This legislation comes after violent clashes between rioters and federal authorities in Los Angeles over ICE raids. The bill aims to address concerns that sanctuary policies impede federal immigration enforcement and jeopardize public safety. </p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates a widening divergence between men and women regarding support for abortion rights, three years after the fall of Roe v Wade. Sixty-one percent of women now identify as "pro-choice," compared to only 41% of men. This gap is attributed more to changes in women's attitudes, who have become more supportive of abortion since Roe's collapse, than to shifts in men's views. The poll also reveals a record disagreement on the morality of abortion, with 57% of women and 40% of men viewing it as moral. </p>
