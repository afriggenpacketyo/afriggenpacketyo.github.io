        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical experts are pushing back against recent White House statements suggesting a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Doctors emphasize that untreated high fevers pose significant risks to fetal development, including potential neurological issues, and that acetaminophen remains the safest available option for pain and fever relief for expectant mothers. They express concern that the "tough it out" rhetoric could lead pregnant women to avoid necessary medication or turn to more dangerous alternatives like ibuprofen, which are known to cause harm. The medical community, citing large-scale studies, continues to recommend acetaminophen when medically necessary.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new defender, 18-year-old Giovanni Leoni, is expected to be sidelined for several months after suffering a suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury during his debut match. The injury occurred during the team's Carabao Cup victory over Southampton, forcing him off the pitch in the 81st minute. This development leaves Liverpool with only three senior centre-backs, posing a significant challenge for manager Arne Slot early in the season. Leoni, who recently joined from Parma, expressed his gratitude for the support he has received and his determination to return to playing as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become more affordable for homeowners looking to borrow. A comparison of a $100,000 loan shows that a HELOC currently offers slightly lower monthly payments due to its variable rate, which can further benefit from future rate cuts. However, a home equity loan provides the stability of a fixed interest rate, protecting borrowers from potential market volatility. The choice between the two depends on an individual's risk tolerance and financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare's CEO, have formally complained to a judge about his portrayal as a "left-wing assassin" and Antifa affiliate by government officials. The defense argues these extrajudicial statements violate his right to a fair trial by prejudicing the public and potential jury pool, especially in light of other recent high-profile shootings. They claim the government knows these affiliations are false, citing the absence of any mention of Antifa in Mangione's extensive journal writings. The judge has ordered the Department of Justice to respond to these allegations of violating court rules.</p>

          <p>YouTube has announced it will begin reinstating creators whose channels were previously terminated for violating since-rescinded policies on COVID-19 and election misinformation. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, parent company Alphabet stated the move reflects a commitment to free expression and political debate, acknowledging that many accounts were banned under rules no longer in effect. This decision is part of a broader trend among tech companies to roll back content moderation policies amid pressure from conservatives who argue their voices were unfairly suppressed. The company emphasized its value for conservative voices on the platform and their role in civic discourse.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is escalating its war strategy by focusing on crippling Russia's economy through long-range drone and missile attacks on oil refineries, pipelines, and other key infrastructure. By developing a robust domestic weapons industry, Ukraine now produces millions of drones annually, reducing its reliance on foreign aid and applying its own form of economic sanctions. This campaign has already reportedly diminished Russia's oil exports to their lowest point since the war began, causing domestic fuel shortages. This strategic shift, which aims to reduce the funds available for Russia's war machine, has gained quiet backing from European allies investing in drone production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is generating mixed reactions from economists regarding its potential impact on American jobs. Some experts suggest the high cost could incentivize companies to hire more domestic workers, particularly in the tech sector where H-1B labor is common. However, other research indicates that restricting access to skilled foreign workers could stifle innovation and long-term economic growth, ultimately hurting job creation for Americans in related fields. The policy aims to prevent companies from using the program to hire cheaper foreign labor, but critics worry it may choke off a vital source of specialized talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee for mayor of New York City, has alleged that he received multiple offers of money to drop out of the race. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, condemned the offers as "unethical and illegal" and has vowed to remain in the campaign until Election Day. He warned that he would start naming the wealthy individuals behind the offers if they persist. The claim comes amid a complex four-way race, with President Trump having previously suggested that both Sliwa and current Mayor Eric Adams should withdraw to create a direct contest between Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>A family of three has become the first to arrive in the United Kingdom under the new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. The scheme involves the UK accepting one refugee with a valid protection case from France for every migrant returned to France who had crossed the Channel illegally. So far, four migrants have been removed from the UK under this pilot program. The government hopes the treaty will deter illegal crossings by disrupting the business model of human smuggling gangs. However, the plan has faced criticism from opposition parties and rights groups for its limited scope.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is aiming to boost sales of its F-150 pickup truck by offering special financing rates to customers with subprime credit scores, typically below 620. This promotion makes the popular truck more accessible to a wider range of buyers and helps reduce dealer inventory levels. While such programs can increase sales, they also carry risks, as borrowers with lower credit scores are more likely to default on loans. Ford Credit stated that it only finances customers it believes are creditworthy and that its proprietary scoring model assesses risk beyond just a FICO score. (not investment advice)</p>

This analysis explores how Kirk was seen within the MAGA movement not just as a media personality but as a central organizer and networker who empowered young conservatives to be politically active. His death is viewed by his allies as an attack on their right to participate in the public sphere, fueling an emotional and sometimes authoritarian response.
