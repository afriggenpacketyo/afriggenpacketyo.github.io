          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are jointly pushing for a full release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Massie stated a desire to see more than just reported letters, emphasizing the need for financial records to "follow the money." Their bipartisan legislation aims to force a House vote on the matter, bypassing Speaker Mike Johnson, whom they criticize for adjourning the House early. The proposed law includes protections to redact victims' names and prevent the release of sensitive material.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met in Scotland to negotiate a trade deal ahead of an August 1 deadline. Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU goods if an agreement is not reached, adding to existing levies. The EU is seeking a baseline tariff of around 15%, similar to the deal secured by Japan, to avoid the steep increase. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the deadline is firm, increasing pressure on both sides to find a resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Challenging recent narratives of superhero fatigue, Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful domestic opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million. The film's strong performance, coupled with a global haul of $218 million, is seen as a positive sign for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has had a mixed box office record since "Avengers: Endgame." Analysts suggest this success, alongside positive critical reception, indicates that a focus on quality over quantity is helping to reinvigorate the franchise and attract audiences back to theaters.</p>

The announcement comes as resident doctors engage in a five-day strike over pay, with the British Medical Association (BMA) arguing that wages have significantly declined in real terms.

It highlights the dangers and inefficiencies of airdrops and criticizes the U.S.-Israeli backed GHF distribution system, which the UN and other agencies view as inhumane and militarized.

          <p>A one-year-old boy in Bihar, India, reportedly killed a cobra by biting it after the snake had coiled around his hands while he was playing. The infant, named Govinda, fainted after the incident and was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Doctors reported that the venom's effects were mild and not fatal, and the child is now in stable condition and under observation. The incident is particularly remarkable given that the Indian cobra is one of the "big four" venomous snakes responsible for the majority of snakebite deaths in the country.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, White House OMB Director Russell Vought criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for being "too late" on interest rate decisions and defended the administration's review of federal funds. Vought addressed the temporary withholding of education and NIH funding, stating it was to prevent misuse on programs the administration opposes and to root out waste. He asserted the president's authority to spend less than Congress appropriates, hinting at a potential challenge to the Impoundment Control Act and a desire to shift the "business of spending" in Washington.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by "CBS Sunday Morning" and The Marshall Project has exposed how routine, and often faulty, drug tests in hospitals are leading to traumatic consequences for new mothers. The report highlights cases where women tested positive for opiates after consuming common foods like poppy seed bagels, triggering immediate child welfare investigations that can separate them from their newborns. Despite well-documented evidence of false positives from various foods and medications, many hospitals are required to report positive results before a more accurate confirmatory test is completed, leading to what one advocate calls using a "drug test as a parenting test."</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza, including Gaza City and Deir al-Balah, to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. This move, which includes establishing secure land routes for aid convoys, comes amid mounting international pressure and warnings of famine in the region. While the UN's food agency welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. Hamas officials dismissed the pause as a deceptive tactic to improve Israel's international image.</p>

          <p>A financial columnist analyzes the newly established "Trump IRA," a savings vehicle for children under 18, viewing it as more of a political giveaway than a robust financial tool. While acknowledging the free $1,000 government contribution for newborns is worth taking, the article argues there are better long-term strategies for parents. The author suggests alternatives like 529 education savings plans, custodial Roth IRAs, and whole life insurance policies offer more significant and flexible benefits for a child's future. These options provide greater tax advantages, higher contribution limits, and more versatile uses for the funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness is not just due to having an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that workers feel more effective and productive on the clock. By condensing their work into fewer hours, teams are forced to streamline processes and eliminate busywork, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This feeling of being on top of their work and life contributes significantly to their overall well-being, improved work-life balance, and even business profitability.</p>
