          <p>Jordan Murray, a 25-year-old California man, is accused of fatally stabbing a 40-year-old man after being released from jail on mental health diversion six months prior. Murray had allegedly committed two violent robberies in May and June of 2024, during which he sprayed employees with a caustic chemical. Despite these charges, he was released in November 2024 under a mental health diversion program. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office expressed dismay that this "preventable murder" occurred so soon after his release, highlighting concerns about the effectiveness of the diversion program. Murray is now held without bail and faces charges of murder and felony robbery.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo reveals that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases before this year's Spring Statement. The memo proposed raising £3bn to £4bn annually through measures like increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. Some Labour MPs have expressed concerns about welfare cuts and are advocating for alternative funding methods, such as a wealth tax. The memo underscores internal discussions on fiscal rules and taxation approaches.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that disruptions to its online services, stemming from a cyber-attack last month, are expected to persist until July. Customers have been unable to place online orders for nearly a month, and the retailer estimates the attack will reduce current-year profits by approximately £300m. The ransomware attack, believed to be the work of Scattered Spider using tools from DragonForce, initially impacted click-and-collect and contactless payments.

          <p>Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, stated that U.S. export controls on advanced A.I. chips to China have spurred Chinese companies to accelerate their own development efforts. Speaking in Taipei, Huang noted that these regulations, intended to limit China's access to cutting-edge technology, have instead strengthened domestic companies like Huawei. He explained that Nvidia's market share in China has significantly decreased as Chinese firms have filled the void, receiving substantial government support. While Huawei's chips may not match Nvidia's capabilities entirely, they are sufficient for Chinese companies to provide A.I. services, leading Nvidia to advocate for continued sales in China to maintain competitiveness.</p>

The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities.

Lucas, a yoga instructor, was critically injured in the attack that resulted in the deaths of three children. She says cooking has become a "trigger" for hyper-vigilance since the attack and believes blunt-tipped knives present a much lower risk of serious injury. Lucas has launched the Let's Be Blunt campaign to promote this cultural shift, drawing parallels to other public behavior changes like the ban on indoor smoking.

          <p>British businesses in China are reporting increasing difficulties for the fifth consecutive year, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and a perceived depreciation of foreign firms in China's industrial policy. Despite these challenges, British firms "continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with, and commitment to, the Chinese market," according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China. Escalating tensions between China and the US are causing many firms to delay investments globally, particularly those with China exposure. The chamber is calling for a more favorable policy environment with clear, fairly enforced, and consistently applied rules.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned following controversy over his statement that he had never bought rice, drawing criticism amid a national rice shortage and soaring prices. The comment made him appear out of touch with the struggles of Japanese consumers. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation, appointing Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address the crisis. The shortage is attributed to long-standing policies protecting small farmers, leading to uncultivated land. Urban voters have expressed frustration over the high prices and shortages, further lowering Ishiba's approval ratings ahead of parliamentary elections.</p>

          <p>A House panel convened overnight to discuss President Trump's budget bill, facing significant hurdles as Republican factions clash over its details. Trump pressured Republicans to support the bill, warning against "grandstanders." Speaker Mike Johnson faces a narrow margin for passage, with all Democrats expected to oppose the bill. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates resist significant cuts to the program. A provision on state and local tax deductions (SALT) is also contentious. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall “mega tsunami” could potentially devastate parts of America's West Coast if a strong earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially impacting cities like Seattle and Portland. The quake could also cause coastal land to sink by as much as 6.5 feet, increasing the risk. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this potential earthquake would occur within minutes, leaving little time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

The other perspective suggests that Manchester United's struggles are largely self-inflicted, citing inconsistent performances, poor spending decisions, and a mid-season managerial change.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has characterized US export controls on AI chips to China as a "failure," noting that Chinese companies are increasingly turning to locally-developed technology. Huang stated that the curbs have forced companies to seek alternatives, boosting the domestic supply chain and driving Chinese firms like Huawei to develop their own semiconductors. Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market has fallen significantly since the implementation of the controls. While the Trump administration rolled back some curbs, Huang praised Trump's approach, arguing that US companies are not the only providers of AI technology.</p>

The executive branch cannot suspend habeas corpus; only Congress can do so in cases of rebellion or invasion.
