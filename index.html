          <h2>Archaeologists Discover Remains of Elite Woman in Ancient Peru</h2>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have unearthed the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman from the Caral civilization, one of the oldest in South America, which existed around the same time as civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. The woman's remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric and included a mantle of macaw feathers, skin, nails, and hair. This discovery suggests that women held important positions in the ancient Caral society, challenging previous assumptions that rulers were predominantly men. The team presented the woman's funeral trousseau, which included a toucan beak, a stone bowl, and a straw basket, at Peru's culture ministry.</p>

          <p>Shanghai has launched an ambitious plan to spearhead the development of China's commercial space sector, aiming to boost its annual output to $13.7 billion by 2027. The plan includes subsidies of up to 300 million yuan for companies developing commercial rockets, satellites, and terminals. Shanghai seeks to leverage its position as the home base of Commercial Aircraft Corp of China and capitalize on the synergy between commercial space programs and civil aviation to compete with American space giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin. The city plans to be able to build 100 rockets, 1,000 satellites and a million application terminals a year.</p>

          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen have reportedly shot down seven U.S. Reaper drones, costing over $200 million, in recent weeks, marking a significant loss for the Pentagon.

U.S. senators are raising concerns about civilian casualties resulting from the strikes, specifically questioning a recent attack at the Ras Isa fuel terminal. The Houthis have also been persistently firing missiles and one-way attack drones at U.S. military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>

          <p>Immigration lawyers are challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership to a terrorism prison in El Salvador. While securing provisional orders to halt deportations in several states, lawyers are struggling to protect approximately 140 Venezuelans already deported. The ACLU has filed a lawsuit arguing the act's invocation violates due process, citing the insufficient time given to migrants to contest their removal. Judges have criticized the administration's use of the act, with one judge stating "Cows have better treatment now under the law."</p>

          <p>China has reportedly waived its retaliatory tariffs on certain semiconductor imports from the US, signaling a potential thaw in the trade war between the two countries. At least eight integrated circuit-related tariff codes were exempted from levies imposed earlier this month in response to US tariffs on Chinese products, although tariffs on memory chips remain.

          <p>A Japanese government survey reveals that 35% of local government officials have experienced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, significantly higher than the rate found in the private sector. This suggests that public officials, considered "servants of the whole community," regularly face unreasonable requests from taxpayers. The government has submitted an amendment bill to parliament requiring companies and municipalities to establish rules against abuse and systems for victims to file complaints, reflecting a growing awareness of "kasu-hara," or harassment by customers.</p>

His comments come after a deadly Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv.

The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu meant the Post Office did not own the code and has been unable to build a replacement, even after the system contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice, with hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted for theft and false accounting. Warnings about potential problems with the deal's terms were issued to senior government figures before it was signed. The Post Office has finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023.</p>

This move is considered a critical blow to Iran's terror network in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in the Tri-Border Area. Paraguay also expanded its designations of the armed wings of Hezbollah and Hamas to include the entirety of both organizations. The U.S. is calling on all countries to hold the Iranian regime accountable and prevent its operatives from operating in their territories.</p>
