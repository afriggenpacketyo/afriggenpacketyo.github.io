          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, India launched strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan. The Indian government stated that the strikes were measured and non-escalatory, targeting locations where attacks against India were planned. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of aggression and asserted its right to respond, raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. Global leaders have urged restraint from both sides to prevent further escalation of the conflict, which has deep roots in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>China, a leading producer and consumer of aluminum, relies heavily on imported high-quality bauxite. However, a new French technology developed by IB2 is being implemented in Shanxi province to enable the production of aluminum from Chinaâ€™s low-grade ore. This technology neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing the Bayer process to efficiently refine high-silica bauxite. This innovation could significantly reduce Chinaâ€™s dependence on foreign sources of aluminum ore and contribute to a greener aluminum industry, aligning with Beijing's environmental goals.</p>

Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration while firmly opposing any notion of Canada becoming the 51st state. Despite trade tensions and border disputes, both leaders affirmed their commitment to maintaining friendly relations, though disagreements on tariffs persist.</p>

          <p>Burger King is facing a class action lawsuit alleging that its Whopper advertisements exaggerate the size of the burger, making it appear 35% larger with twice the amount of meat. A U.S. District Judge ruled that it is "plausible" that reasonable consumers could be misled by the promotional images. The lawsuit claims the burgers are depicted as "overflowing" their buns. Burger King maintains that its marketing team "styled sandwiches more beautifully" and that consumers know the photos are to make items appear appetizing. Subway faces a similar lawsuit over misleading ads.</p>
