          <p>Recently released police documents concerning the Bryan Kohberger case reveal several unsettling events at the victims' home before the November 2022 murders. One victim had reported seeing an unknown man staring at her and mentioned having a stalker, while on another occasion, the residents found their front door mysteriously ajar. These details, part of hundreds of documents released after Kohberger's sentencing, illustrate the extensive investigation that led to his conviction. The motive for the quadruple homicide, however, remains unknown to the public.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is not a hoax, emphasizing the need for full transparency and for all involved parties to be brought to justice. His comments come amid pressure, including from within the Republican party, for the Trump administration to release more information about the deceased sex offender. Johnson expressed that he shares the public's concerns and questions regarding the case's handling by the Justice Department. This situation has created political friction, with some Republicans joining Democrats in seeking access to the files.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to investigate the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This research aims to better understand and predict "space weather," which can disrupt critical systems like GPS, communication networks, and power grids. The satellites will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission also deployed several other small satellites for various scientific and technological experiments, including testing 5G communications in space.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups and lawyers are urging Germany to clarify its asylum policy for Palestinians, particularly those fleeing Gaza, after the government temporarily halted processing their applications. The Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF) cited an "uncertain situation" but has since resumed processing after numerous court rulings found the inaction unlawful. Advocates argue that Palestinians should be granted full refugee status under the Geneva Convention, especially as the UN agency UNRWA faces operational bans, rather than the lesser "subsidiary protection." This distinction significantly impacts long-term residency prospects and family reunification rights for those seeking safety.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that did not meet Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to fall. Despite the profit drop, the company indicated that travel demand has stabilized, a sentiment echoed by other major airlines recently.

The airline anticipates its third-quarter unit revenue will range from a 2% decrease to a 2% increase compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

A national fitness monitoring program called SLOfit, in use since 1987, helps identify and nurture talent.

          <p>After four decades, an arrest has been made in the 1984 murder of 18-year-old Terrance Arndt and the sexual assault of his female companion in Northern California. Police arrested 64-year-old Roger Neil Schmidt Sr. in Arizona after using forensic genetic genealogy to link his DNA to evidence from the crime scene. At the time of the attack, the two teenagers were parked in a car when the suspect shot Arndt and assaulted the female victim. The breakthrough in the cold case provides a long-awaited resolution for the victims' families and the community, which was deeply affected by the crime.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission is undertaking a massive revision of the electoral rolls in the state of Bihar, requiring the re-verification of nearly 80 million voters ahead of state elections. The stated goal is to remove deceased individuals, duplicate entries, and "illegal immigrants," but the move has triggered significant controversy. Opposition parties and critics argue the process, which requires citizens to provide specific documents to prove eligibility, risks disenfranchising millions, particularly poor, Muslim, and Dalit communities who may lack the necessary paperwork. The issue has been challenged in India's Supreme Court amid fears of engineered voter exclusion.</p>

          <p>Juliet Schor, a lead researcher on global four-day workweek trials, reports that the experiments have yielded surprising benefits beyond expectations. In studies involving hundreds of companies, employees not only experienced less burnout and better health but also reported a significant jump in their own productivity and well-being. This challenges the assumption that people would simply work faster; instead, the entire company's work process is reorganized more efficiently. Schor notes that despite these positive outcomes, widespread adoption is slow due to managerial reluctance to cede control and the perceived risk of such a radical change.</p>

She highlighted concerns over China's industrial overcapacity, market access barriers, and export controls on critical materials, warning that the EU's openness depends on progress. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in turn, described the relationship as mutually beneficial and called for deeper cooperation amid global instability. The talks underscore ongoing tensions between the two powers over economic policies and China's stance on the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is holding a large-scale recall vote that could oust dozens of lawmakers from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. Pro-recall campaigners, initiated by civic groups, accuse the legislators of being "pro-China" and undermining Taiwan's democracy by blocking key government priorities, including defense spending. The KMT, which holds a legislative majority with a smaller party, denies being pro-Beijing and frames the recall as a political manipulation by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The outcome could shift the balance of power in the legislature and has deepened political divisions amid rising military pressure from China.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as backyard cottages or garage apartments. The legislation would authorize government-backed second mortgages specifically for ADU projects, a financing option that is currently rare. By allowing lenders to consider projected rental income and post-construction home value, the bill aims to help lower- and middle-income households build ADUs. Proponents argue this could help alleviate the national housing shortage by boosting supply, though local zoning restrictions remain a major barrier.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that China is not doing all it can to stop the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals because it views cooperation with the U.S. as a form of political leverage. Despite having the ability to crack down, as demonstrated in 2019, Beijing's efforts have been inconsistent and tied to the broader state of U.S.-China relations. After a period of non-cooperation, China recently resumed talks and imposed some new restrictions, but it has not implemented key measures like verifying chemical buyers' identities. Experts believe China is withholding more significant action until it can extract concessions from Washington on other issues.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable target than the popular 10,000-step goal, is associated with significant health benefits. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, found that this level of activity was linked to a reduced risk of dementia, heart disease, cancer, and depression. The widely-known 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and is not based on scientific evidence. Researchers hope these findings will encourage more people to use step-tracking as a practical way to improve their long-term health.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on the "Full Send Podcast" hosted by the Nelk Boys, a group popular with young, right-leaning men, in an apparent effort to reach a younger audience. During the interview, Netanyahu discussed the war in Gaza, praised Donald Trump, and answered lighthearted questions, including his preference for Burger King over McDonald's. The appearance has been widely condemned as an attempt to normalize a leader for whom the ICC has issued an arrest warrant for alleged war crimes. Critics point to the absurdity of discussing fast food while a man-made famine grips Gaza, for which many hold Netanyahu responsible.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Guardian explores the concept of "citizenship insecurity," a feeling of estrangement from the United States experienced by citizens who no longer identify with the country's values or trust its direction. This sentiment, intensified since the 2024 election, is driving some Americans, even those with relative privilege, to seek second passports as a form of insurance. The author argues this insecurity stems not from immediate physical danger but from a profound sense of political and social unraveling. The feeling is compounded for marginalized groups who face more direct threats under current administration policies that challenge established norms and rights.</p>

          <p>The bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) is experiencing internal turmoil, with at least two Democratic governors, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, planning to stop paying membership dues. Their frustration stems from what they perceive as the organization's weak response to federal overreach by the Trump administration on issues like funding disbursements and National Guard deployments. The governors feel the NGA is failing to serve its purpose as a collective voice for states' rights, raising questions about the group's effectiveness in a highly polarized political climate.
