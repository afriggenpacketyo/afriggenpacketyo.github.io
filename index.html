          <p>Cassie Ventura's cross-examination in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial involved scrutiny of explicit text messages and alleged drug use. The defense suggested Ventura proposed a 'freak off' with Combs and that their drug use on the day of the alleged sexual assault may have contributed to Combs' violent behavior. Ventura testified that she did not know if the drugs they took were a bad batch of MDMA. Court adjourned, and Ventura is set to return to the stand, where the trial will continue to unfold.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers are likely to see price increases later this month due to tariffs, despite the retailer's better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Rainey stated that even with reduced duties on Chinese imports, tariffs remain too high for retailers to absorb. Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, driven by online advertising and its third-party marketplace. The company expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.</p>

          <p>An Army anniversary parade in Washington, D.C., coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade, part of the Army's 250th-anniversary celebrations, will include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. Trump defended the cost, stating it would be 'peanuts' compared to its value, while critics, including some Democrats, have labeled the plan wasteful and self-aggrandizing. Trump has expressed interest in military parades since his first term.</p>

The Gulf War in 1991 prompted China to modernize its military, leading to the development of sophisticated weapons.

          <p>With unemployment rates low, the Trump administration is relying on officials to fill multiple roles, leading to concerns about dysfunction and conflicts of interest. Todd Blanche is both the deputy attorney general and acting Librarian of Congress, while Marco Rubio serves as secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security advisor. This 'dual-hatting' reflects Trump's attempts to learn from his first term and Project 2025, which recommended identifying and training loyal operatives. The reliance on acting officials and the appointment of individuals with questionable qualifications raise concerns about competence and conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to ease tariffs on Chinese goods has provided some relief for businesses, but long-term planning remains uncertain. While the reduction from 145% to 30% offers a temporary reprieve, many businesses, particularly small ones, still face significant burdens. Walmart has already announced that it will have to raise prices on some items in response to tariff-fueled cost increases. Business owners are concerned about the temporary nature of the easing and are hesitant to make long-term decisions without a stable trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and diversify its consumer base. While Dick's has been financially strong, it lacks international presence, which Foot Locker provides with its 2,400 stores across 20 countries. Analysts note that Foot Locker's urban consumer base complements Dick's suburban athlete customer base. However, investors reacted negatively to the news, given Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on President Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the power of lower court judges to block presidential orders nationwide. Justices questioned whether lower courts overstepped their authority and considered the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself, with critics arguing it violates the 14th Amendment. The US solicitor general argued for curtailing lower courts' power, while the New Jersey solicitor general warned of the 'chaos' that would result from a patchwork system of citizenship.

          <p>Singer Chris Brown was arrested in England for allegedly attacking a man with a bottle at a London nightclub in 2023. The Metropolitan Police took the 36-year-old into custody on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, following a report from producer Abe Diaw, who claimed Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack. Brown, who has a history of legal issues, including a 2009 assault conviction, is facing a $16 million lawsuit from Diaw. The arrest occurred as Brown was preparing for an international tour.</p>

          <p>The full retirement age to collect Social Security benefits has increased to 67 for Americans born in 1960, meaning they will have to work longer to receive full benefits.

The increase to age 67 is the last scheduled increase under the 1983 amendments, though future legislation could further raise the retirement age.</p>
