          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, just before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote, citing a review of his prior associations. Trump stated he will soon announce a new nominee who will align with his mission and prioritize America in space. Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, expressed gratitude for the experience and appreciation for government complexities. Musk responded by praising Isaacman's competence and character, while Isaacman himself reaffirmed his commitment to advancing space exploration and inspiring future generations.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough choices are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes spending plans for key sectors. Increased funding in 2024 for transport, net zero, hospitals, schools, and prisons will not continue year-on-year. The level of NHS spending will significantly impact potential cuts to unprotected areas, including the criminal justice system. The government aims to scrutinize every pound spent, while the Chancellor rules out more borrowing or tax increases, leading to speculation about spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Theoharis and Sandweiss-Back argue that to effectively counter Trump's proposed legislative cuts, a new social contract is needed that lifts from the bottom of society. They draw lessons from past poor people's movements, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), which staged mass marches and demonstrations. The NWRO championed welfare as a right and demanded a guaranteed adequate income, principles that remain relevant today. The authors advocate for the poor to unite across differences, assume leadership, and build visionary projects of survival to transform indignation into lasting power.</p>

Many recipients rely on these checks for their primary income, causing potential panic.

          <p>A TikTok video highlighting the importance of wearing sunscreen on flights has sparked debate, with dermatologists confirming that airplane windows block most UVB rays but not all UVA rays. While the risk for occasional flyers is low, flight crew members face a higher risk of melanoma due to increased exposure. Sunscreen is recommended for all passengers, especially those with a history of skin cancer or increased sun sensitivity. Dermatologists emphasize the importance of broad-spectrum sunscreen and physical protection like hats and sunglasses to mitigate sun damage during flights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including freezing federal contracts and grants, revoking the ability to enroll international students, and threatening its tax-exempt status, have sparked a debate over academic freedom. Harvard has publicly rejected the demands, stating they amount to ceding control of the university to the government. Critics argue that Trump's motives are to intimidate and break down institutions of higher learning. Harvard's substantial endowment allows it to withstand pressure and engage in legal battles, challenging the administration's actions in court.</p>

          <p>Doctors' associations and medical schools warn that a Republican proposal to limit federal student loans for professional programs could worsen a national shortage of doctors. The proposal would limit federal student loans for medical school to $150,000 and eliminate a federal graduate loan program. Advocates argue that these changes could drive low-income students away from medicine, make loans harder to repay, and push students into expensive private loans. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the U.S. will face a shortage of between 37,800 and 124,000 physicians by 2034.</p>
