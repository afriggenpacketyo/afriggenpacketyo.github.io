          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head during a rally in BogotÃ¡ and is in critical condition. The 39-year-old senator, a right-wing critic of President Gustavo Petro, had announced his candidacy for next year's election. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and an investigation is underway. The Colombian government and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the attack, with Rubio blaming it on violent leftist rhetoric. The article emphasizes the political tensions surrounding the incident and the ongoing investigation. Optimism for the senator's recovery is tempered by the severity of his injuries and the charged political climate. </p>

Both experts agree that choosing the right chiropractor and using a comprehensive approach to care are crucial.

          <p>A report by NPR and PBS Frontline investigates why communities struggle to rebuild effectively after disasters, focusing on the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and comparing it to recovery efforts in Houston, New York, and New Jersey. The investigation reveals that communities often fail to rebuild in a way that would protect them from future disasters, due to inertia, conflicting priorities, and the influence of private developers. The report highlights debates about whether the government should enforce stricter building codes in vulnerable areas and the challenges of balancing individual property rights with community resilience. Ultimately, the article finds a lack of a comprehensive plan for disaster recovery, leaving communities vulnerable to future storms.</p>

          <p>A new Social Security garnishment is set to begin this summer for retirees who have defaulted on their federal student loans. The Trump administration will begin garnishing up to 15% of Social Security benefits for delinquent federal student loan borrowers, with the caveat that recipients must be left with at least a $750 monthly Social Security benefit. However, there are two legal ways to avoid this garnishment: qualifying for the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program or applying for a financial hardship with the Department of Education (DOE). According to the CFPB, 82% of Social Security beneficiaries currently in default on their federal student loans would qualify for the hardship exemption. (not investment advice)</p>
