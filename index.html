        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major technology stocks saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts starting in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for operations and expansion, thus reducing their financial costs. The article notes this shift comes after weaker jobs data and a cooler inflation report, increasing pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts are upgrading their ratings for Palo Alto Networks, suggesting the recent stock sell-off following its bid to acquire CyberArk was an overreaction. Firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler have raised their price targets, viewing the $25 billion deal as a strategic move that fills a critical gap in identity security. This acquisition enhances Palo Alto's platformization strategy, which aims to consolidate cybersecurity services for customers. The article suggests that market concerns about the deal's cost were short-sighted and that the move positions the company for significant long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century due to the impacts of climate change. A study led by the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen suggests North American caribou are at the highest risk, with a potential population drop of up to 80%. Using fossil records and computer models, scientists found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses an unprecedented threat. The decline could also have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and increased carbon release from Arctic soils.</p>

The announcement comes after the Trump administration took steps to overhaul the cultural institution, with Trump becoming the board's chairman and his allies appointed to key positions. The president, who will host the December gala, also outlined plans for physical renovations to the center, stating his administration has reversed its decline. This marks a significant shift from his first term, during which he skipped the annual honors ceremony amid criticism from artists.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's takeover, Afghanistan is reportedly experiencing a rise in tourism, partly driven by social media influencers showcasing the country in a positive light. Despite a Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory from the U.S. State Department warning of kidnapping and wrongful detention, some influencers have posted videos highlighting the nation's hospitality. However, critics and human rights advocates argue this is a public relations strategy by the Taliban to project an image of stability. They emphasize that the reality for Afghan women, who face severe restrictions, is starkly different from the curated experiences of foreign visitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has announced an expansion of its employee discount program to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods. The 10% discount, previously limited to produce and general merchandise, will now apply to 95% of store items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. This move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about increased consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit is also seen as a strategy to boost employee morale, retain workers, and encourage them to shop at Walmart.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the company operating the Zelle payment network. The suit alleges that EWS designed Zelle without adequate safety features, which enabled scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims the company knew its platform was susceptible to fraud due to a lack of verification steps but failed to implement meaningful safeguards. James is seeking restitution for victims and a court order to mandate stronger anti-fraud measures, while a Zelle spokesperson dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt."</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers are considering their options for relief. The article explores the possibility of negotiating directly with creditors as an alternative to hiring a debt relief company. While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and knowledge of debt laws. The process can be stressful and complex, with potential pitfalls such as negative credit score impacts and tax consequences on forgiven debt. For those unequipped to handle these challenges, professional services may offer valuable expertise and established creditor relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece contrasts Nixon's pragmatic, if sometimes reluctant, environmentalism with the current political climate. It highlights a 1971 conversation where Nixon expressed pro-business sympathies to auto executives while acknowledging the reality of pollution, framing it as a complex balance that has since evolved into a more polarized debate.</p>

Any extension beyond that requires a joint resolution from both the House and Senate.

          <p>President Trump responded dismissively to reports that Russia was at least partially responsible for a recent hack of the U.S. federal court's electronic document system. When asked about the breach, Trump remarked, "Are you surprised?" and added, "They hack in, that's what they do." The hack, which reportedly compromised sealed records, was revealed just days before Trump's scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump suggested that the U.S. is "actually better at" hacking and indicated that he might bring up the incident during their meeting in Alaska.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear the majority of the costs from tariffs, despite facing sharp criticism from President Trump. After Trump suggested the bank's CEO should "get a new Economist," a Goldman economist reaffirmed the firm's research on CNBC. The analysis predicts that consumers will absorb about two-thirds of the tariff costs by the fall, potentially pushing a key inflation metric higher. The firm believes this will be a one-time price level effect and may not significantly alter the Federal Reserve's path, given rising concerns about the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has shown skepticism regarding the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland. The lawsuit challenges a standing order that temporarily pauses the deportation of migrants who are challenging their removal in court. During a hearing, the visiting judge questioned the necessity of this extraordinary legal action, noting that the administration could have pursued other avenues, like appealing an individual case. Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the suit is a politically motivated attempt by the executive branch to sue a co-equal branch of government and limit judicial power.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams has been awarded a wildcard entry into the US Open, set to make her 25th appearance at the tournament. At 45 years old, she will become the oldest singles player to compete at the event since 1981. Williams returned to professional tennis in July after a 16-month absence, winning a match at the Washington Open. Her return to a major tournament has sparked discussion, with some seeing it as a celebrated opportunity for an all-time great and others arguing it blocks a spot for a younger, developing player.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is facing a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers, a deficit contributing to summer travel delays. A key issue is the high failure rate at the Federal Aviation Administration's sole training facility, where roughly 35% of students do not complete the intensive course. In response, the FAA is implementing a mentorship program, streamlining its application process, and installing modern immersive tower simulators to improve training outcomes. The agency is also expanding partnerships with colleges to allow students to complete basic training locally, though full certification still requires years of on-the-job experience.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a lower court's decision, giving the Trump administration the authority to proceed with cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid funding. In a 2-1 decision, the D.C. Circuit court ruled that the nonprofit organizations that initially sued lacked the legal standing to bring the case under the Impoundment Control Act. The majority opinion sidestepped the question of the cuts' constitutionality, focusing instead on procedural grounds. The dissenting judge criticized the decision, arguing it facilitates the executive branch's unlawful behavior and undermines the balance of power between government branches.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge ruled that the suspension of $584 million in funding violated a previous injunction that had blocked the National Science Foundation from terminating grants at the university. The funding freeze is part of the administration's response to pro-Palestinian student protests on campuses, which the government alleges allowed antisemitism. The University of California is also reviewing a separate $1 billion settlement offer from the administration to resolve the dispute.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Guardian argues that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police is a move based on false pretenses and fits a pattern of authoritarian behavior. The author points out that despite the president's claims of a city overrun by crime, official data shows that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low and continues to decline. The piece suggests this action is a manufactured crisis intended to expand executive power and could serve as a blueprint for federal intervention in other cities, regardless of actual crime rates.</p>

This financial report comes just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and the company raised its full-year revenue guidance, citing that demand for its AI services continues to outweigh supply.

The VA's press secretary disputed the report's reliability, calling its methodology subjective and not based on actual vacancy data.
