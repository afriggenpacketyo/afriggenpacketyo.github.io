          <p>This article provides firsthand accounts from Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, two survivors of attacks by the serial killer David Berkowitz, known as the "Son of Sam." Violante was shot on his first date, losing his sight but surviving, while his date Stacy Moskowitz died from her injuries. Denaro was also shot and seriously wounded months earlier, with doctors placing a metal plate in his head. Both men reflect on how the 1970s attacks irrevocably changed their lives, the terror that gripped New York City, and their relief upon Berkowitz's eventual arrest.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, Idaho prosecutor Bill Thompson stated that investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a second weapon being used in the murders of four university students, citing injuries on one victim that appeared distinct from the primary knife wounds. Thompson also theorized that the suspect, Bryan Kohberger, spared a surviving roommate because he panicked and was in the house longer than anticipated. The prosecutor emphasized the critical role of DNA evidence found on a knife sheath at the scene, suggesting a conviction might have been difficult without it.</p>

          <p>Clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators have led to fifteen arrests across England during protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers. Demonstrations occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police imposing special conditions in London to keep the opposing groups separated. In response to the situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the number of people housed in hotels. The government aims to cease using hotels for asylum seekers by 2029, a move projected to save £1 billion annually.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is active in a mountainous region of western Montana for a U.S. Army veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda. The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, allegedly opened fire at The Owl Bar, where he was a known regular, before fleeing the scene. Authorities have located his getaway vehicle but the gunman remains at large, and residents have been urged to stay indoors. The bar's owner stated he believes the suspect, who lived next door, simply "snapped" as there were no known disputes with the victims.</p>

The Dodgers ultimately lost 4-0, but Snell's outing was seen as an encouraging sign for the team's late-season rotation depth.

          <p>Reigning 100-meter world champion sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was arrested for a fourth-degree domestic violence offense following an alleged altercation with her boyfriend at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. According to a police report, airport security cameras captured Richardson grabbing her boyfriend's backpack and shoving him into a wall. The report noted that her boyfriend, fellow sprinter Christian Coleman, declined to participate in the investigation. Richardson was booked into a correctional facility and released the following day, just before competing at the U.S. track and field championships.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok as a primary source for news, favoring short, engaging videos from content creators over traditional media outlets. This article examines the trend, profiling "newsfluencers" like Aaron Parnas who deliver rapid-fire updates, and noting the rise of news skits and meme-based content to explain current events. While users value the convenience and simplified terms, the platform's algorithm-driven feed and the potential for misinformation raise questions about the quality and accuracy of the information being consumed. The phenomenon challenges traditional definitions of news and journalism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 13:45:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted the Trump administration's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that while the administration can continue to deny discretionary asylum, it cannot use the president's proclamation to suspend laws that protect migrants from being deported to countries where they would face torture or persecution. These protections, known as "withholding of removal," have a higher legal threshold but are mandatory. The ruling limits the administration's ability to summarily expel all migrants without hearing claims for certain humanitarian protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that using such broad profiles to detain individuals violates the Constitution's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked widespread fear and protests. This decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before making a stop.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his own performance as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprising pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance to the final qualifying round. A downcast Hamilton stated his poor driving was to blame, not the car, continuing a trend of qualifying struggles in the 2025 season. Despite his personal frustration, he congratulated Leclerc and the Ferrari team on achieving their first Grand Prix pole of the year.</p>

          <p>Officials have issued a public warning to avoid the water near the Camp Richardson resort at Lake Tahoe's southern shore after a sewage leak led to the detection of high levels of E. coli bacteria.

The alleged forgeries include the names of three deceased individuals and others who claim they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to collect them.

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after hitting a record high on Monday. The downturn was fueled by a confluence of unsettling news, including a much weaker-than-expected July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions. This data intensified criticism of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates. The week was also marked by President Trump's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariff rates and the positioning of nuclear submarines in response to Russian threats, keeping investors on edge.

          <p>This article explores several behavioral signs that may suggest someone is struggling financially, despite appearances. Key indicators include a lack of a formal financial plan, a tendency to spend heavily on brand-name items to project wealth, and confusing high income with actual wealth. The piece notes that nearly half of Americans earning over $100,000 a year live paycheck to paycheck. It advises readers to focus on budgeting, avoid impulse purchases, and pursue consistent, long-term investment strategies rather than get-rich-quick schemes to build genuine financial security.

          <p>England's Red Roses rugby team achieved a commanding 97-7 victory against Spain, running in 15 tries in a one-sided match. However, the win was overshadowed by a red card issued to captain Marlie Packer in the second half for a clumsy clearout. The incident means Packer may miss some of England's initial pool-stage matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Despite the captain's dismissal, England's performance demonstrated their overwhelming strength as they continue preparations to be tournament favorites, with one final warm-up match against France remaining.</p>

A sitting lawmaker, local officials, and national guard personnel were allegedly caught taking kickbacks of up to 30% on state contracts. This announcement comes just two days after the agencies' independence was restored by parliament following massive public protests against a government attempt to bring them under state control.
