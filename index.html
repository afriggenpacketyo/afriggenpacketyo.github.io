          <p>The UK government is developing a list of US products for potential retaliatory tariffs in response to President Trump's new import taxes.

The list encompasses approximately 27% of US imports into the UK, chosen for their limited economic impact.  The UK government emphasizes ongoing negotiations with the US, but reserves the right to impose retaliatory tariffs if a deal isn't reached.</p>
