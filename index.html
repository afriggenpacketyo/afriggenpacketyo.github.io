            <p>Federal investigators allege that a Wisconsin teenager, Nikita Casap, murdered his parents as part of a plot to assassinate former U.S. President Donald Trump. According to court documents, investigators discovered antisemitic writings detailing Casap's plans to kill Trump and overthrow the government. The suspect is accused of first-degree intentional homicide and other felony counts, including hiding a corpse and identity theft, after his parents were found dead at their home. Authorities also stated that the teenager paid for a drone and explosives to use in an attack and had plans to escape to Ukraine.</p>

While soldiers are not being deployed to collect rubbish, the government is providing office-based military personnel with operational planning expertise.

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the U.S. to completely cancel reciprocal tariffs as trade tensions between the two largest economies persist. This comes after Trump announced a 90-day pause on global tariffs, while simultaneously increasing levies on Chinese imports to 145%. While the Trump administration announced exemptions for some electronic products, including those produced in China, the US Commerce Secretary stated that such exemptions would only be temporary, injecting uncertainty into the situation. China's commerce ministry had called the exemptions a "small step" by the US, and said that Beijing was "evaluating the impact" of the move.</p>

            <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping currently have no scheduled plans to speak amidst the escalating trade war between the two nations. This announcement comes despite Trump's recent imposition of a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher reciprocal tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. China has responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods, leading to increased tensions and uncertainty in the global market. Greer maintains that the U.S. is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global strategy.</p>

Brown also suggested that the world is moving from a unipolar order dominated by the US to a multipolar one.</p>
