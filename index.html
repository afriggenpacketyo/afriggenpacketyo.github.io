          <p>Ulta Beauty and Target are ending their shop-in-shop partnership, which will see over 600 Ulta locations removed from Target stores by August 2026. The collaboration, launched in 2021, was intended to drive traffic to Target, but its termination comes as the big-box retailer faces declining sales, falling store traffic, and a stock value less than half its 2021 peak. An analyst suggested that operational issues at Target, such as theft and insufficient staffing, may have contributed to the decision. The move presents another challenge for Target as it prepares for a leadership transition and seeks to regain momentum in the competitive retail market.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling its entire stake in Coterra Energy, an investment originally intended as a hedge against energy price spikes. The company's strategy of shifting between crude oil and natural gas production has proven ineffective this year, as it consistently had the wrong commodity for market demands. Compounding the issue, the overall price dynamics for energy have been weak, and potential geopolitical shifts could further depress prices. The sale will result in an approximate 8% loss on the position for the charitable trust. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A hiker has died in Tennessee's Savage Gulf State Park after being bitten by a timber rattlesnake, one of the state's four venomous snake species. According to emergency officials, a witness reported that the man had picked up the snake, which then bit him on the hand. The hiker was transported to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries, with officials suggesting an allergic reaction as the likely cause of death. Authorities advise the public to remain calm, avoid handling snakes if encountered, and seek immediate medical attention if bitten, though fatalities from such bites are rare.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" branding deal, citing a "strategic evolution" rather than human rights concerns. The club will instead focus on a youth football academy partnership in Kigali. Critics argue the change was forced by fan and media pressure over Rwanda's human rights record and alleged involvement in the conflict in DR Congo. The move is seen by some as a public relations maneuver, especially as Bayern signed a new deal with Emirates Airlines just days earlier, continuing a trend of major European clubs forming partnerships with nations that have questionable reputations.</p>

Police were called to a residence where the girl was found unresponsive; she later died in the hospital. The suspect was also arrested in connection with a separate sexual assault allegation involving a 16-year-old girl. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive, and police are treating the 13-year-old's death as unexplained pending a complex and lengthy investigation, while providing support to her family.</p>

          <p>AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, recently reaching a market valuation of over $430 billion. A significant portion of its growth is fueled by government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, its international commercial revenue has declined, raising some analyst concerns. The company's valuation is exceptionally high compared to its revenue, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Monterey Car Week auctions, a key barometer for the classic car market, are expected to see a third consecutive year of declining sales, with totals estimated between $367 million and $409 million. The slowdown is most pronounced at the high end, with only one car estimated to sell for over $10 million, a significant drop from previous years. Experts attribute this trend to a generational shift, as baby boomers downsize and a new wave of millennial and Gen Z collectors favors newer, more practical supercars from the 1980s and beyond. This has led to falling prices for pre-1970s vehicles while demand for modern classics skyrockets. (not investment advice)</p>

This narrow reversal of a seven-year trend is likely influenced by the growing popularity of STEM subjects, which are taken by a higher proportion of boys. Mathematics, the most popular A-level, saw continued growth and a widening gender gap, with boys accounting for nearly two-thirds of entries. While humanities subjects have declined in popularity, more girls overall achieved at least an A grade due to higher female participation in A-levels.</p>

The piece frames the action as part of a broader right-wing war on diverse, Democratic-leaning cities and a distraction from other issues, such as the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child trafficker and perpetrator of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and placing its police under federal control is a move made possible by the capital's unique legal status. As a federal district and not a state, the president has authority over the D.C. National Guard and can take control of its police force during emergencies under the Home Rule Act. Legal experts note this direct intervention would be far more difficult, if not impossible, in other major cities like New York or Los Angeles, where state governors command their own National Guard units. The move is seen by critics as a political power grab, as federal data shows violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low.</p>

The owner, Amy Tran, cites a combination of factors including gentrification that has displaced residents, a series of costly burglaries and assaults, and a decline in foot traffic following recent ICE raids that have stoked fear in the immigrant community. The closure represents a significant loss for the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents, who relied on the market for fresh, affordable produce.

          <p>The concept of "genius" has been a subject of fascination and debate for centuries, evolving from a belief in an innate guiding spirit to a scientific quest to identify its origins. This article traces the historical narrative through The Atlantic's archives, noting how the definition shifted with cultural and scientific developments. It highlights the dark turn this quest took with the rise of eugenics, pioneered by Francis Galton, which attempted to link genius to heredity and race. While modern genetics acknowledges that intelligence is partly heritable, the making of a genius is now understood to be far more complex, involving personality, social conditions, and luck.</p>

          <p>As high interest rates and living costs strain budgets, many are considering debt forgiveness and debt management for relief, though the two strategies are distinct. Debt forgiveness, often for those in severe financial hardship, involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount, but it can damage credit scores and create a tax liability. Debt management, suitable for those with steady income struggling with high interest, involves a credit counseling agency negotiating lower rates to create an affordable repayment plan that preserves credit. The better choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals.</p>

          <p>This photo essay captures the destructive power of wildfires that have been raging across Southern Europe, from Portugal to Turkey, over the past two weeks. Fueled by a severe heatwave and strong winds, the blazes have prompted a massive response from thousands of firefighters and volunteers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The plant-based meat industry's two leading companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are pursuing different strategies to revive a stagnant market. Facing criticism that its products are overly processed, Beyond Meat is simplifying ingredient lists, launching a neutral-flavored "Beyond Ground," and rebranding to just "Beyond." Conversely, Impossible Foods is doubling down on a "meaty" identity, launching more indulgent products and sticking with its heme ingredient for a realistic taste, betting that flavor is the key driver for consumers. The success of these divergent approaches could shape the future of meat alternatives and their potential to impact animal welfare and the environment.</p>

The King and Queen will attend a service of remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum, where a national two-minute silence will be observed. His message is expected to reflect on the broadcast made by his grandfather, King George VI, 80 years ago, and will acknowledge the suffering of both prisoners of war and civilians. VJ Day, on August 15, marks the surrender of Japan in 1945, which officially ended World War Two.</p>

          <p>As he prepares for a summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump has stated he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested a subsequent meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be decisive, where they could potentially "divvy things up," a term that may cause concern in Kyiv. European leaders, who met with Trump via video call, were reportedly reassured that he would focus on securing a ceasefire rather than negotiating a final settlement over Ukraine's head. The summit is a critical test of Trump's personal diplomacy and Putin's willingness to negotiate.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), has been dismissed amid severe operational and financial turmoil. Dr. Richard Lutz, who led the company since 2017, departs as DB faces plummeting punctuality, with over a third of long-distance trains arriving late last year, and persistent annual losses despite price hikes. Germany's new government has pledged to restructure the railway's management and modernize the country's deteriorating transport infrastructure.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is increasing the UK list price of its popular weight-loss drug Mounjaro by as much as 170% for those paying privately. This means a month's supply of the highest dose could rise from £122 to £330, although the price the NHS pays will not be affected due to a separate discounted rate. Eli Lilly stated the initial UK price was significantly below the European average and that the increase aligns it more consistently for fair global contributions.

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, fell sharply after it announced that new tariffs will significantly impact its profits in the coming fiscal year. The company forecasts that higher duties will cost it $160 million, leading to a full-year earnings projection below analyst expectations. The financial headwinds are partly due to the suspension of the de minimis rule, which had allowed items under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. Despite the profit warning, Tapestry anticipates low single-digit revenue growth and noted that consumer demand has remained strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point since October and the fourth consecutive weekly decline. This decrease in borrowing costs provides a much-needed boost in purchasing power for prospective homebuyers, potentially revitalizing a housing market that has been sluggish since early 2022. The fall in rates is linked to a lower 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate next month. The easing rates have already led to a jump in mortgage applications, particularly for refinancing.</p>

The unexpected data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, creating a dilemma between taming potential inflation and stimulating the economy.
