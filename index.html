          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a long-awaited minerals deal, granting Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for establishing a reconstruction investment fund. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this economic partnership would enable both countries to jointly invest in accelerating Ukraine's economic recovery and help facilitate the end of the war. The agreement signals to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term. Ukrainian officials emphasized that Ukraine retains control over its resources and that the fund will be split 50-50 between the two countries, reflecting an equal partnership.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be able to compete in women's football in England starting June 1. The decision follows a UK Supreme Court ruling defining womanhood based on biological sex, leading the FA to amend its rules. The FA stated that only those born biologically female will be permitted to play, acknowledging the difficulty this poses for transgender women who wish to participate in the sport. The association is contacting registered transgender women to explain the changes and explore ways for them to stay involved in the game.</p>

          <p>Manchester United faces a potentially dire financial situation if they fail to qualify for the Champions League, with projected losses impacting their transfer strategy and overall attractiveness to players. Missing out on European football could lead to wage reductions for players and further strain the club's already substantial debt, which hovers around £1 billion. Sir Jim Ratcliffe previously stated the club would have gone 'bust' without significant action, highlighting the urgency of navigating back into contention at the top of the Premier League. Despite plans for a £2 billion stadium, the club must remain compliant with Premier League financial rules, making their task even more challenging.</p>

          <p>Two outlook reports suggest that growing economic risks and uncertainties will keep gold prices high for the remainder of the year. First-quarter demand for gold reached its highest level since 2016, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst geopolitical tensions and financial market volatility. Professor Chen Zhiwu of the University of Hong Kong attributes the rise in gold prices to President Trump's erratic exercise of power, which has made the US dollar less trustworthy. Central banks have continued to add to their gold reserves, marking their 16th consecutive year as net purchasers of gold.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal granting Washington access to Ukraine's natural resources, establishing an investment fund to support Ukraine's economic recovery. The deal does not require Ukraine to repay any supposed debt to the US, a condition previously demanded by Trump. The agreement includes provisions for new oil and gas projects, along with minerals, while maintaining Ukrainian ownership of resources. Profits from the investment fund will be fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy for the first decade, and the US acknowledges Ukraine's EU ambitions, ensuring the deal does not conflict with them.</p>

He believes reaching the $1 trillion cost-cutting goal is possible but requires overcoming resistance from the federal bureaucracy. Musk characterized the bureaucracy's default as spending what was done last year plus 5%, making change difficult and creating enemies.</p>

          <p>Senior Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev asserted that the minerals deal between Ukraine and the United States implies that President Trump has compelled Kyiv to pay for future U.S. military aid with its mineral resources. Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Ukrainians will now have to use their national wealth to pay for military supplies, describing Ukraine as a disappearing country. The agreement comes as the U.S. expresses frustration with the lack of progress in peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. Meanwhile, former Kremlin advisor Sergei Markov believes the deal will hinder Russia's goals in Ukraine by justifying new spending on the war.</p>

The board argues that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, potentially altering the character of American government. The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimacy and the legality of some of his policies. The board identifies attacks on the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, and freedom of speech as key threats to democracy.</p>

          <p>Apple's significant dependence on Chinese suppliers and sales has made it vulnerable to potential disruptions caused by trade tensions, with some analysts estimating that its value could be halved in a complete breakdown of U.S.-China relations. Despite efforts to diversify production to India, Vietnam, and Thailand, a substantial portion of iPhones are still made in China. The company faces pressure from the Trump administration to shift manufacturing to the United States, a move that could significantly increase production costs. While Apple is investing in the U.S., relocating its entire supply chain would require a massive effort and investment in infrastructure and skilled labor.</p>

Some countries are standing their ground, while others are seeking new alliances and leaders to cope with an erratic and inward-looking America.

          <p>The British government's attempts to influence golf executives to host the Open championship at President Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland could potentially violate the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause. Ethics experts warn that if the R&A chooses Turnberry and requires public investment, it could be seen as a foreign government providing benefits to a federal official without congressional approval. The British government's attempt to help Trump realize his long-held ambition comes as public documents show Trump appears to have taken control of the trust that controls Turnberry.</p>

          <p>Some people are experimenting with metformin, a drug approved for diabetes treatment, in the hopes of extending their lifespan, despite limited research on its effects on human longevity. While research on mice has shown varying results, early evidence suggests that metformin could manage or delay cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia. However, experts caution that the evidence for its anti-aging abilities in humans is weak and that the drug carries potential risks, including kidney problems. This article explores the growing interest in metformin for longevity and the ongoing scientific debate surrounding its effectiveness and safety.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, with the money never being returned. This practice is part of a new dynamic on the southern border, where states like Texas are taking a larger role in immigration enforcement. While county officials argue they are deterring illegal crossings and providing justice for landowners, critics claim the county is profiting from the misfortunes of migrants seeking a better life.
