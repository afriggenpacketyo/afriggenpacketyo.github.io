          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has set a new world record as the youngest female chess player to defeat a grandmaster. She achieved this milestone during the British Chess Championships by beating 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, has been hailed as a brilliant and composed prodigy. Experts believe she has the potential to become a women's world champion or even the overall world champion in a sport traditionally dominated by men.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) reported an $8 billion write-down on its "gigaproject" investments, such as the futuristic Neom city, despite its total assets growing to nearly $1 trillion. The decline is attributed to lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit, which has forced the kingdom to scale back some of its ambitious Vision 2030 projects. The fund's annualized returns have dropped, and it is increasing its focus on domestic investments and high-growth sectors like AI. This signals a shift in strategy as the kingdom grapples with economic realities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin is being held in Anchorage, Alaska, a location chosen for its geographical convenience and shared historical ties. Alaska, once a Russian colony sold to the U.S. in the mid-19th century, holds both American and Russian heritage, including Russian Orthodox communities. The state's strategic military importance, particularly during the Cold War, is highlighted by the summit's venue at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. This meeting occurs in a location where Putin is safe from an international arrest warrant, as the U.S. does not recognize the International Criminal Court.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Logistics experts are cautioning that significant price increases for consumers, driven by the Trump administration's tariffs, have not yet fully materialized because the excess inventory is currently stored in warehouses. U.S. importers rushed to front-load freight to avoid higher rates, creating a bottleneck in the "middle mile" of the supply chain. This buildup has strained warehouse capacity and is expected to lead to noticeable price hikes on store shelves in the coming months, particularly for holiday season items. This situation is transforming supply chain management from a line item into a major boardroom-level concern for many companies. (not investment advice)</p>

She joked that the podcast acted as his "personal dating app" after he famously spoke about failing to give her a friendship bracelet at her concert. Travis credited the Eras Tour for inspiring him, stating that listening to her songs gave him a "roadmap" on how to win her over. Swift found the public gesture charming and compared it to an '80s movie, revealing it led to their connection.</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers led by Professor Daniela Rus are advancing AI for humanoid robots, aiming to make them capable of performing tasks in human-centered environments. They are training a robot named Ruby by capturing data from humans wearing sensors, which teaches the machine nuanced movements like how tightly to grip an object. Rus envisions AI and robots as tools that give people "superpowers," extending physical reach and refining precision. While acknowledging public unease, she emphasizes that safety is a priority, with every machine including a stop button.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit in Anchorage is framed by the complex history between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, which has been marked by both deference and recent frustration from Trump. Past meetings, notably the 2018 Helsinki summit, saw Trump publicly siding with Putin's denial of election interference over the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies. While Trump has recently expressed irritation with Putin over the war in Ukraine, he remains optimistic about brokering a peace deal, suggesting a "feel-out meeting" could lead to a larger summit with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Analysts express concern that Putin may exploit Trump's transactional approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice and the SEC have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that allegedly defrauded investors, including military veterans, of over $200 million. Ryan Wear, former owner of Water Station Management, is accused of selling investors water vending machines that often did not exist and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier ones. The second man, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, is accused of facilitating the scheme by purchasing over $100 million in bonds from Wear's company while concealing his personal financial stake.

The law, which is broader than a recent Texas ruling on pornographic sites, applies to platforms like Facebook and Instagram and also requires parental consent for minors. Tech industry group NetChoice had sued, arguing the law unconstitutionally restricts free speech by creating censorship requirements for vague categories of content.

This has weakened the high end of the market, with only one car this year estimated above $10 million. The market is rotating towards newer, more affordable classics. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest this reversal is partly due to the rising popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are studied by significantly more boys than girls and tend to award a higher proportion of top grades.

          <p>Rebecca Young, a schoolgirl from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for inventing a device to help homeless people. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores heat during the day to provide warmth at night. Her idea won a national engineering competition, and the engineering firm Thales developed it into a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is in partnership with Lego, Rebecca has also been immortalized as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Federal Takeover of Washington D.C. is an Act of Staggering Hypocrisy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is a hypocritical power grab based on false pretenses about crime. The author, Rebecca Solnit, points out the irony of Trump, whom she holds responsible for the Jan. 6th violence, claiming to restore order in a city where violent crime is actually at a 30-year low. The move is framed as part of a broader rightwing war on cities, which are seen as hubs of diversity and progressive values that threaten conservative ideology. The author connects the action to a pattern of authoritarianism.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why Trump's Federal Intervention in D.C. May Not Be Replicable in Other Cities</h2>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. has been labeled an "authoritarian push," but legal experts explain why such a move would be difficult to replicate elsewhere. Because Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state, the president has direct authority over its National Guard and can assume control of its police force during emergencies under the Home Rule Act. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard troops, and the Posse Comitatus Act generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, creating significant legal hurdles.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last traditional grocery markets in Los Angeles' Chinatown, is closing after 18 years, succumbing to a combination of pressures. Owner Amy Tran cites a decline in foot traffic due to gentrification, the lingering effects of the pandemic, and fear in the immigrant community following recent ICE raids as major factors. The decision was solidified by a series of burglaries and assaults at both the store and the family's home. The closure marks the loss of a vital community hub that provided affordable, fresh produce to the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has threatened a lawsuit of over $1 billion against Hunter Biden for claiming she was introduced to her husband by the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a legal letter, her lawyers called the claim "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," demanding a retraction and apology. Biden made the comment in a recent interview, attributing it partially to journalist Michael Wolff, and has since defended his statement, appearing unwilling to back down. The claim originates from a now-retracted article, and there is no evidence to support the assertion.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have detained numerous Afghan refugees in Islamabad, including individuals who were approved for relocation to Germany as part of a program for those at risk under Taliban rule. The arrests are part of a broader crackdown that began in 2023, with Pakistan aiming to deport millions of Afghans. Human rights groups and German officials have expressed alarm, as some detainees have reportedly already been sent back to Afghanistan, where they could face persecution. The German government has confirmed it is aware of the situation and is in contact with Pakistani authorities.</p>

          <h2>Producer Price Index Surges, Signaling Potential for Tariff-Driven Consumer Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 12:59:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% in July, its largest jump in over three years and far exceeding economists' forecasts. This surge suggests that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to significantly increase costs in the supply chain, with economists warning that these hikes will soon be passed on to consumers. While consumer prices have been slow to rise, this report indicates that businesses' ability to absorb tariff costs may be diminishing. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on whether to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
