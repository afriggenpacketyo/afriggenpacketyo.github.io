          <p>General-lieutenant Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior Russian general, was killed by a car bomb just outside Moscow, prompting a murder investigation. The explosive device, packed with metal fragments, detonated in the town of Balashikha, east of Moscow. Moskalik was the deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff and had been a Russian military representative at the "Normandy format" talks on Ukraine in 2015. The attack resembles previous incidents targeting individuals linked to Russia's military operations in Ukraine, though Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for this specific event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for its approach to scientific research, including budget cuts and personnel changes.

          <p>Donald Trump, in his second term, is seeking to revive a nuclear agreement with Iran, despite having withdrawn the U.S. from the original deal in 2018. Indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman, are underway between U.S. and Iranian officials. Trump's approach contrasts with his first term, where he adopted a hardline stance against Iran. His current strategy involves leveraging economic incentives and appealing to Iran's desire for economic benefits, potentially leading to a deal that avoids military conflict and addresses the nuclear crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump's renewed immigration enforcement policies have found stronger public support compared to his first term, driven by concerns over increased migrant influx under the Biden administration. A recent poll indicates that nearly half of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of immigration, with voters expressing openness to stricter measures. This shift is evident in areas like northern New Jersey, where Trump gained significant support in the last election. However, some supporters worry that Trump's policies, such as deporting immigrants without criminal records, are excessive.</p>

          <p>The article warns of the potential return of stagflation, a combination of economic stagnation and inflation, under President Trump's economic policies. The author argues that Trump's tariffs are acting as self-inflicted oil shocks, disrupting the economy and leading to higher prices and potential shortages. The author suggests that Trump's interventions could lead to further economic distortions and potentially capital controls. The piece paints a grim picture, drawing parallels to the economic turmoil of the 1970s and warning of the difficulties in escaping stagflation once it takes hold.</p>

Some suggest that social media and the concertification of DJ sets contribute to the problem, while others point to factors like venue space and gatekeeping.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing imports of U.S. soybeans and corn as part of negotiations with the U.S. regarding tariffs. Japan aims to absorb excess U.S. supply resulting from decreased exports to China due to trade friction. This move is intended to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. The proposed expansion would require cooperation from domestic agricultural groups to shift imports from Brazil to the United States.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that annual energy bills in the UK will fall by Â£166 in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator Ofgem's price cap. The typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit is expected to be Â£1,683. The fall is attributed to a decrease in the wholesale cost of energy, influenced by US tariffs policy and warmer weather in Europe. Despite the predicted drop, analysts caution that uncertainty remains in the energy market.</p>
