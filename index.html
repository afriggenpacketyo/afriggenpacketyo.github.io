          <p>Following Angela Rayner's departure, the contest for the UK Labour Party's next deputy leader is underway, with several prominent figures announcing their candidacy. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, senior MP Emily Thornberry, and the recently dismissed Lucy Powell have all joined the race. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from fellow MPs, a process some critics within the party have called unfair. The competition highlights different ideological wings of the party, with candidates discussing key issues like the war in Gaza, welfare cuts, and the party's overall direction under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has publicly released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a 'birthday book' compiled for his 50th birthday. The book contains a page with a message and signature attributed to Donald Trump, which the former president and the White House have vehemently denied as fake. This release intensifies the political controversy surrounding Trump's past association with Epstein, prompting renewed scrutiny and public debate. The documents also include messages from other high-profile individuals, though many names and photos have been redacted for privacy.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, which is central to its economic development goals. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed emphasized that the dam is a source of prosperity and electrification for the region and poses no threat to downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan. Despite these assurances, both countries have long expressed concerns that the dam could jeopardize their water supply from the Nile River. The $5 billion project, funded almost entirely by Ethiopia, is seen as a major national achievement and a symbol of self-reliance.</p>

          <p>London-listed Anglo American and Canada's Teck Resources have agreed to a 'merger of equals,' a move that sent Anglo's shares surging by nearly 10%. The new combined entity, to be named Anglo Teck, will become one of the world's top five copper producers and will be headquartered in Canada. The deal is structured to give Anglo American shareholders a 62.4% stake in the new company.

          <p>The discovery of a 500-pound unexploded bomb from World War II during construction work has led to significant evacuations in downtown Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Emergency measures included closing a major bridge over the Danube River and halting all traffic and public transportation during the morning rush hour. Experts were called to the scene to defuse the device. The area was the site of an oil refinery that was heavily targeted by Allied bombing raids in 1944, making such discoveries a recurring issue in the city.</p>

          <p>A U.S. congressional committee has released a redacted version of a 'birthday book' created for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, alongside his will and contact lists. The book contains messages from numerous powerful figures, including a note with a signature resembling Donald Trump's and another message seemingly from Bill Clinton. The release comes amid bipartisan pressure for more transparency regarding Epstein's network of associates. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, wrote the introduction to the book, which she said she enjoyed putting together for him.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data indicates that the Democratic Party is facing historically low favorability ratings, with over 60% of American adults viewing it negatively. This widespread dissatisfaction stems from multiple sources, including frustration among Democrats who perceive their party as weak and ineffective in opposing President Trump. The analysis also points to deep ideological divisions within the party regarding its future direction, as well as the general unpopularity of its key leaders. Despite these negative trends, Democrats still hold a slight advantage in generic congressional ballot polling, suggesting voters may distinguish between individual candidates and the national party brand.</p>

          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better loan terms. Financial experts recommend focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Another key strategy is to increase the down payment, with a 20% down payment not only reducing the rate but also eliminating the need for private mortgage insurance. Finally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a significantly lower initial rate.

          <p>The trend of institutional investors, like private equity firms, buying single-family homes to convert them into rentals has become a contentious issue in the U.S. housing market. This practice, which gained momentum after the Great Recession, is criticized for driving up home prices and making it harder for middle-class families to achieve homeownership. However, research reveals a surprising nuance: by increasing the supply of rental homes in suburban areas, these investors are also making neighborhoods more affordable and racially diverse for lower-income families who were previously priced out. This creates a complex trade-off between homeownership aspirations and rental accessibility.</p>

          <h2>Apple to Unveil New iPhone Models Amid Potential Price Increases from Trade Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple is set to reveal its next iPhone lineup, with widespread speculation that the company may announce price increases for the first time in five years. The potential price hike is attributed to the ongoing trade war and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods manufactured in China. The new models are not expected to feature significant technological leaps, which has led to concerns about Apple's pace of innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence. This launch places CEO Tim Cook in a difficult position, balancing consumer pricing, profit margins, and political pressure to move manufacturing to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The long-standing succession battle within the Murdoch family's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control. Under the deal, Lachlan will oversee a new trust, while his three older, more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in Fox or News Corp. This resolution ensures the continued conservative direction of major media outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal after Rupert Murdoch's death, ending years of internal family turmoil and litigation.</p>

          <p>This commentary asserts that recent political rhetoric, such as President Trump's statement that some people are 'born to be criminals,' echoes the dangerous and discredited pseudoscience of eugenics. The author draws a direct line from these modern statements to the historical eugenics movement, which promoted the idea of 'fit' and 'unfit' populations and led to policies like forced sterilization. The article argues that these once-fringe ideas are re-emerging in contemporary discourse, particularly in debates over crime, public health, and social welfare, signaling a troubling return of deterministic and discriminatory thinking.</p>

          <p>Dan Brown, author of the global phenomenon 'The Da Vinci Code,' is releasing his most ambitious novel yet, titled 'The Secret of Secrets.' The book moves beyond religious iconography to explore the cutting edge of brain science, focusing on noetics and the radical concept of nonlocal consciousness—the idea that the brain acts as a receiver for a consciousness that exists externally. Brown spent eight years researching the topic to craft a thriller where this scientific frontier becomes a potential tool for world domination, blending complex factual research with his signature high-stakes, puzzle-solving narrative style.</p>

          <p>In his new book, researcher Elliot Haspel argues that to achieve a robust federal child-care system, advocates must reframe the issue as a moral right and a fundamental American value, akin to public schooling. He contends that the prevailing economic argument—that child care is primarily a tool to help parents work—is 'morally impoverished' and fails to build the broad-based coalition needed for transformative change. Instead, the focus should be on the wider societal benefits, such as strengthening families, communities, and even national security, to create a more compelling case for public investment.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical parallels between the Trump administration's current immigration raids and the forgotten history of the forced expulsion of Chinese immigrants from Northern California in the 1880s. A historian argues that the purges, which saw white mobs violently drive out Chinese communities, represent a dark chapter of 'cruel forced deportations' that resonates with today's tactics targeting Latino immigrants. The story of Dock Rigg, a Chinese man who was one of the few allowed to remain, serves as a poignant reminder of this period of intense racism and state-sanctioned exclusion.</p>

The ruling is described as creating a class of second-class citizens, where legal status offers no protection from suspicion and harassment.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to major U.S. cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., has ignited a fierce debate about the use of military force for domestic law enforcement. While the administration frames these actions as necessary to combat crime and support immigration agents, critics warn it is a dangerous step toward authoritarianism that blurs the line between military and civilian roles. The use of militaristic rhetoric and imagery, combined with sending troops into cities against the wishes of local leaders, has raised fundamental questions about presidential power and the erosion of democratic norms.</p>
