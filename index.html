          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly stated that the Constitution entrusts Congress and the states, not the President, with the authority to regulate federal elections. The judge found that the executive order exceeded presidential authority and attempted to circumvent Congress's deliberative process. The ruling is a victory for voter registration groups and Democrats challenging the executive order, which they argued could disenfranchise millions of eligible voters.</p>

          <p>Several companies, ranging from Chipotle to Procter & Gamble, are expressing concerns about President Trump's tariffs, projecting they will negatively impact profits and consumer spending. The tariffs are leading to higher prices on key commodities and increased uncertainty, causing consumers to pull back on spending. Despite a temporary pause in higher rates, the situation remains volatile, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipating a de-escalation in the trade war with China. Some companies are considering raising prices to offset higher costs, while others are seeking exemptions from the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old New Jersey man, Joseph Kling, has been charged with arson and aggravated arson for allegedly starting the Jones Road Wildfire. The fire, which grew to 15,000 acres, prompted thousands of evacuations and shut down a major highway. Authorities stated that Kling left a bonfire unattended in the Forked River Mountains wilderness area, leading to the blaze. Firefighters continue to battle the fire, which is about 50% contained, utilizing fire engines, bulldozers, helicopters, and ground crews.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding funds from sanctuary cities. The lawsuit was brought by San Francisco and other local governments, arguing that the funding cuts would cause irreparable harm. The judge agreed, stating that the threat to withhold funding causes budgetary uncertainty, undermines trust, and deprives cities of constitutional rights. This ruling is similar to a previous case where San Francisco successfully sued the Trump administration over its sanctuary policies.</p>

This is causing concern for recipients like Maurine Gentis, a retired teacher who relies on Meals on Wheels for meals and regular check-ins.

          <p>A study published in Communications Biology provides the first evidence-based explanation for how female bonobos gain and sustain dominance over males. Researchers tracked six bonobo communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo over nearly 30 years and found that females form coalitions against males to tip the balance of power in their favor. When a male bonobo steps out of line, nearby females will band together to attack or intimidate him, leading to a loss of social rank for the male and better access to food and mates for the female adversaries.</p>

Experts characterize the situation as a game of chicken, with both sides appearing unwilling to unilaterally de-escalate.

Trump claimed that representatives from both countries had a meeting, but declined to disclose their identities. The Trump administration is also considering possible exceptions for some Chinese auto parts. This comes after China dismissed Trump's assertions of progress towards a trade deal as "fake news."</p>

The IMF has downgraded its global growth forecast, citing the trade war as a major risk, and is urging China to boost domestic demand and reduce intervention in its economy.</p>

          <p>David Thomas, the frontman for experimental rock band Pere Ubu, has died at the age of 71 after a long illness. Thomas was a key figure in Cleveland's experimental rock scene, first gaining prominence with Rocket From the Tombs before forming Pere Ubu in 1975. Pere Ubu's unique sound, characterized by arty dissonance, ponderous rhythms, and Thomas's idiosyncratic vocals, made them a highly influential post-punk band.
