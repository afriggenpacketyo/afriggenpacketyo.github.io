          <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the United States are in talks to establish a “minerals-for-security” deal, aiming to curb violence in the DRC and challenge China's dominance in the mining industry. Kinshasa has proposed granting the US access to its extensive mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees, military support, and increased American investment, reducing reliance on China. This arrangement would enable Washington to use diplomatic and economic tools to foster peace while securing critical minerals, potentially creating a new competitive front with China in the region.</p>

A subsequent traffic jam led to a truck rear-ending the stopped traffic, causing the third fatality.

          <p>Spanish car-part supplier Gestamp is increasing its investments in China's automotive sector, bucking the trend of international firms reducing their presence due to overcapacity and intense competition. Gestamp plans to pursue acquisition opportunities, focusing on safety and lightweight technologies for electric vehicles (EVs). The company aims to strengthen relationships with Chinese car manufacturers, positioning itself as a partner for both domestic and international ventures. This strategy contrasts with many foreign carmakers who are losing ground to local rivals amidst a brutal price war.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have expressed shock and opposition to a proposed peace deal from the Trump administration that would involve formally recognizing Russian authority over Crimea. While acknowledging the likely need to cede territory temporarily, Ukrainian officials insist that formally surrendering Crimea is politically, legally, and constitutionally impossible. Such a move would require a nationwide vote and could be considered treason, with lawmakers and the public firmly opposed to the idea, instead Ukraine seeks security guarantees from NATO.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has engaged with world leaders, seemingly to build support for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of being linked to the attack. Despite not officially identifying any specific group responsible or presenting concrete evidence, Indian officials have briefed diplomats on Pakistan's history of supporting terrorist groups. These briefings reference technical intelligence, including facial recognition data, allegedly connecting the attack's perpetrators to Pakistan.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws parallels between historical tyrants and Donald Trump, suggesting that, like his predecessors, Trump's rule will inevitably end. The author examines various potential mechanisms for his removal, including impeachment, the 25th Amendment, public disapproval, and legal challenges. Ultimately, the piece suggests that Trump's own incompetence, greed, and self-destructive tendencies may be the most significant factors in his eventual downfall, but that the situation is nonetheless perilous for those at home and abroad.</p>
