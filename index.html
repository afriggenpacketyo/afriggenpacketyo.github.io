          <p>Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night host based in Los Angeles, has criticized President Trump's response to the protests in the city, likening him to an "arsonist with a hose." Kimmel suggested that the president, rather than the protesters, is the source of the city's problems. He sarcastically noted that Los Angeles experiences more unrest when its sports teams win championships than during the current demonstrations. The comedian's remarks reflect growing tension between the Trump administration and the city over immigration policies and the use of federal forces. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a trade deal with China has been reached, contingent upon final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping. Trump stated the U.S. would receive 55% tariffs, while China would be subject to 10% tariffs, also noting that China will supply necessary rare earths upfront. Chinese state media reported that both countries had agreed to a trade "framework" during talks in London, following previous discussions in Geneva and a phone call between the two leaders. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick described the agreement as a "handshake for a framework," emphasizing the need for both leaders to approve the concessions made. (not investment advice)</p>

V-JEPA 2 can recognize basic physical phenomena, such as a ball falling off a table or an object remaining present even when hidden.

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News discusses the unexpected reconciliation between President Trump and Elon Musk, arguing that their collaboration is crucial for America's competitiveness in the global technology race. The author suggests that while their feud may have caused market jitters, their renewed partnership could be a secret weapon against China's growing dominance in industries like electric vehicles, battery technology, and artificial intelligence. Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, are highlighted as key drivers of American innovation, and Trump's policies could help facilitate their success. The author emphasizes that America's strength lies in bottom-up ingenuity, and the partnership between Trump and Musk could be essential for maintaining a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to gradually reduce states' dependence on FEMA assistance following the current hurricane season, arguing that governors are better equipped to handle natural disasters. Trump criticized FEMA's effectiveness and proposed shifting responsibility to the state level, similar to education, with governors collaborating to support each other. This initiative follows previous efforts to downsize FEMA and establish a review council to assess its disaster response capabilities. However, concerns have been raised about FEMA's readiness for the hurricane season, with internal reports indicating potential derailment due to staffing and contractor changes.</p>

          <p>An opinion columnist in the New York Times argues that President Trump's decision to deploy troops to address protests in Los Angeles is a sign of weakness rather than strength. The author suggests that Trump's administration lacks a comprehensive policy program and relies solely on blunt force, demonstrating a compromised political position. The article contends that strong regimes do not typically meet protests with military force, and the Trump administration's escalation highlights its inability to handle dissent effectively. The author suggests that the administration's actions reflect a desire to consolidate power through fear, but ultimately reveal its underlying fragility.</p>

She spent six weeks in therapy, rediscovering her passion for football and life, and emphasizing the importance of seeking professional help for mental health issues.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that AI art cannot match human creativity because generative AI models struggle to represent sensory experiences. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the ability to understand concepts like a flower in the same way humans do, due to the absence of sensory and motor components. The study indicates that AI's creativity is "hollow and shallow" because it cannot replicate the richness of human sensory experiences. While AI can produce outputs that meet minimal definitions of creativity, they lack the depth and emotional connection found in human-created art.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles, with its large undocumented immigrant population and history of activism, has become a focal point for protests against President Trump's immigration policies. The decision to send troops to the city has been criticized as a deliberate provocation, particularly given LA's well-established pro-immigration networks. The protesters, often children and grandchildren of immigrants, are fighting against what they perceive as fascism and militarism, drawing on a long history of organizing against government attempts to criminalize undocumented workers. The city's demographics and history of civil rights battles make it a strategic location for Trump to stage a spectacle and undermine California's economy.</p>

Texas Republican lawmakers have held preliminary discussions on the topic, with potential targets including up to five seats currently held by Democrats. However, some Republicans are wary of the potential risks, including legal challenges and Democratic gains in a wave election. The move is considered unusual but not unprecedented, as Texas Republicans pushed through an early redrawing of maps in 2003.</p>

          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether the surge in Chinese exports to the bloc is a result of the high US tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially prompting emergency measures. This assessment comes after a significant drop in Chinese shipments to the United States in May, coinciding with a rise in exports to EU countries like France and Germany. Despite the trade spikes, the European Commission states that it's too early to definitively conclude that trade diversion is occurring. The EU is using a new customs surveillance system to monitor trade flows and determine if any harm is being caused to EU industries.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities following immigration raids ordered by President Trump, leading to hundreds of arrests and the deployment of thousands of troops. The demonstrations in LA began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, resulting in clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Other cities, including San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, New York, and San Francisco, have also seen protests, with varying levels of violence and arrests. Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to LA, triggering a dispute with state officials who claim the situation is under control.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated that he regrets some of his social media posts directed at President Trump, admitting that they "went too far." This comes after a public fallout between the two, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill and unverified claims about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump had previously responded by threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX. Musk's expression of regret follows Trump's statement that he was open to reconciliation and believed Musk felt "very badly" about his previous remarks.</p>
