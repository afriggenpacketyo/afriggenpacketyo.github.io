          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges related to conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights and due process. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties, asserting that he has no criminal history in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration had previously alleged that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. The Supreme Court had previously ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.</p>

Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for the murder of James Appleton and a 50-year sentence for the sexual assault of Amy Harrison, with DNA evidence linking him to the unsolved sexual assault case from 1997.</p>

          <p>Visitors attending the UK-wide Open Farm Sunday event are being warned about the risk of cryptosporidium, a parasite causing gastrointestinal illness.

Inspection reports reveal that some farms repeatedly ignored health inspectors' advice, allowing children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions.

          <p>During his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump claimed he would eliminate the national debt in eight years, referring to himself as the "king of debt." Now, the rising national debt is a focus again, with GOP defectors expressing concerns that Trump's spending package will increase the debt by roughly $3 trillion over the next decade. Elon Musk has criticized the bill, arguing it undermines efforts to cut spending, leading to a public feud with Trump.

The investigation gained momentum in 2020 when German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters announced evidence suggesting Madeleine was dead and identified Christian Brückner as a suspect. The recent search focused on derelict buildings in the Algarve, driven by the need for more evidence to charge Brückner.</p>

Trump allies suggest Musk's attacks on Trump were too personal, potentially alienating him from the MAGA crowd, while some Republicans express concern about the split's impact on their agenda.</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional. The court found that teaching yoga constitutes protected speech, overturning a previous ruling.

The decision has been celebrated by instructors and participants who view outdoor yoga as a valuable service for those who cannot afford classes elsewhere.</p>
