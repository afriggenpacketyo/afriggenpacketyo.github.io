          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 04:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine is increasingly turning to unconventional solutions like interceptor drones to counter a surge in Russian air attacks. Faced with thousands of advanced Russian Shahed drones that can evade traditional defenses, Ukrainian forces are ramping up the production and deployment of these specialized interceptors. This strategic shift is driven by both tactical necessity and economic reality, as an interceptor drone costs around $5,000 compared to an anti-aircraft missile that can cost up to $1 million. This approach aims to provide a more sustainable and effective defense for Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>As former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a self-critical farewell speech to his Social Democratic Party, the UN Refugee Agency head expressed concern over Germany's decision to suspend its participation in a key refugee resettlement program. The program, which helps particularly vulnerable individuals, was halted after a recent government change. In his speech, Scholz defended his government's policies, including strengthening the military in response to Russia's aggression, and called for greater solidarity in financing national defense. The developments signal significant political and policy shifts within Germany.</p>

          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy in a remarkable state of preservation, including a full head of dark brown hair. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to a woman from the Chancay culture, which predates the Inca Empire by several centuries. The discovery highlights the rich archaeological heritage of the Peruvian coast, where the dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains. The city of Lima alone is home to approximately 400 archaeological sites, making such finds not uncommon.</p>

This move angered her Social Democratic colleague, who is responsible for nuclear safety.

          <p>Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is scheduled to visit the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in July. This significant visit will include tours of the memorial museums and other sites related to the 1945 atomic bombings. According to sources, Frydnes may also meet with some of the aging atomic bomb survivors, known as hibakusha. The trip underscores the Nobel committee's continued focus on nuclear disarmament and serves as a powerful gesture of historical remembrance and peace advocacy.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama, Japan, have left for China following the expiration of their loan agreement. The departing pandas include the 24-year-old matriarch Rauhin and her three offspring, Yuihin, Saihin, and Fuhin. Their return to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan Province is a significant event for the popular Japanese zoo. The departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in the entire country, marking a notable moment in Japan-China "panda diplomacy."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has put forward a proposal to regulate the international trade of all eel species under the Washington Convention, an international treaty protecting endangered wildlife. This move aims to curb the decline of eel populations but faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eel. If adopted, the restrictions would take effect in 2027 and require exporting countries to issue permits proving the eels were captured legally. The proposal sets the stage for a significant debate over conservation and international commerce.</p>

          <p>The residents of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes in Dorset, are facing eviction after the estate they live on was sold for approximately Â£30 million to an anonymous buyer. The new owner, registered as a limited company, has ordered residents to leave and terminated public access to the 800-hectare grounds. This situation is highlighted in the article as a stark example of the power imbalance in rural England, where concentrated, often anonymous, wealth can displace entire communities and override local interests, creating a profound sense of powerlessness.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been officially charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm. The charges come after a ten-month investigation involving what police describe as a "double-digit" number of alleged victims. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title and is the princess's son from a prior relationship, has previously admitted to issues with substance abuse and violence. His defense attorney stated that Hoiby takes the accusations seriously but denies wrongdoing in most cases.</p>

          <p>As a record-breaking heatwave sweeps across the United States, child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the deadly risk of leaving children in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from heatstroke in cars, with experts noting that a vehicle's interior temperature can rise by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes. Authorities stress that these tragedies are preventable and can happen to anyone, urging parents and caregivers to create routines, such as leaving a personal item in the backseat, to ensure they never forget a child.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic semi-remote draft drew criticism for its format, with some executives like Kings General Manager Ken Holland expressing a preference for the traditional, in-person event. The new setup, with teams in their home markets and draftees in a theater, was marked by technical glitches and a slow pace. Critics like Holland argue that the remote format diminishes the celebratory atmosphere and the special moment for young players, particularly those drafted in later rounds who would have been present at a centralized event.</p>

While the White House has hinted at a possible extension, it has shown no sign of removing the sector-based tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum, creating continued economic uncertainty for its key Asian ally.

Despite the win, the team's performance was far from perfect, marked by a short outing from the starting pitcher and defensive errors. The game was secured by Shohei Ohtani's 29th home run and a tense, game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning. The result reflects a team that, in the words of its manager, is finding ways to win without yet playing its best baseball.</p>
