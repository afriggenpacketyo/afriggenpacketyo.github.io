          <p>Craig Moffett, a leading analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, suggesting it won't effectively mitigate the impact of tariffs. He argues that because iPhone components would still be sourced from China, the move would not significantly reduce costs and could face resistance. Moffett also anticipates backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, potentially affecting iPhone sales as consumers opt for local competitors, and lowered his price target for Apple stock due to these concerns.</p>
