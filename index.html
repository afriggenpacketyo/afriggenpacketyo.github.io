            <p>Following a Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney acknowledged the anxiety and uncertainty felt by the trans community. The ruling stated that biological sex defines a woman for the purposes of the Equality Act, impacting single-sex spaces. Protests erupted in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh as activists demanded trans rights and criticized the court's judgement. Swinney stated his government would accept the ruling and focus on protecting the rights of everyone, emphasizing the need to adjust to the circumstances while ensuring inclusivity.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced an "Easter truce" in Ukraine, ordering a cessation of military action from Saturday evening until midnight on April 21, with the caveat that Russia would respond to any Ukrainian violations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded cautiously, calling the proposal a manipulative tactic while noting ongoing Russian attacks. Negotiations involving U.S. officials have been ongoing in Paris to discuss ending the war, but Moscow has signaled it's in no hurry to strike a deal. The proposed truce comes as a previous 30-day ceasefire intended to pause strikes on energy infrastructure targets has expired.</p>

            <p>The New York Rangers have fired head coach Peter Laviolette and associate head coach Phil Housley after a lackluster season where the team missed the playoffs despite high expectations. General manager Chris Drury cited the team's failure to meet expectations as the reason for the change, despite Laviolette having a 94-59-11 record in his two seasons. The Rangers had their best regular season in franchise history with Laviolette in the 2023-2024 season. Drury indicated that a search for a new head coach would begin immediately, signaling a potential roster overhaul.</p>

Ocado stated that the comments were made by a temporary contractor and did not reflect the company's views. The apology followed a Supreme Court ruling that defined a woman by biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>

            <p>This opinion piece explores the negative stereotypes surrounding stepmothers in popular culture, drawing on historical and psychological perspectives. The author argues that these stereotypes, perpetuated by fairy tales and media, can deter women from dating parents and create fear of being perceived as "wicked." However, the article suggests that children often harbor conflicting emotions towards their mothers, and stepmothers can find worth in forming genuine connections and pursuing true love despite societal expectations. The author encourages mothers looking to date not to let the fear of being a wicked stepmother hold them back.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point amid widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and increased pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express greater disapproval of his economic policies. The public also disapproves of his handling of inflation and federal government spending, while tariffs are viewed negatively by a majority of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A survey reveals that Britons spend significant time dealing with inefficient customer service systems, leading to widespread frustration. The frustration extends across both public and private sectors, with booking NHS appointments being particularly annoying. The survey suggests that this "call fatigue" has a political dimension, potentially driving voters towards parties advocating for systemic change. The author notes that the private sector's cost-cutting measures, like outsourcing customer service, contribute to the problem.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's efforts to expand coal mining while simultaneously cutting funding for miner health and safety agencies has drawn criticism. Advocates express concern that the cuts will endanger miners, especially as black lung cases increase.

Critics argue that these measures prioritize coal production over the well-being of workers.</p>

The discovery was made by firing laser pulses into the eyes of participants, stimulating specific cells in the retina. While some experts are skeptical, calling the discovery a "matter of interpretation," researchers believe the findings could further research into colour blindness. The colour, named "olo," is said to be more saturated than any colour visible in the real world.</p>
