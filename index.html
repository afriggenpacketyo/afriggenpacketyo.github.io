          <p>The arrest of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a key Erdogan opponent, triggered widespread protests across Turkey.  The event led to a significant drop in the Turkish lira and a reported record sale of foreign currency by the central bank to stabilize the currency.  The government denies the arrest is politically motivated, while critics view it as a severe blow to Turkish democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advocating for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to mitigate the economic impact of his tariff policies.  This comes after the Fed's decision to maintain its key interest rate, signaling potential future reductions.  Trump's stance contrasts with his earlier hands-off approach to Fed policy.</p>

          <p>A Chinese Academy of Sciences study forecasts a significant decrease in China's control of the global rare earth market within the next decade.  The study projects a decline in China's share from 62% to as low as 23% by 2040, due to the emergence of new mining sources in other regions. This suggests a potential reshaping of the rare earth industry.</p>
