          <p>Apple has increased trade-in prices for iPhones in China to stimulate demand in a key market where it faces stiff competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. The iPhone 15 Pro Max trade-in value has risen to 5,700 Chinese yuan ($791), up from 5,625 yuan, as Apple seeks to galvanize sales amidst declining market share. Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year in the first quarter, with its smartphone market share decreasing from 15% to 13%, according to Canalys data. The company is also navigating supply chain challenges and considering shifting more production to India, although this strategy faces its own set of political pressures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a 7% fall in energy prices for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, marking the first price drop in a year. This reduction will decrease the annual bill for a typical household using gas and electricity by £129, bringing the average bill down to £1,720. While charities welcome the decrease, they emphasize that many people still struggle to pay their energy bills, with customers collectively owing about £4 billion to suppliers. The regulator attributes the price drop to a fall in the international price of wholesale gas, although prices remain high compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated in the South China Sea as China deployed water cannon against Philippine vessels near Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands.

China urges the Philippines to cease its infringing actions, asserting its rights to protect and enforce laws in waters under its jurisdiction.

The Trump administration contends that some schools have become bastions of antisemitism and ideological indoctrination and has been attempting to change the culture of American higher education by withholding federal funding.

          <p>Concerns have emerged regarding why President Joe Biden was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade, leading to a late and aggressive diagnosis. While Biden's aides claim that doctors stopped PSA testing in 2014 in line with US regulations for men over 70, critics argue that presidents receive more rigorous medical care. Medical experts suggest that stopping all testing at 71 seems premature for a man in high public office, especially with new, more accurate tests available. The news has sparked controversy, particularly in light of Biden's history of health cover-ups and cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>A private jet crashed into a San Diego neighborhood in foggy weather, killing a music talent agent and five others. The plane hit a power line and slammed into a home, igniting several vehicles and causing extensive damage. Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among the deceased, and the agency expressed their devastation. The crash destroyed one home, damaged others, and prompted the evacuation of at least 100 residents. The NTSB is investigating the incident, which originated from Teterboro, New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration decision to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could severely impact the university's sports teams. Many of Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams rely heavily on international athletes, with some teams potentially losing the majority of their players. The Department of Homeland Security claims Harvard has created an unsafe campus environment, but the university calls the action unlawful. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students to transfer or leave the country.</p>

Reflecting on leading the club to its 20th top-flight title in his first year succeeding Jurgen Klopp, Slot emphasized the importance of avoiding excuses. He drew comparisons with his time at Feyenoord, where he won the Eredivisie in 2023 despite an overhaul of his team. This week, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lamented how red cards and injuries impacted their title bid.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to explore a face-to-face meeting in June during the G7 summit in Canada, hoping for productive tariff negotiations. In a 45-minute phone conversation, both leaders agreed on the need for "win-win" bilateral relations through these negotiations. This call preceded another round of ministerial tariff talks in Washington, with Japan urging the U.S. to rethink its tariff policy, which includes a 25 percent import duty on cars, due to concerns about its impact on Japan's export-driven economy.</p>

Chinese carmakers contributed to much of the growth in BEV sales, jumping 59% year-on-year despite EU tariffs.

          <p>The term "DEI hire" is being used to undermine individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, feeding an age-old grievance and creating a climate where prejudice can be voiced more openly. This taunt feeds a lurking sense that someone has a job that could have been yours and feeds the nagging voice of doubt already lurking inside the most outwardly confident of people. The author argues that social media has turned whispers into a public barrage of sexist or racist abuse, chipping away at confidence. The article stresses the need to prevent these prejudices from spilling back into real-life conversations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office turned confrontational, with Trump making false claims of genocide against white farmers.

Protesters condemned the event as a corruption of the presidency, while attendees admitted they hoped to influence U.S. financial regulations.
