          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a temporary halt to his government's anti-tariff advertising campaign in the United States. The decision came after President Donald Trump publicly criticized the ad, which quoted former President Ronald Reagan, and declared that trade negotiations were terminated. Ford stated the TV spots, which ran on major U.S. networks, would be paused starting Monday to allow for the resumption of crucial trade discussions between the two countries. The move is intended to de-escalate tensions and reopen diplomatic channels for resolving the ongoing trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of leading a major international fentanyl trafficking operation, has been extradited from Cuba to the U.S. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which Zhang had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege Zhang ran a sophisticated drug distribution and money laundering network across several states, working with Mexican cartels to import fentanyl and cocaine. His extradition marks a significant development in the U.S. effort to dismantle international networks supplying the deadly synthetic opioid.</p>

          <p>Over 20 allied nations supporting Ukraine have committed to eliminating Russian oil and gas from the global market to cripple funding for Moscow's war efforts. Following a summit in London, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the plan, which builds on recent sanctions against Russia's largest energy companies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the summit, reiterating the need for increased pressure on Russia. While the coalition also pledged to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses, no new commitments for long-range missiles were announced, a key request from Kyiv.</p>

The deployment follows formal requests from the Republican parties in both states, which cited concerns about potential voting irregularities.

          <p>Senior administration officials indicate that President Donald Trump is likely to name the new, privately funded $300 million White House ballroom after himself. The project, which involved demolishing the entire East Wing, has reportedly raised $350 million in donations, with officials already referring to the space as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom." When questioned, the president did not confirm the name but stated he has contributed millions of his own money to the project. The branding is consistent with his lifelong practice of naming his major construction projects after himself.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt has been launched in the UK after Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu was serving a 12-month sentence and was scheduled to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Authorities have initiated an urgent investigation into the error, and an officer has been suspended from discharge duties. Police have tracked his movements to a London-bound train, and both the government and opposition leaders have expressed outrage over the unacceptable security lapse.</p>

          <p>The Department of War has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation intended to pay U.S. service members' salaries amid the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump announced the contribution came from a "friend" who wished to help offset the impact of the funding lapse on the military. However, legal experts note that congressional appropriation is typically required to distribute such funds for salaries, creating uncertainty about how the money can be used. This donation comes as the administration seeks solutions to ensure troops are paid, a key point of contention during the budget stalemate.</p>

          <p>The UK's director of public prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case collapsed because a senior national security official would not testify that China was considered an "enemy" of the state. In a letter to Parliament, Stephen Parkinson explained that the official's unwillingness to use this specific legal term was "fatal to the case" against two men accused of spying for Beijing. The prosecution required proof that the defendants' activities were prejudicial to the state and that the UK government viewed China as hostile during the period of the alleged offenses. The official's stance reflected that calling China an enemy was not official government policy.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% anticipated by economists. This report, released by the Department of Labor despite the government shutdown, is crucial for determining the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Economists suggest that while President Trump's tariffs are contributing to upward price pressures, businesses are absorbing some of the cost, muting the full impact on consumers. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, though analysts still widely expect a rate cut to support a slowing labor market.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the waters off Latin America, significantly escalating the U.S. military presence in the region for its anti-narcotics campaign. This deployment dramatically increases the resources available to U.S. Southern Command for detecting and disrupting illicit trafficking activities. The move follows a series of deadly U.S. strikes against suspected drug-smuggling vessels operated by cartels in the Caribbean and Pacific. The Ford, the Navy's newest and largest aircraft carrier, will join eight other U.S. vessels already operating in the area.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged over 30 individuals, including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, in a major gambling scandal linking the NBA to organized crime. The indictments allege two interconnected schemes: one involving the use of inside player information for betting on games, and another involving rigged high-stakes poker games. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Nothing But Bet," is the most significant corruption crisis to hit a major U.S. sports league since the broad legalization of sports betting, raising serious questions about the integrity of the game.</p>

          <p>A fourth Metropolitan Police officer, PC Jason Sinclair-Birt, has been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed for a BBC Panorama investigation. A disciplinary panel found that he gave a false account of using excessive force on a detainee, boasting about the incident to an undercover reporter for "comedic effect." Although body-worn camera footage showed he did not use his baton as claimed, the panel ruled that sharing a false account that reveled in violence was a serious breach of professional standards. Three other officers implicated in the same investigation were dismissed a day earlier.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has dismissed President Trump's proposal to send National Guard troops to San Francisco as "laughable," stating there is no pretext for such an action. Newsom asserted that the city is effectively confronting crime, pointing to data showing a 70-year low in the homicide rate and an overall decline in violent crime. He confirmed that a lawsuit was prepared to immediately block any such deployment. President Trump later stated he called off the plan after speaking with local leaders who asked for a chance to address the issues themselves.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required surgery to remove 80 to 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested, which caused part of his bowel to be removed. The magnets, purchased online, had clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains and causing pressure necrosis, or tissue death. Doctors highlighted the severe danger of swallowing multiple magnets, which can lead to serious internal injuries. Despite a ban on the sale of such magnets in New Zealand, they remain easily accessible through online retailers, posing a significant safety risk.</p>

In his statement, Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to representing all New Yorkers. The endorsement solidifies establishment Democratic support for Mamdani, who maintains a strong lead in the polls against his opponents, former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has set the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) at 2.8%, providing a modest increase in monthly payments for approximately 71 million beneficiaries. This adjustment will boost the average monthly benefit by about $56, to $2,071, starting in January. The increase is slightly higher than last year's 2.5% but comes as inflation remains a concern for seniors on fixed incomes. Advocacy groups warn that the raise may be largely consumed by projected increases in Medicare premiums, which are deducted directly from Social Security checks.</p>

          <p>American consumer confidence fell for the third straight month in October, signaling a growing pessimism about the economy due to a weakening labor market and persistent inflation.

Inflation expectations also rose, indicating that the strain of high prices remains a primary worry for households.

While a joint review found no evidence that their presence interfered with the medical exam, it concluded their actions created a perception of interference and disregarded protocol requirements.

In the film, which stars Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield, Mehiel plays a queer and trans character whose identity is part of their life but not the central conflict of their story. Mehiel, who previously won a Sundance acting award for the film "Mutt," emphasizes the importance of portraying complex, messy queer characters in high-profile projects. They believe such nuanced representation helps create connection and understanding in a challenging political climate.</p>
