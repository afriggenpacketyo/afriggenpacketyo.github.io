Despite recent talks in Istanbul, Ukraine asserts that Russia's position remains unconstructive and that Moscow is stalling to avoid American sanctions. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for Russia to feel the consequences of the war and bear the losses, while former Russian President Medvedev suggested the talks aim for Russia's victory and the destruction of Ukraine's government. Meanwhile, long-range strikes continue, with both sides reporting drone activity and Senator Graham is pushing a sanctions bill through the Senate to put financial pressure on Russia.
