            <p>Over 100 people were killed, including 20 children and nine aid workers, in attacks on famine-hit camps for displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region. The attacks were carried out by the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher. The offensive has forced approximately 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher. The UN has condemned the attacks and called for an end to the violence. Optimism Score: 0</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariffs are creating panic buying and paralysis among consumers, with some stocking up on goods while others feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty. The tariffs, including a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices for clothing, electronics, and toys. Economists predict a potential economic slowdown and rising unemployment due to the tariffs. Consumers are facing increased costs and are unsure how to navigate the changing economic landscape.

The government's likely next step is to nationalize the Scunthorpe plant, which employs 2,700 people. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated that the move was necessary to prevent the owners from shutting down the furnaces, which would have ended primary steel production in the UK. The government hopes to secure private investment to save the plant, but public ownership is the likely option. Optimism Score: 65</p>
