          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 2026, a crucial race for control of the Senate. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family, and he has committed to working alongside Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee can win. Kemp's decision leaves the field open for other potential candidates to challenge Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, who is considered vulnerable. The article notes Kemp's popularity in Georgia and his past victories against Stacey Abrams and a Trump-backed primary challenger.</p>

          <p>Palantir Technologies increased its revenue guidance after experiencing a significant boost in both commercial and government revenue, driven by the rising adoption of its artificial intelligence software.

Palantir is forecasting U.S. commercial revenues to exceed $1.178 billion this year, with Karp attributing the growth to increased adoption of its tools within the U.S. defense sector and a surge in demand for large language models.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is scaling back its policy on recovering overpayments, reducing the clawback rate from 100% to 50% of a beneficiary's monthly check. This change follows concerns that the previous policy caused financial hardship for many recipients, especially disabled workers who rely heavily on their benefits. The SSA's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to errors in the agency's own calculations. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, some advocates argue that taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden for vulnerable individuals.</p>

Legal experts emphasized that the Fifth Amendment protects all "persons," not just citizens, and that Trump's oath of office requires him to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.
