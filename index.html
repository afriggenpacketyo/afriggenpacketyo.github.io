According to his spokesperson, he suffered a fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations, and other injuries but is reportedly in good spirits. The incident occurred after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was a victim of domestic violence. His spokesperson confirmed that the crash was not a targeted attack and asked for privacy during his recovery.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, against the housing of asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel resulted in at least two arrests after clashes with police. Approximately 200 people gathered, and authorities had implemented a dispersal order to manage the demonstration. The protest follows recent tensions in the community after an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexual assault, a case which is currently proceeding through the courts. Police officials reiterated their commitment to facilitating lawful protest while taking firm action against any criminal activity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, strongly criticized a federal appeals court decision that ruled most of the administration's sweeping tariffs are illegal. The court found that the president overstepped his authority, placing a key part of his economic agenda in jeopardy, though the tariffs remain in effect pending a likely Supreme Court appeal. Navarro described the ruling as "weaponized partisan injustice" and warned of dire consequences for the country if the decision is upheld. The administration remains optimistic about its chances before the Supreme Court. This article is about governmental financial regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, forcing officials to deplane the children and return them to government custody. Immigrant advocates had filed a lawsuit arguing the deportations were illegal and deprived the minors of their right to seek asylum and other legal protections. The judge's 14-day restraining order applies to all unaccompanied Guatemalan children in U.S. custody who do not have a final deportation order.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in a key early-season Premier League match, thanks to a late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai. The game at Anfield was largely a cautious and tactical affair, with both teams showing significant respect for one another. Arsenal's conservative approach was criticized for failing to challenge a Liverpool defense that has appeared vulnerable in previous games. The win gives Liverpool an early advantage in the title race, extending Arsenal's long winless streak at the historic stadium.</p>

In response to the federal plans, Chicago's mayor has already signed an executive order limiting cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities.

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order that would mandate identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that is expected to face immediate constitutional challenges.

Critics argue that such laws disproportionately affect minority, low-income, and disabled voters, while proponents claim they are necessary to prevent fraud.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy. This tragic event follows government warnings about declining vaccine uptake, with none of the main childhood vaccines in England meeting the 95% target last year. Health officials are using this case to re-emphasize the critical importance of vaccination for pregnant women to provide passive immunity to newborns before they are old enough to receive their own jabs.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the 40th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner, with the last jackpot being won on May 31. While the top prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including four tickets in Massachusetts that won prizes of $1 million and $50,000. The next drawing for the massive jackpot, one of the largest in the game's history, is scheduled for Monday night.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels raided the offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF in Sanaa, Yemen, detaining at least one employee. The raids occurred shortly after an Israeli airstrike killed the Houthi prime minister and several other cabinet members, leading to heightened security and tensions in the capital. The UN condemned the arbitrary detention of its staff and is seeking more information from local authorities. This event represents a significant escalation in the Houthi's crackdown on international organizations operating within their territory.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is engaged in a public dispute with President Donald Trump regarding crime in Baltimore. Moore stated he has "no interest in fighting with the president, but I have an interest in fighting for my communities," defending his city against Trump's criticisms and threats to send in the National Guard. While acknowledging there is more work to be done, Moore touted recent drops in crime and called the president's comments "arrogant criticism." The feud has also seen Trump resurface a past controversy over Moore's military record, which the governor has strongly refuted.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers held informal talks to brainstorm new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the possibility of secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to produce weapons on EU soil as a "safe haven." Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. While no formal decisions were made, the discussions signal the EU's search for more impactful long-term strategies to sustain Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, a result described by critics as one of the worst encounters between the rivals in recent memory. While Rangers showed defensive resilience and fight, a welcome change for their beleaguered manager, Celtic's attack was notably feeble and lacked creativity. The result leaves Rangers with their worst league start since 1983, but the clean sheet provided some respite. For Celtic, the performance highlighted a pressing need for new attacking players before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>This article details a growing focus from Donald Trump and his allies on reshaping America's public universities. The piece notes that after a year of campus protests, particularly regarding the war in Gaza, there is a concerted effort to influence university governance, curriculum, and policies. Using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a backdrop, the article explores the potential for political pressure to impact these major educational and research institutions. The movement reflects a broader cultural and political battle over the role and direction of higher education in the country.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's president has announced that political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for politicians in an effort to quell nationwide anti-government protests. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage. In addition to reining in allowances, the government will impose a moratorium on overseas trips for officials. The concessions may not be enough, however, as protest leaders state they do not address deeper issues of wages, taxes, and corruption.</p>

          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. Over the past decade, divers have cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the vital kelp forests, which had declined by 80%, to regrow. These underwater ecosystems, known as the "sequoias of the sea," provide critical habitat for hundreds of species and protect coastlines. The project, led by The Bay Foundation, serves as a successful model for marine conservation efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>Many vulnerable Afghans who were promised entry into Germany after fleeing the Taliban are now living in fear of deportation from Pakistan, where they have been waiting for visas. After a months-long pause, Germany is reportedly resuming the admissions process, but a Pakistani deadline for Afghans to formalize their status or leave is expiring. Families who worked for international organizations face grave danger if sent back to Afghanistan. The situation has been exacerbated by German security checks that delayed the processing of already-approved applications, prompting legal challenges and pressure from human rights groups.</p>
