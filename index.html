          <p>Two Israeli embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was apprehended and allegedly shouted "free, free Palestine" after being taken into custody. The FBI is investigating the shooting as a potential targeted attack, sparking outrage and condemnation as an act of antisemitism. Israeli officials have expressed shock and increased security measures at Israeli missions worldwide, while President Trump condemned the killings as an act of antisemitism.

          <p>Jack Teixeira, serving a 15-year sentence for leaking classified U.S. national defense secrets, spoke out from prison, stating he doesn't believe he betrayed his country and would repeat his actions. He claims his intent was to educate the public about undisclosed information and believes his case was politicized by the Biden administration. Teixeira leaked classified documents, including those related to the Russia-Ukraine war and Chinese spy balloons, on Discord. Prosecutors asserted his actions caused grave damage to national security, but Teixeira maintains no one was harmed and feels he was made an example of, while his mother believes the prosecution was malicious and sensationalized.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump surprised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa by raising concerns about the alleged persecution and killings of white farmers in South Africa. Trump played a video featuring anti-white chants and images of crosses claimed to represent murdered farmers, claims which have been widely discredited. Ramaphosa calmly responded, emphasizing that his government's policy is against such sentiments and highlighting the presence of white members in his delegation. The meeting, intended to improve trade relations, took an unexpected turn, with Trump pressing Ramaphosa on land confiscation and violence against white farmers, while Ramaphosa maintained his composure and stressed racial reconciliation.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize a deal handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily halted by a High Court injunction. Two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, filed the case, seeking to return to the islands, which are currently prevented under both existing and proposed arrangements. The agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, with substantial payments expected from the UK to Mauritius. The court order prevents any conclusive steps to transfer the territory until further notice, as representatives of the Chagossian community meet with Foreign Office officials.</p>

The updated version includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, and increases the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000.

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009 while still capable, highlighting the importance of knowing when to step aside. French contrasts Souter's decision with the current trend of politicians and judges remaining in power well into old age, citing examples like President Biden, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Senator Mitch McConnell. He argues that the desire to cling to power is often fueled by enablers who benefit from a leader's position and by a public that prioritizes career success over other values. French concludes by praising Souter's humility and his focus on life beyond the court, suggesting a valuable lesson for current leaders.</p>

Despite a $765 million contract, Soto's performance, though above average, hasn't met the high expectations set by his previous seasons. However, advanced statistics suggest that Soto will likely return to his elite form, as his underlying metrics remain strong. The pressure of playing in New York and adjusting to a new team may be contributing factors, but Soto's track record suggests he will soon demonstrate why the Mets invested in him.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Catholic archdiocese has reached a settlement in its bankruptcy reorganization regarding clergy sexual assault claims, but some attorneys representing over 80 abuse claimants say the deal falls short by $100 million. The agreement, negotiated between the archdiocese and a creditors committee, proposes payments of $180 million to $230 million, significantly less than a similar settlement in the Rockville Centre archdiocese. Attorneys opposing the deal argue that it excludes the majority of survivors and undervalues their claims, while the archdiocese contends it will protect its institutions and offer healing. The proposal involves selling archdiocesan assets, including apartment complexes and Hope Haven, to fund the settlement.</p>

Two studies published in Current Biology detail how scientists collected DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners to locate the specific alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene. The mutation activates the gene in pigment cells, leading to the orange hue, and intersects with the same pathway responsible for red hair in humans, but in a different way. The community partnership with cat owners and spay-neuter clinics was crucial for the study's success and public engagement.</p>

She highlights that until the 20th century, most people died at home, and communities had elaborate rituals to protect the soul and console the grieving. While modern society has medicalized death, there's a resurgence of interest in old ways, such as death doulas and involving loved ones in caring for the deceased. Conisbee argues that embracing mortality can be liberating and encourages a compassionate approach to grief and mourning.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff policy has created a pattern where initially high numbers are later reduced, making lower tariffs feel like a relief. Yair Reiner, a kitchenware seller, described how a reduction from 145% to 30% tariffs on Chinese goods provided some relief, though the 30% tariff is still significantly higher than pre-trade war levels. Experts argue that Trump's tariff shifts have successfully reframed tariffs for investors, despite the current average effective tariff rate being the highest since 1934. The uncertainty caused by these changes creates problems for businesses trying to plan long-term investments.</p>

          <p>Documents obtained by The New York Times reveal a fierce debate among officials in the Trump administration regarding the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a judge's ruling prohibiting it. Officials discussed portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence and attempted to nullify the order barring his deportation. Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who advised bringing Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., was fired. The case has broad implications for Trump's deportation efforts and tests the administration's commitment to the American judicial system.</p>

Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has fallen significantly due to the restrictions. Experts suggest that the curbs are incentivizing China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor production and accelerating the development of local alternatives. They also argue that the restrictions are costing U.S. companies billions in sales and hindering their ability to invest in future innovation.</p>

          <p>The House voted to begin debating Republicans' domestic policy bill, facing challenges to unify fractious ranks and secure enough votes for President Trump's agenda. Speaker Mike Johnson and his deputies are working to win over holdouts through concessions and pressure from Trump. The bill addresses tax cuts, defense spending, and energy policy, but faces opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans. The White House has urged immediate passage, while Democrats denounce the bill as benefiting the wealthy at the expense of social programs. Concessions on Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions aim to garner broader support.</p>

Experts predict that taxes will likely need to rise in the autumn to meet economic rules. Tax receipts increased, but government expenditure rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is estimated at Â£148.3 billion, which is less than initially thought but still more than expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
