          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is poised to sign an executive order, authorizing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines, thereby ensuring swift and convenient healthcare access for all New Yorkers. This decisive action is a direct response to ongoing federal regulatory uncertainties and political debates surrounding vaccine availability, which have led to inconsistent access at pharmacies. The temporary order is designed to provide immediate, seamless access to immunizations while the Governor actively works with the Legislature to establish a comprehensive, long-term solution. This move firmly positions New York to protect its residents' health decisions against any political interference.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for gains as investors keenly anticipate the U.S. August jobs report, a key indicator for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier in the week, global markets experienced a sell-off driven by concerns over government debt and fiscal policies, but sentiment rebounded on Thursday. Recent U.S. payroll data boosted market confidence for a September rate cut, mitigating fears of a severe economic downturn. All attention is now on whether Friday's jobs report will present a "Goldilocks" reading, signaling a labor market soft enough to justify rate cuts. Meanwhile, British retail sales and house prices have also shown positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Kingdom retail sales volumes experienced a 0.6% increase in July, exceeding economic predictions, largely attributed to favorable sunny weather and the popularity of the women's Euro football tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released these figures after a two-week delay, having faced recent scrutiny regarding the accuracy of its data. While July showed a positive monthly trend, sales over the three months leading to July were down by 0.6% compared to the preceding quarter. Initial strong performance in supermarkets, sports shops, and household goods has since moderated, though this was somewhat counterbalanced by a rise in online and clothing sales.</p>

          <p>Italy is becoming a prime destination for the ultra-wealthy, defying a global trend of stricter regulations on the super-rich, thanks to its appealing flat-tax regime and booming real estate market. Despite doubling its one-off charge on foreign income to 200,000 euros in 2024, demand for luxury living and Milan's vibrant business scene remains strong. Milan, in particular, has seen property prices surge by 49% since the flat-tax regime's 2017 introduction, far outpacing other major Italian cities. This influx of high-net-worth individuals, estimated at 3,600 this year, is sparking new businesses and job creation, although critics raise concerns about worsening wealth inequality.

Governor Ron DeSantis' administration, which rapidly constructed the facility to aid President Trump's deportation efforts, hailed the appeals court's decision. Although the plaintiffs remain committed to shutting down the facility, its operations are now back on track.</p>

          <p>Europe is grappling with a prolonged period of geopolitical challenges, with some analysts describing it as a "century of humiliation" as external pressures from leaders like Donald Trump and Xi Jinping intensify.

The continent finds itself increasingly caught between major global powers, struggling to assert its influence and autonomy amidst complex diplomatic and economic maneuvers.

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra unexpectedly departed Thailand, just before a Supreme Court decision that could send him to prison. His exit coincided with a parliamentary vote to elect a new prime minister, necessitated by the recent removal of his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, from office over an ethics violation. Thaksin, who had spent years in exile, returned in 2023 to serve a reduced one-year sentence, raising questions about preferential treatment. This political upheaval has paved the way for construction magnate Anutin Charnvirakul to become the leading candidate for the premiership, indicating a significant decline in the Shinawatra family's long-standing political power.</p>

This policy has already drawn interest from major players like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto, with copper projects alone projected to attract $16 billion.

          <h2>Pentagon Considers Deploying Military Attorneys as Temporary Immigration Judges</h2>

          <p>The Department of Defense is exploring a proposal to deploy as many as 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, a measure intended to address the overwhelming backlog of over 3.4 million cases. This initiative, requested by the Justice Department, follows the Trump administration's recent dismissal of numerous immigration judges. The selected military lawyers, largely from the U.S. Army Reserve, would undertake a rigorous six-week training program in immigration law, procedure, and policy. However, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has strongly condemned the plan, asserting that immigration law is exceptionally complex and that relying on military attorneys without specific expertise jeopardizes due process and the integrity of the immigration court system.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has undergone surgery for skin cancer, an event hinted at by a visible fresh scar on his head in late August. This recent procedure comes months after his public revelation in May that he was diagnosed with stage-four prostate cancer, which had metastasized to his bones and was identified as an "aggressive form" with a high Gleason score of nine. Previously, in 2023, Biden had a basal cell carcinoma removed from his chest, and his wife, Jill, also had similar skin cancers excised. His office has indicated that the prostate cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, suggesting it can be effectively managed with various treatment options currently under consideration.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, a prominent matriarch from a wealthy South Florida family, has been found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation in connection with the 2014 murder-for-hire plot against her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a respected Florida State University law professor, was killed amidst a contentious custody dispute with Adelson's daughter, Wendi, who wished to move their children hundreds of miles away. Prosecutors successfully argued that Donna Adelson meticulously orchestrated the killing after Markel refused the relocation. This conviction is the fifth in the decade-long, high-profile case that has captivated the region with its intricate and disturbing details, with other family members already serving life sentences.</p>

          <p>An Indiana bankruptcy attorney, who happens to share the name Mark Zuckerberg, is taking legal action against Facebook's parent company, Meta, alleging that his account has been repeatedly suspended under false accusations of "impersonating a celebrity." The lawyer, a practitioner for 38 years, asserts that these persistent account shutdowns have resulted in thousands of dollars in lost business. Despite his efforts to verify his identity with photo IDs and credit cards, his account was disabled five times over an eight-year period, only being reinstated after his lawsuit was initiated. Meta has since confirmed the account's restoration and stated its commitment to preventing such errors in the future, acknowledging the unique and frustrating circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, following another drawing without a top prize winner. This article delves into Powerball data, detailing the daunting odds of winning the jackpot at 1 in 292.2 million, and critically examining how state-level income taxes dramatically affect the net payout for winners. Individuals in states such as California, Florida, and Texas, which do not impose taxes on lottery prizes, could potentially receive over $1 billion via annuity or $485 million as a lump sum after federal taxes. In contrast, winners in states with higher taxes, like New York and Minnesota, would see their take-home amount significantly reduced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump intends to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War" through an executive order slated for Friday, designating the new title as a "secondary title." This proposed change would effectively revert the department to its historical name, which it held until 1947 when it was unified and rebranded as the Department of Defense following World War II. Trump has publicly stated his preference for the name "War Department," believing it conveys a more powerful and resolute image. Although the necessity of congressional approval for a permanent name change remains ambiguous, the initiative has already ignited considerable debate regarding its symbolism and the potential financial implications of rebranding the U.S. government's largest department.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's remote southeastern region has been hit by a magnitude 5.6 earthquake, marking the third such tremor in just six days and intensifying an already severe humanitarian crisis. This latest seismic event caused widespread panic and contributed to a rising death toll from Sunday's initial quake, which now stands at 1,368 fatalities and 2,180 injuries across 25 villages. Rescue and disaster relief operations are significantly impeded by the challenging mountainous terrain and extensive landslides, often making helicopters the sole means of reaching affected remote communities. The Taliban government has issued an urgent appeal for international aid, with the UN and UK already committing emergency funds, underscoring Afghanistan's high vulnerability to earthquakes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has formally requested the Supreme Court to grant him the authority to dismiss Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, despite lower courts having previously ordered her reinstatement. Trump is currently appealing a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling which affirmed that FTC commissioners can only be removed for specific cause, such as neglect or malfeasance in office, a reason Trump did not provide for Slaughter's termination. Slaughter, who received unanimous Senate confirmation for a term extending to 2029, has since resumed her duties and publicly stated her commitment to serving her full term. This legal challenge represents the second recent case questioning Trump's power to remove federal regulators without explicit justification.</p>

While visiting Ecuador, Rubio announced the designation of two prominent Ecuadorian criminal organizations, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. These statements come on the heels of a recent U.S. military strike in the Caribbean that reportedly resulted in the deaths of 11 suspected drug traffickers. Rubio underscored a commitment to waging "war" on these groups, yet legal experts have voiced concerns that such aggressive actions, especially unilateral ones against smugglers, could potentially infringe upon international human rights and maritime law.</p>
