          <p>Despite strong first-quarter results from tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, concerns are rising about the digital advertising market's sustainability due to President Trump's trade war. Meta's CFO noted decreased spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters due to trade loophole cessation, while executives at Alphabet and Pinterest expressed similar sentiments about slower Asia-specific ad sales. Snap even pulled its second-quarter guidance, citing macroeconomic uncertainty, and the CEO of The Trade Desk acknowledged the challenging economy, indicating potential ad budget cuts by corporations.

          <p>The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), the primary commuter rail system in the San Francisco Bay Area, was forced to shut down all trains for several hours on Friday morning due to a "computer networking" problem.
