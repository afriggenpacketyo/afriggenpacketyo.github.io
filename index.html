          <p>Microsoft's shares experienced a significant jump following the release of its quarterly earnings report, which exceeded expectations in both earnings and revenue, driven primarily by the strong performance of its Azure cloud business. The company's optimistic forecast, particularly regarding Azure growth, provided reassurance to investors concerned about the potential impacts of President Trump's tariffs. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted Microsoft's plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures increasing substantially during the quarter. Despite some challenges in non-AI Azure cloud execution, Microsoft reported progress and anticipates continued demand for its AI capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court has determined that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games case, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers accusing an Apple executive of lying under oath. The judge alleges that Apple introduced new policies in 2024 that collected a 27% commission from certain purchases, a move deemed anticompetitive. The court has ordered Apple to cease imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps and to cover Epic Games' attorney fees. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the decision as a victory for developers, forcing Apple to compete with alternative payment services.</p>

          <p>New GDP data reveals that the U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The nation's gross domestic product shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, marking the worst quarterly performance since early 2022. Economists caution that the report may be skewed due to the surge in imports, but the slowdown raises concerns about the potential for a recession. Government spending cuts implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency also contributed to the economic downturn.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced the creation of a new reconstruction and investment fund, formalizing an economic agreement intended to give the United States access to proceeds from Ukraine's reserves of minerals. The agreement concludes months of negotiations and is intended to provide Ukraine with an implicit security arrangement while addressing President Trump’s concerns about U.S. aid. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the agreement signals commitment to a peace process and that no one who financed Russia's war machine will benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction. Ukraine's prime minister noted the agreement will attract resources for reconstruction, economic growth, and access to new technologies.</p>

The judge compared the situation to the Red Scare and McCarthyism, noting past instances of immigration laws being used to curb speech. The government justified the detention under the Immigration and Nationality Act, citing adverse foreign policy consequences related to antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Julia Parsons, a U.S. Navy code breaker during World War II and one of the last survivors of a top-secret team of women who deciphered German U-boat messages, has died at the age of 104. Parsons worked at the U.S. Naval Communications Annex in Washington, using the Bombe machine to decipher German military radio transmissions, which provided crucial information for Allied forces. Her work helped to shorten the war, though she also grappled with the moral implications of her role. Parsons kept her work secret for decades, even from her family, until the Enigma project was declassified in the 1970s.</p>

He argued that the trade war's impact would be worse for China, which relies on the U.S. as a market for its goods. Trump insisted that Americans do not need many of the goods imported from China and that the U.S. has been taken advantage of by other countries. The remarks came amid concerns about the potential economic fallout from the trade war, including disruptions to supply chains and higher prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>An effort to block President Trump's tariffs in the Senate fell short due to Republican opposition, with a 49 to 49 vote failing to reach the majority needed for passage. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote highlights the division in Congress over Trump's trade policies and their potential impact on the U.S. economy. The measure almost certainly wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House, making the vote largely a symbolic one.</p>
