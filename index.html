          <p>Shares of CrowdStrike declined following the release of lackluster revenue guidance for the current quarter, which fell short of analyst estimates. The cybersecurity company cited the ongoing impact of a widespread IT outage from the previous July, which temporarily disrupted flights and hospital procedures. The company ended its incentive program designed to retain customers affected by the outage, resulting in an $11 million revenue reduction in the quarter. Despite the weak guidance, CrowdStrike exceeded earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The report also projects that 10.9 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 due to changes in healthcare provisions. The bill includes $3.7 trillion in tax cuts and $1.2 trillion in spending cuts, with Republican senators expressing concerns about the deficit and Medicaid changes.

A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals came from auto-escalation features, which automatically increase savings rates over time.

Criticism includes her vote with liberal justices to reject Trump's effort to rescind a lower court order on foreign aid payments, as well as her decision to join Chief Justice John Roberts in rejecting Trump's request to delay sentencing in his New York hush money case. Some Trump allies accuse Barrett of being a "DEI Hire," while others express concern over her perceived alignment with liberal justices.

It orbits its star in just over three days, making it the smallest star known to host a gas giant. Scientists are puzzled by how such a small star could form and host such a large planet, as it challenges the core accretion theory.

          <p>Detectives are searching for clues in Portugal related to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who went missing in 2007. The search is focused on an area near Praia da Luz, where Madeleine disappeared, and involves German detectives. The prime suspect in the case is Christian BrÃ¼ckner, who is currently in jail in Germany for other offenses and has denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance. The ongoing investigation aims to uncover any new evidence that might shed light on what happened to Madeleine, though some question whether it is too late to find meaningful clues.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new leader, Lee Jae-myung, faces the challenge of balancing the country's alliance with the United States and its relationship with China. China has emphasized its importance in strengthening ties with South Korea amid global uncertainty. Lee has pledged to repair strained relations with China and North Korea, recognizing China's role as a vital trading partner. Analysts predict that Lee will pursue a more pragmatic foreign policy, but his ability to maintain a balanced approach will be tested by South Korea's position within regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Representative Stephen Lynch is seeking answers from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick regarding allegations that fired Commerce Department employees were denied health care coverage they had already paid for. The employees, who were initially terminated, briefly reinstated, and then terminated again, had their health insurance prematurely cut off, despite paying premiums through paycheck deductions. Lynch is questioning why the Commerce Department did not honor the 31-day coverage period after termination and is demanding reimbursement for premiums paid and medical bills incurred during the period of lost coverage. The Commerce Department has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>Private equity professionals at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin are expressing increased optimism about investment opportunities in Europe, reversing the negative sentiment from the previous year. Factors contributing to this shift include falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal package, and increased political stability in France, Germany, and the UK. While institutional investors have shown lackluster appetite for Europe-focused private credit funds, asset managers are expanding their presence in Europe in anticipation of new opportunities. Digital infrastructure, energy efficiency, and defense are identified as key areas with growth potential.</p>

          <p>Following recent acquisitions, Liverpool is reportedly targeting additional players to strengthen their squad, including Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez. Wirtz is seen as a key acquisition for Liverpool, and the club is willing to pay a record transfer fee for him. Kerkez, a left-back from Bournemouth, is also a target to bolster the defense. The potential arrival of Kerkez raises questions about the future of existing left-backs Andy Robertson and Konstantinos Tsimikas, with Tsimikas being the more likely candidate for departure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has brought the economic effects of tariffs back into focus. Tariffs reduce consumer surplus and increase domestic producer surplus, leading to a loss of overall economic efficiency. While tariffs may protect domestic businesses, especially in strategic industries, they also raise prices for consumers and can lead to uncertainty for businesses. The effectiveness of tariffs depends on their precise targeting and implementation, and broad-based tariffs can create economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Lee's past criticism of Japan, experts believe he will prioritize collaboration due to the current international climate. To strengthen bilateral ties, Prime Minister Ishiba should seek to build personal trust with Lee through summit talks to maintain trilateral cooperation with the United States.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for thousands of years before European colonization, caused by a different species of bacteria called Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, finding evidence of the bacteria species spread rapidly across the continent. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Europeans introduced leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae. The presence of lepromatosis in the archeological record will improve understanding of pre-colonial disease and help monitor modern cases of leprosy.</p>

          <p>A new trend of men shaving off their eyelashes is emerging as a sign of shifting male beauty standards influenced by manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces. This trend reflects a focus on hypermasculinity and a rejection of anything considered feminine, including long eyelashes. While some men claim they are doing it for themselves, the trend often intersects with misogynistic views and the denigration of women. The pursuit of these standards has led to body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring the struggles faced by young women.</p>
