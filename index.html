          <h2>France Announces Plan to Formally Recognize Palestinian Statehood in September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:32:42 EDT</div>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. The decision, revealed via a post on X, aims to advance a two-state solution and was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israel as a "reward for terror." The United States also expressed its rejection of the move, which comes amid growing international pressure for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza. The formal announcement is scheduled to occur during the UN General Assembly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty border patrol officer by an alleged undocumented immigrant, which intensified criticism from federal officials. The lawsuit claims the city's policies obstruct federal law and endanger public safety by releasing criminals onto the streets. City advocates argue the policies are crucial for community safety, allowing all residents to report crimes without fear.</p>

          <p>A rescue operation is in progress for three miners trapped underground following a collapse at the Red Chris mine in northern British Columbia, Canada. The workers, who are contractors for a drilling firm, are located in a refuge chamber with sufficient air, food, and water. However, mining company Newmont reported that a second cave-in on Wednesday severed communication with the trio. Specialized drones are being used to assess the debris-blocked area as teams work to re-establish contact and determine the safest method for extraction.</p>

          <p>Three former Justice Department officials have filed a lawsuit against Attorney General Pam Bondi, challenging their recent firings under the Trump administration. The plaintiffs, including a veteran prosecutor who handled January 6 cases, argue their terminations were arbitrary and violated federal procedures for removing civil servants. They claim they received one-page memos citing presidential authority under Article II without specific cause for their dismissal. The lawsuit seeks immediate reinstatement and back pay, highlighting a broader wave of terminations within the agency since President Trump's inauguration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe quantum friction between solid surfaces. The groundbreaking experiment, conducted using folded graphene, revealed that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness and that some thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The discovery could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear.</p>

The company is facing significant challenges, including missing the AI boom and losing market share, making the success of its foundry business critical.

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive tackle Desmond Watson, recognized as the heaviest player in the NFL, has been placed on the non-football injury list at the start of training camp due to his weight. Coach Todd Bowles stated that the 6-foot-6 rookie, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, is being held out to help him become a "healthier player." Watson, an undrafted signee from the University of Florida, is working with a team nutritionist to reach a more suitable playing weight. The team has not set a specific target weight or a timetable for his return to the field.</p>

Archbishop José Gomez stated that many hard-working people are now afraid to go to work or be seen in public. The program has already received significant donations, including a $50,000 contribution from businessman Rick Caruso.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress and pop star Renée Rapp addressed her reputation for being unfiltered and outspoken during media appearances. The 25-year-old, known for her role in the "Mean Girls" movie, explained that she finds traditional media training boring and prefers authentic conversations. While the online attention to her candid personality initially made her insecure, she has since embraced it, even referencing it in her new single "Leave Me Alone."

          <p>Four former traders convicted of rigging the Libor inter-bank lending rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, in a related case. The men were all prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office for manipulating the key interest rate for profit in a scandal that emerged after the 2008 financial crisis. The successful appeal of Hayes and Palombo, who argued they were following normal commercial practices, is expected to simplify the appeal process for the other four.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced severe flash flooding on Thursday following another day of heavy rainfall, prompting road closures and multiple water rescues. At least five people were trapped by the rushing water in a community already reeling from past floods and wildfires. Burn scars from previous fires have left the mountainsides unable to absorb the intense summer rain, making the area highly vulnerable. This event comes less than three weeks after massive flooding in the same area killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes.</p>

Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with nontraditional and ideologically diverse outlets, a shift from previous campaign strategies. This new approach appears aimed at reaching a broader electorate and addressing perceptions that the party has become too extreme. The maneuvering reflects an effort to fill a leadership vacuum and begin a course correction following the party's 2024 election loss, with candidates already shaping their messages on contentious cultural issues.</p>

Reindeer are fleeing to roads to escape insects, tourists are caught off-guard by the unseasonable warmth, and even Santa Claus is staying indoors to avoid heatstroke.

          <p>U.S. federal regulators have approved the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal that has drawn scrutiny for its political undertones. The approval by the FCC came after Paramount settled a lawsuit with Donald Trump and Skydance committed to installing a news ombudsman and ending DEI initiatives. The FCC's sole Democratic commissioner dissented, calling the deal a capitulation that erodes press freedom. The merger places iconic brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and MTV under the control of Skydance, owned by David Ellison, son of Trump ally Larry Ellison.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major tech companies are underspending, not overspending, on artificial intelligence, framing the current technological race as a "winner-take-all" situation. He pointed to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both urgent and necessary for future dominance. While acknowledging skepticism due to current chatbot inaccuracies, Cramer believes the technology will improve as companies invest in more advanced hardware. He argues the company that develops the most accurate AI will achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive spending. (not investment advice)</p>

Major brands including Kellogg's, Nestle, and Kraft Heinz have pledged to reformulate their products to eliminate artificial colors by 2026. The shift presents challenges, as natural colors can be more expensive and have a shorter shelf life than their synthetic counterparts.</p>
