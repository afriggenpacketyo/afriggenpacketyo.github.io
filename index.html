          <h2>Titanic Survivor's Letter Fetches Record Price at Auction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 00:29:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A letter penned by a Titanic passenger just days before the ship's tragic sinking has been sold for £300,000 at auction, significantly exceeding pre-sale estimates. The letter, written by Colonel Archibald Gracie, was dated April 10, 1912, the day he boarded the Titanic in Southampton. In the letter, Gracie prophetically mentioned awaiting his "journey's end" before judging the "fine ship." The anonymous buyer acquired the letter at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire, underscoring the enduring fascination with the Titanic disaster and its victims. The high price reflects the historical significance and emotional weight attached to personal accounts from that fateful voyage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers snapped a three-game losing streak with a comeback victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, fueled by timely home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Kiké Hernández. Teoscar Hernández's go-ahead homer in the eighth inning and Kiké Hernández's three-run pinch-hit blast provided the offensive spark the Dodgers needed. Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki showed improved velocity in his sixth start, while Shohei Ohtani contributed with two doubles and a triple. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the importance of swinging at good pitches, a message that seemed to resonate with several slumping Dodgers as they secured the much-needed win.</p>

          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals that President Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating in 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance. The poll highlights widespread disapproval of many of Trump's policies and significant economic discontent, including fears of a recession. A large majority believes that his economic policies are likely to cause a recession, and many are concerned about rising prices and the impact of tariffs. Despite these negative assessments, the poll also indicates that more people trust Trump over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican-led states across the U.S. are increasingly adopting school voucher programs, which use taxpayer dollars to fund private school tuition and homeschooling expenses, even amid economic uncertainty. States like Texas and Tennessee have recently approved or expanded voucher programs, raising concerns about the financial impact on public schools. Opponents worry that these programs will strain state budgets as pandemic-era federal funding diminishes, leading to competition between school choice initiatives and public education. Studies have shown that many initial voucher recipients were already attending private schools, increasing costs without necessarily expanding educational access.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruption as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States. The European Union's pharmaceutical products and chemicals represent its largest export to America, including blockbuster drugs like Ozempic and various cancer and cardiovascular treatments. These tariffs could have significant consequences for drug pricing and availability in the U.S., potentially affecting both consumers and pharmaceutical companies. The move is part of Trump's broader strategy to reshape global trade and incentivize the return of manufacturing to the United States.</p>

          <p>Australia is grappling with a shift in its approach to international students, as politicians consider capping their numbers to alleviate the country's unaffordable housing crisis. Once seen as a "super growth sector," international education is now under scrutiny, with concerns that it contributes to rental and starter home shortages. This shift represents a significant change for Australia, which has historically welcomed international students and benefited economically from their presence. While some argue for more selective criteria, the potential impact on the country's economy and reputation as a welcoming destination for international students remains a concern.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising between China and South Korea over the presence of three large steel structures in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea, with some South Korean critics likening the situation to China's island-building activities in the South China Sea. Beijing insists the structures are for commercial fish farming and comply with fisheries agreements, but South Korean lawmakers fear they are intended to bolster China's territorial claims. While China expresses willingness to resolve the dispute, some analysts warn that the issue could hinder efforts to improve bilateral relations, especially as China seeks regional support against U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported three American children, aged 2, 4, and 7, along with their Honduran-born mothers, sparking outrage from legal and civil rights organizations. The ACLU has condemned the deportations as illegal and inhumane, noting that one of the children has a rare form of metastatic cancer and was deported without necessary medication or medical consultations. Critics argue that the mothers were not given adequate opportunity to decide whether their children should remain in the United States. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to address concerns about the deportation of the 2-year-old, emphasizing the illegality of deporting a US citizen.</p>

          <p>Despite the recent market rebound, some Wall Street analysts remain skeptical, citing economic data that suggests the ongoing trade war is already causing significant damage. These analysts point to indicators such as declining shipping volumes, reduced tourism, and shrinking credit-card receipts as signs of economic strain. While many investors are relieved by signals that the White House may be easing its trade stance, some worry that the fallout from trade tensions is too entrenched to avert further economic consequences. This cautious perspective contrasts with the broader market enthusiasm, reflecting concerns that the trade war's impact may be longer-lasting than anticipated.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming election has experienced a stunning reversal of fortunes, with the Liberal party regaining ground after a period of decline. Initially trailing behind the Conservatives, the Liberals, now led by Mark Carney, have capitalized on voter anxieties surrounding President Donald Trump's trade policies and annexation rhetoric. The election has become a referendum on who can best navigate the challenges posed by the U.S., with Carney positioning himself as a steady leader in a time of uncertainty. While the Conservatives have attempted to adapt their message, the Liberals have benefited from a renewed sense of Canadian patriotism in the face of external threats.</p>
