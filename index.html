          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 people were killed. The Indian Ministry of Defence emphasized that the strikes were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and asserted Pakistan's right to respond robustly, while U.S. President Donald Trump expressed his hope for a swift end to the escalating conflict.

          <p>President Trump claimed his tariff policies spurred nearly $9 trillion in new investments in the U.S., a figure not supported by evidence. The White House cited $5 trillion in investments secured in Trump's first 100 days, but this number includes commitments from foreign countries and projects announced before his term. Trump also claimed he attracted more investment than Biden, but this comparison is misleading as it contrasts future investment pledges with a narrower list of projects completed during Biden's term.
