          <p>A second U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 11, went overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea after an arrestment failure during landing; both pilots ejected and sustained minor injuries, while no flight deck personnel were harmed. This incident occurred just over a week after another similar event on the same carrier where a Super Hornet was lost while being towed in a hangar bay. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, including nine squadrons of Carrier Air Wing 1, three guided-missile destroyers, and the USS Gettysburg, remains fully mission-capable despite these incidents.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting 1000 billion yuan ($138.6 billion) into the market. These measures also include support for key sectors like technology and real estate, along with a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care, though some analysts believe the impact on domestic credit demand may be limited.</p>

          <p>The UK government is promoting a trade deal with Delhi as a boost to living standards, particularly for the North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland, but the deal is still under scrutiny and requires extensive review. A key point of contention is the agreement allowing Indian workers transferred to the UK and their employers to avoid paying national insurance in the UK for their first three years, drawing criticism from Conservative figures who deem it 'lop-sided.' Despite the domestic political reaction, the deal is viewed within the context of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States and the European Union, with progress expected soon, and presents an opportunity for the UK to leverage post-Brexit trade tools.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff argues that President Trump's plan to weaken the dollar, based on the notion that its reserve currency status burdens the American economy, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's status does drive up demand for Treasuries, it doesn't necessarily increase demand for all US assets, and foreign countries can accumulate Treasury bills without running trade surpluses. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war, and that the strength of the American economy is a key factor behind the current account deficit, making US businesses attractive to investors.</p>

          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting 'terrorist infrastructure' in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which resulted in 26 deaths. The Indian Ministry of Defence stated that the actions were 'focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature,' with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused India of violating his country's territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed a strong response to what he termed an 'act of war imposed by India.'</p>
