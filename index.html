          <p>RTX and GE Aerospace anticipate a combined impact exceeding $1 billion due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods, highlighting the financial strain on U.S. manufacturers relying on global supply chains. RTX projects an $850 million hit this year from tariffs, including levies on China and imported steel/aluminum, while GE Aerospace plans to cut costs and raise prices to save around $500 million. GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp discussed the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump during a recent meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a reorganization of the U.S. State Department, aiming to reform it amidst criticism from the Trump White House regarding the execution of U.S. diplomacy. The reorganization will involve closing overseas missions, reducing staff, and minimizing offices dedicated to promoting liberal values. Rubio stated the current bureaucracy is more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America’s core national interests.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, but Russian strikes continued hours after his comments. While Putin expressed openness to peace initiatives, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities persisted, resulting in casualties and injuries. Zelensky reiterated the need for a clear answer from Moscow regarding a proposed cessation of attacks on civilian infrastructure. There have been no direct talks between Russia and Ukraine since the early stages of the invasion in February 2022.</p>

          <p>The education secretary has pulled student loan funding from Oxford Business College due to concerns about admissions practices. Bridget Phillipson cited issues with the "management of recruitment and attendance" and the college's failure to adequately assess students' prior attainment, including English language competence. The decision follows allegations that people are claiming millions of pounds in student loans without intending to study. Oxford Business College disputes the decision and plans to challenge it.</p>
