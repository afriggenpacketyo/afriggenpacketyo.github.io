          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit decreased by 5% year-on-year, totaling $26 billion, due to lower oil prices and reduced production, though this figure slightly exceeded analyst predictions. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion compared to the previous year. CEO Amin Nasser noted that global trade dynamics impacted energy markets, emphasizing Aramco's resilience and disciplined capital planning in volatile times. The dividend payout was also reduced from $31 billion to $21.36 billion due to cuts in its performance-linked element, signaling financial strain amidst economic uncertainty and OPEC+ production cuts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming Russia-Ukraine peace talks, stating his commitment to working with both sides to end the conflict, which he described as a 'bloodbath'. This follows a unilateral three-day ceasefire by Russia, which Ukraine claimed was violated, and Zelenskyy's subsequent offer of a 30-day ceasefire. Putin has proposed direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday, without preconditions, to which Zelenskyy responded as 'a positive sign', indicating a potential willingness from both sides to engage in negotiations to end the three-year war.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues against the notion of the 'perfect mother,' emphasizing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. She criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, highlighting that this can deter parents from seeking mental health treatment for their teenagers. Ross encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and to stop wondering if they are good enough, affirming that they already are.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, in response to calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or facing additional sanctions.

Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a mediocre start to the spring home-buying season, with sales of previously occupied homes declining in March.</p>

Experts fear a reversal of progress in combating diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, urging other countries not to follow the US in cutting funds.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about US-China trade relations following the first day of talks in Switzerland, describing them as 'friendly' and 'constructive', and indicating a 'total reset' in relations. The talks aim to ease tensions from the ongoing trade war, where the US has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods. The meetings are the first face-to-face contact between senior officials since the tariffs were implemented, with the US seeking an opening up of China to American business.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's overall energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa amounted to US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends, as China committed to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021, and is driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
