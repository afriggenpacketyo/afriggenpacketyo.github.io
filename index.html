          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and its Law Review following reports that the journal was allegedly selecting articles based on the authors' race rather than merit. These investigations, conducted by the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, stem from concerns about discriminatory practices in journal membership and article selection, potentially violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The administration's actions come amid ongoing disputes with Harvard over DEI programs and ideological screening of international students, further escalating tensions between the university and the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has experienced a significant departure of attorneys, reportedly exceeding 100, following the appointment of Harmeet Dhillon as Assistant Attorney General. Dhillon stated that the division's priorities under the Trump administration would differ from those under Biden, shifting focus from enforcing voting rights laws and policing reform to culture war issues. This shift has led to resignations as the DOJ pursues legal action against states allowing transgender athletes in women's sports and investigates alleged anti-Christian bias, sparking concerns about the politicization of the division.</p>

          <p>CBS News is facing internal turmoil as journalist Scott Pelley suggests that its parent company, Paramount, is increasing scrutiny of its content, especially regarding stories about the Trump administration. This increased supervision is allegedly linked to Paramount's desire to secure FCC approval for its merger with Skydance Media. The implication is that Paramount might be tempering CBS News' reporting to avoid potential repercussions from the administration, which has previously criticized the network's coverage and is currently engaged in an FCC inquiry into CBS' campaign coverage.</p>

          <p>The Legend of Ochi, a new film from A24, uses animatronic puppets with a mythic quality. The film is about a teenager who learns that monsters with teeth aren’t automatically bad.

          <p>A college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder, but an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, taking longer to graduate, and choosing a major with lower earning potential can reduce the return on investment. Despite these factors, the case for attending college remains strong, with the typical college graduate earning significantly more than those with only a high school diploma.</p>
