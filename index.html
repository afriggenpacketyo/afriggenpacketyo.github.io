          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously sided with an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who alleged employment discrimination based on her heterosexual orientation. Ames claimed she was denied a promotion and later demoted by the Ohio Department of Youth Services in favor of less qualified gay candidates, with her supervisor at the time also being gay. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, delivering the opinion, stated that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, but does not guarantee she will win the case against her former employer.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, a drug commonly used for medication abortions. The FDA confirmed the review, raising questions about potential impacts on access to the drug. Republican Senator Josh Hawley stated that the review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, while experts argue that concerns about its safety are misguided. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023.</p>

          <p>The autopen, a machine used to automate a person's signature, has gained attention following allegations by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons. The device uses a pen to replicate a person's signature on documents, letters, and certificates, allowing for high-volume signing without writer's cramp. While some presidents have been guarded about their use of the autopen, it has been used by many throughout U.S. history, including John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. The Justice Department has concluded that the president need not physically sign a bill for it to become law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with a Catholic charity in Wisconsin, ruling that the organization does not have to pay unemployment taxes. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state violated the First Amendment's religious freedom guarantee by requiring them to pay the tax while exempting other faith groups. Wisconsin argued that the organization's work was not religious enough to qualify for the exemption. The ruling is one of several religious-rights cases the justices are considering this term.</p>
