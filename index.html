          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the world's most powerful storm this year, has caused significant damage in southern China after making landfall in Guangdong. The typhoon brought winds up to 265km/h, leading to flooding, transport disruptions, and communication outages on several islands due to damaged undersea cables. While over a million people were evacuated in Guangdong and no casualties were reported there, the storm was responsible for at least 24 deaths across the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Restoration crews are now working to re-establish communications and power to the affected islands.</p>

          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com is initiating a share buyback program for its employees, based on a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, reflecting broader trends in the tech sector. Despite the valuation drop, the company reports strong performance, projecting over 30% core net revenue growth and $300 billion in annual e-commerce payment volume.

          <p>European Union officials are set to hold initial discussions regarding a proposal to create a comprehensive anti-drone defense system, dubbed a "drone wall." The talks, involving about 10 EU countries primarily along the eastern border, come in response to recent air incursions by Russian drones that have raised security alarms across the bloc. Ukraine, which has gained significant experience in countering Russian drone attacks, will also participate in the discussions. The proposal was recently championed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to bolster regional security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities across the world, including New York, London, and Toronto, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, creating public health concerns. Experts attribute the surge to factors like increased food waste and, notably, rising global temperatures, which allow for longer breeding seasons. A recent study found a strong correlation between temperature increases and spikes in rat activity in 11 of 16 cities examined.

          <p>A large-scale search is in progress for 44-year-old diver Bryson Higashi, who went missing in the waters near Hanalei Bay, Kauai. The U.S. Coast Guard, along with local police, fire, and natural resources departments, initiated the search after Higashi was reported missing. He was last seen on Tuesday afternoon, and his truck was later found unattended near the bay. The search operation involves boats, a helicopter, and an airplane, but is being hampered by challenging weather conditions, including strong winds and reduced visibility due to showers.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, the United States aims to reclaim the trophy from a confident European team favored to win on American soil for the first time since 2012. Key factors likely to decide the outcome include the opening day's foursomes, where the home side has historically dominated, and the ability of European players to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd. Europe boasts more collective Ryder Cup experience, but the U.S. team features the world's top player, Scottie Scheffler. The atmosphere is expected to be intense, with former President Donald Trump's planned attendance adding another dynamic.</p>

Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has participated in White House meetings on post-war plans for Gaza.

          <p>This article contrasts China's centralized, proactive five-year planning model for economic development with the United States' market-driven, reactive approach. It traces the evolution of China's planning from Soviet-style targets to a sophisticated process involving government bodies and outside experts, aimed at fostering growth and strategic goals like consumer-led rebalancing. In contrast, the U.S. relies on the "invisible hand" of the market, with fiscal and monetary policy guidance that the article argues has become ineffective due to intense political polarization. This difference highlights a fundamental divergence in economic governance between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires found that a lack of resources and outdated alert systems led to delayed evacuation warnings. The report cited critical staffing shortages in the sheriff's department and emergency management office, as well as unreliable communication systems, which hampered coordination as the Eaton and Palisades fires spread rapidly. While praising the heroic actions of first responders, the review concluded that systemic weaknesses delayed crucial public alerts. The findings highlight the need for improved policies, training, and integrated technology to better handle future emergencies.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to promote its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, for cross-border transactions by opening a new international operations center in Shanghai. The People's Bank of China aims to provide an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system. The initiative includes three platforms designed to improve the efficiency of international payments, enable blockchain-based services, and help existing financial infrastructure integrate digital assets. This move signals China's commitment to advancing the internationalization of the yuan in the digital era and reshaping global payment systems.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic finish on Thursday night. Kicker Jason Myers successfully converted a 52-yard field goal as time expired to clinch the victory. The Seahawks had initially built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but the Cardinals, led by quarterback Kyler Murray, mounted a late comeback to tie the game with just 33 seconds remaining. A penalty on the subsequent kickoff and a key pass completion set up the game-winning kick, extending Seattle's winning streak over their division rivals to eight games.</p>

          <p>The recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is being viewed as a significant escalation in President Trump's campaign to use the Justice Department against his political adversaries. The charges were filed shortly after Trump publicly called for Comey's prosecution, raising concerns about the erosion of the traditional separation between the White House and federal law enforcement. Legal experts note the move is unprecedented, suggesting a direct link between the president's demands and the actions of Attorney General Pam Bondi. This case is now at the center of a debate over the weaponization of the justice system.</p>

In a recent interview, he stated that his primary objective is ending the conflict, not securing another presidential term. Zelenskyy also confirmed that if a ceasefire were established, he would proceed with holding elections in Ukraine, which are currently suspended under martial law. His original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, but the ongoing invasion has extended his time in office beyond its initial mandate.</p>

          <p>The parents of an 8-year-old girl still missing after a deadly flood at Camp Mystic in Texas have called the camp's decision to reopen "unthinkable." The Christian summer camp, where 27 campers and counselors died in July, announced it will partially reopen in 2026. In a letter, the parents of Cile Steward criticized the camp for proceeding with reopening plans while their daughter's body has not been recovered from the Guadalupe River. Other families of victims have also expressed that the camp's priority should be the recovery effort, not resuming business.</p>

While acknowledging that parts of the market may currently be overvalued or "frothy," Ganguly believes the long-term impact of AI will be profound. He also identified India as a key market for developing AI-native applications that could become global leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge to traffic this Sunday in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge crosses the Huajiang Grand Canyon and its deck stands 625 meters above the river below, a height comparable to China's tallest skyscraper. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also poised to become the longest mountain bridge globally. This engineering feat adds to Guizhou's reputation as a hub for record-breaking infrastructure, as the province is already home to nearly half of the world's 100 tallest bridges.</p>

He will not serve jail time but was sentenced to time served under home confinement, one year of formal probation, and must register as a sex offender for at least a decade. The District Attorney expressed frustration that current state law limited the charges to misdemeanors because the assault occurred over clothing and is seeking legislative changes for harsher penalties in such cases.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of James Comey is the culmination of a long and public feud with Donald Trump that began when Trump fired the then-FBI director in 2017. The article traces the history of their conflict, from Comey's refusal to pledge loyalty to his confirmation of the Russia investigation, which ultimately led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Ironically, Comey's actions during the 2016 election, particularly his public statements about the Hillary Clinton email investigation, are widely seen as having helped Trump win the presidency. The prosecution is now viewed by many as politically motivated retribution.</p>
