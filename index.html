          <p>Israeli forces intercepted an aid boat en route to Gaza, carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists, stating the vessel was safely being directed to Israel's shores. Defense Minister Israel Katz affirmed the blockade aimed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while the Freedom Flotilla Coalition claimed the activists were "kidnapped" and their supplies confiscated. Thunberg was reported safe and in good spirits, with the aid intended for Gaza to be delivered separately. The incident follows a previous attempt by the Freedom Flotilla, which was thwarted by drone attacks, and occurs amidst ongoing tensions and debates regarding aid distribution in Gaza. Optimism about the region remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles experienced escalating protests in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement, freeway blockades, and property damage. Demonstrations were triggered by immigration enforcement operations, with federal agents arresting immigrants in various locations. Governor Newsom requested the removal of the Guard, deeming their deployment a breach of state sovereignty, while Mayor Bass criticized the move as designed to enflame tensions. The LAPD reported numerous arrests and addressed accusations of a slow response to the unrest, citing compliance with the California Values Act.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending its ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method involving dragging large nets across the seafloor, across a wider area of English waters. This proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The plan is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, and it aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed.

          <p>The value of rare earth elements exported by China in May experienced a significant drop, nearly halving compared to the previous year. Official data indicates this decline occurred as analysts suggest China's export controls on critical minerals could be a key negotiating tactic with the United States. The value of rare earth exports totaled US$18.7 million in May, a 48.3% year-on-year decrease, and a 13.7% monthly decline from April. Despite this, the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months of the year saw a slight increase of 2.3% compared to the same period last year.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, with the trial focusing on coercion. The concept of "coercive control," a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, is central to understanding the allegations, though the judge blocked expert testimony on this specific concept. The prosecution aims to demonstrate individual acts of coercion, which play a major role in the charges. Witnesses have testified to an environment of fear, paranoia, and unpredictable outbursts of temper, potentially creating a pattern of abuse and manipulation.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Travel Ban Could Solidify Racism as a Lasting Legacy</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump's latest travel ban, targeting citizens from many of the world’s poorest nations, is viewed as a continuation of his racist policies. Critics argue that the ban disproportionately affects Black, Brown, and Muslim populations, with no clear national security basis. The ban is seen as part of a broader pattern of Trump's actions, including past discrimination lawsuits, the "birther" theory, and comments about "shithole countries." The normalization of such actions raises concerns about Trump's lasting impact on US political culture.</p>

          <p>A Republican spending bill is making its way through the Senate, but it is facing a bitter divide over how to balance priorities such as extending tax cuts, bolstering immigration enforcement, and defense spending, while increasing the national debt. Some are reluctant to do so while increasing the national debt by almost $2.6 trillion and slashing Medicaid benefits. The bill would cause the US deficit to skyrocket and disproportionately benefit the rich. It also includes measures that would greatly increase the number of people without health insurance and have a big impact on immigrant populations.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts would slash NASA's science programs by nearly 50%, potentially destroying decades of research and undermining the agency's future. The cuts would disproportionately affect Earth science and astrophysics, while prioritizing commercial applications and goals endorsed by Trump, such as returning astronauts to the moon and landing a crew on Mars. Critics argue that the cuts make little sense, as they would terminate projects crucial for planning future missions and nurturing new generations of scientists.
