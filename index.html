          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his "courage, urgency and optimism" in a New York Times opinion piece. Despite past disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's commitment to safe neighborhoods, affordability, and a strong stance against Donald Trump's agenda. This endorsement from the moderate governor is significant as Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has recently apologized for past controversial remarks, signaling a strategic shift. The competitive mayoral race also features incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, with other prominent Democrats yet to declare their support.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 22:53:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump responded vaguely to questions about potential US military strikes on Venezuela, stating, "We'll see what happens," amidst rising tensions. Speaking in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump reiterated concerns about Venezuela sending "gang members, their drug dealers and drugs" into the US, citing millions of drug deaths as justification for his firm stance. These remarks follow a recent US military strike that destroyed a Venezuelan drug boat, killing suspected narco-terrorists, and accusations from Venezuela that US Navy personnel boarded one of their tuna boats. The escalating rhetoric underscores a volatile relationship, with Trump emphasizing the unacceptability of drug trafficking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a record high of 3,420.23, marking its tenth consecutive session of gains, after Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol announced the government would scrap its plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This decision provided a significant boost to investor confidence, influencing positive trading across Asia-Pacific markets despite mixed performances elsewhere. The small-cap Kosdaq also saw gains, while regional markets assessed ongoing US-China trade talks in Spain and recent Chinese economic data. The reversal of the tax-hike plan is a key factor driving this market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conservative Party has written to Sir Keir Starmer, demanding transparency regarding Downing Street's awareness of Lord Mandelson's ties to Jeffrey Epstein before his appointment as US ambassador. Tory MP Alex Burghart criticized Starmer's judgment, especially after Mandelson was sacked following revelations of supportive emails he sent after Epstein's sex offense plea. The Tories are calling for the release of all "Mandelson-Epstein Files" and for Starmer and his chief of staff to provide parliamentary evidence. This scandal, coming soon after another high-profile resignation, has intensified internal Labour Party criticism of Starmer's leadership.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown deepened in August, with retail sales and industrial output missing expectations, signaling persistent weak domestic demand and impacts from Beijing's industrial overcapacity campaign. Retail sales rose 3.4% year-on-year, a slowdown from July, while industrial output growth weakened to 5.2%, its lowest since August 2024. Fixed-asset investment expanded only 0.5%, and real estate investment contracted further by 12.9%. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged "unstable and uncertain factors" and emphasized the need for comprehensive macro policies to stabilize employment, businesses, and market expectations to foster healthy economic development.

          <p>US Democrats on a House committee have urged the Trump administration to push China to curb "structural overproduction" in any bilateral trade deal, advocating for "binding requirements." This call comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent holds talks with Chinese officials in Spain, discussing national security, economic, and trade issues. Democrats argue that China's excess manufacturing capacity, exemplified by its steel and solar panel industries, harms US jobs and international markets. This bipartisan concern underscores Washington's deep anxieties about China's economic model, despite the ongoing truce on tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Supporters argue it prevents impersonation and ensures accountability, citing concerns about officers being "confused with the guy in the ski mask robbing a liquor store."

          <p>A significant number of car owners are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle's market value, a trend reaching a four-year high. Approximately 26.6% of trade-ins toward new car purchases in Q2 2025 had negative equity, averaging $6,754, forcing consumers to roll debt into new loans or pay out of pocket. This issue is exacerbated by longer loan terms, such as increasingly common 84-month loans, and smaller down payments.

          <p>Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, is a common experience often linked to stress or busy lifestyles. While not a medical condition itself, it signifies an overstretched or tired brain, often striking after a busy period. Medical experts offer practical tips, including deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities to allow for mental reset and processing, acting as "mental buffers." Recognizing brain fog as a temporary state and giving oneself permission to slow down, delegate tasks, or seek help are crucial steps toward improving mental clarity and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting $58 million from Congress to enhance security for the executive and judicial branches, prompted by the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. These funds, directed to the U.S. Marshals Service, would also bolster protection for Supreme Court justices, as confirmed by a White House official. The administration also expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, with a new pilot program already underway for House members. Capitol Police anticipate tracking over 14,000 threats to members by year-end, leading to a "heightened posture" for security measures ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond is facing intense criticism for his handling of the football program, particularly after firing head coach DeShaun Foster just one season into his tenure. Critics argue Jarmond made poor decisions by not firing Chip Kelly earlier and then hastily hiring Foster, who lacked head coaching experience. While Jarmond has achieved success in other sports, the article asserts that football's significant financial and reputational importance demands a stronger leader. The author questions Chancellor Julio Frenk's decision to allow Jarmond to oversee the next coaching search, given his past missteps and perceived lack of accountability.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system, despite a recent 3-0 derby loss. While the team shows tactical improvements in compactness and defensive shape, individual mistakes in conceding goals are proving costly. Murphy specifically highlights Bruno Fernandes playing a deeper midfield role, where his defensive instincts are lacking, and Luke Shaw being shoe-horned into a center-back position. He contends that despite a decent start to the season, these personnel issues lead to a stack-up of errors, preventing the team from maximizing its potential and causing ongoing instability.</p>
