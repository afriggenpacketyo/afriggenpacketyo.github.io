          <p>Tensions have escalated in the South China Sea as China deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels near Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. According to the Chinese coastguard, the Philippine vessels illegally entered waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay, leading to a collision after ignoring warnings and approaching a Chinese ship. China asserts its actions were lawful and necessary for rights protection and law enforcement, urging the Philippines to cease its "infringing actions". Sandy Cay is near Subi Reef, a significant Chinese military base, and Thitu Island, the largest Philippine base in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year, translating to an annual saving of Â£129 for a typical household. This drop reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices; however, energy prices remain high, and many households are struggling with debt. Charities have expressed that this reduction offers little comfort to those burdened with significant debt to suppliers, and there are calls for more targeted government support and energy efficiency measures. The price cap does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market.</p>

No injuries were reported among the 16 people on board, and the cause of the incident is under investigation by Norwegian police.

          <p>Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, has temporarily stopped selling them in all 16 of its UK stores due to reports of customers fighting over the toys. The decision aims to prevent potential safety issues after viral trends on TikTok, fueled by celebrities like Rihanna and Dua Lipa, led to high demand and chaotic scenes in stores. The company is working on a fairer system for when the toys return, while some retail experts warn the suspension may heighten demand and encourage resellers. Fans have expressed anger at resellers who are inflating prices, making the dolls unaffordable for genuine enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>Eastern Australia is experiencing massive floods due to three days of incessant rain, resulting in inundated streets, isolated towns, and destroyed homes, with New South Wales being the worst hit. The storms have brought more than six months' worth of rain in just three days, leading to a natural disaster declaration and the deployment of resources to affected areas. The death toll has risen to four, and approximately 50,000 people remain stranded as floodwaters begin to recede.

          <p>Questions are being raised about why President Joe Biden, who has been medically scrutinized throughout his career, was not tested for prostate cancer for over a decade, especially given his recent aggressive diagnosis. While his aides claim this was in line with US regulations for men over 70, others argue that presidents receive more rigorous and personalized care. Experts suggest that regular testing should continue for men in high public office, regardless of age, especially with newer, more accurate tests available. Concerns are mounting over potential cognitive decline as a side effect of hormone treatments for advanced prostate cancer.</p>

The decision comes as the penny's production cost exceeds its value, costing nearly four cents to mint each coin. The US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs once the penny is phased out.

          <p>A decision by the Trump administration to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students could significantly impact the university's sports teams, potentially wiping out several rosters. With 21% of Harvard's athletes being international, teams like men's heavyweight crew, men's hockey, and men's squash would be severely affected. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to alleged antisemitism as the reason for the visa revocation, potentially forcing thousands of foreign students to leave the country. Harvard is challenging the action, calling it unlawful and vowing to fight hate.</p>

The growth in Chinese carmakers' BEV sales has been substantial, jumping 59% year-on-year in April, despite EU tariffs.

It creates a climate where what was fast becoming unsayable in polite company can, once again, be said with confidence.

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office was marked by controversy, as Trump used the occasion to focus on unsubstantiated claims of white South Africans facing genocide. Trump's actions overshadowed discussions on critical issues such as trade and South Africa's genocide case against Israel. Despite Ramaphosa's attempts to steer the conversation towards bilateral trade and South Africa's upcoming hosting of the G20, Trump persisted in promoting false narratives. The meeting has been criticized as a missed opportunity for meaningful dialogue and a demonstration of Trump's penchant for political theater over diplomacy.</p>
