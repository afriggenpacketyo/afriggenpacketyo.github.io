Trump also announced an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, emphasizing the critical need to "stop the killing, and make a DEAL!"

          <p>Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was executed by lethal injection in Arizona for the 1993 murders of Albert Luna Sr., Patricia Luna, their daughter Rochelle, and son Damien. Djerf, who had been imprisoned for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency, with the state's Attorney General emphasizing that the victims deserved justice and their loved ones deserved closure. The execution, Arizona's second this year, proceeded despite past criticisms regarding the state's lethal injection protocols and a prior eight-year hiatus due to concerns over botched procedures. Djerf had previously acknowledged his actions and apologized for the pain he caused.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former New York Representative George Santos's federal prison sentence, which he had begun serving for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos, who was less than three months into his 87-month sentence, had publicly appealed to the Trump administration, citing political motivation and alleged mistreatment during his incarceration. This act of clemency follows Santos's conviction for extensive fabrications and fraudulent schemes that led to his expulsion from Congress in 2023, a move unprecedented in modern history. The commutation, framed by Trump as a response to Santos's "Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!", marks another high-profile pardon by Trump for former Republican politicians.</p>

          <p>The US-China trade war continues to be marked by escalating "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and unpredictable high-level meetings, leading to significant tariff swings. Analysts attribute this chaotic dynamic to a mutual disregard for traditional diplomatic norms and a fundamental lack of clear communication, causing both sides to misinterpret the other's actions and intentions. Recent escalations include Beijing's expanded export controls on strategic rare earth minerals, triggered by Washington's increased sanctions on blacklisted firms. This article highlights the ongoing, volatile nature of the bilateral economic relationship, suggesting a difficult path to resolution.</p>

          <p>Former US attorney Alexander Acosta testified before the House oversight committee, defending his controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein by stating a federal trial would have been a "crapshoot." A transcript reveals Acosta cited victims' lack of cooperation and inconsistent accounts as evidentiary hurdles, explaining his office's decision to hand the case to state prosecutors to ensure Epstein served jail time and registered as a sex offender. He denied consulting Donald Trump about the agreement and expressed frustration with Epstein's defense team's aggressive tactics. This testimony provides critical context to the non-prosecution agreement, which has generated ongoing controversy and conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking to reinstate the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The administration argues these troops are essential to protect US immigration agents from hostile protesters and to enforce federal laws, claiming a "danger of rebellion" exists. However, lower court judges in Chicago had previously disagreed, finding no such rebellion and accusing Trump's lawyers of exaggerating the extent of violence. This article details the escalating legal and political conflict between the Trump administration and Democratic state officials over immigration enforcement and the federal use of military-style force in American cities.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer to a misdemeanor against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California. Huerta was arrested for obstructing ICE agents during an immigration raid, but his attorneys contend he was exercising his First Amendment rights and is being unfairly targeted for his vocal criticism of the administration's immigration policies. The incident, which involved Huerta being physically restrained and pepper-sprayed, prompted widespread protests and calls for an official review from California Democratic Senators.

          <p>A new study presents "exciting results" for the Galleri blood test, a breakthrough diagnostic tool capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, many of which currently lack any screening programs. Developed by Grail, the test accurately identified cancer in 62% of positive cases and correctly ruled it out in over 99% of negative results during a year-long North American trial involving 25,000 adults. Crucially, more than half of the detected cancers were found at an early stage, when they are significantly easier to treat and potentially curable. While impressive, scientists emphasize that further research is needed, particularly from a large NHS trial next year, to confirm if the test ultimately reduces cancer deaths.</p>

Buckingham Palace, reportedly exasperated by the "constant parade of headlines," facilitated this move to preempt parliamentary intervention and safeguard the monarchy's reputation. The immediate catalyst was a recently published email contradicting Andrew's claims about severing ties with Epstein, combined with excerpts from Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailing alleged sexual assault.

It proposes a fundamental shift in development priorities from property-led growth to one that champions innovation and cultural content creation.

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing an ambitious architectural legacy, overseeing the construction of a $250 million White House ballroom and proposing a grand arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial. The ballroom, entirely financed by private donors including prominent tech executives, is reportedly fully funded, with surplus money potentially allocated to the arch project. Democrats, however, are strongly opposing these initiatives, with one representative introducing legislation to regulate donor recognition on White House structures and prohibit construction during government shutdowns. They argue these projects distract from critical national issues, though Trump views them as a welcome diversion from geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, calling the idea "interesting." Kirill Dmitriev, a Russian investment envoy, suggested the estimated $65 billion project could be significantly reduced to $8 billion and completed within eight years using Boring Company technology. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, however, voiced his disapproval of the concept. This article highlights a highly speculative and politically charged infrastructure project, complicated by geopolitical tensions, the extreme conditions of the region, and Musk's company's past regulatory issues.</p>

          <p>CBS News has ceased its physical presence at the Pentagon, ending over 60 years of continuous coverage, after refusing to sign new press requirements. The Pentagon's controversial policy mandates formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, a move press associations argue infringes on First Amendment rights and aims to control information flow. Longtime CBS correspondents, like David Martin, lament the loss of in-person access, emphasizing its crucial role in building trust and breaking stories through direct engagement. Despite losing building credentials, CBS News affirms its commitment to robustly covering the military and national security for the American public.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has formally announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, stating that the persistent accusations against him distract from the work of the Royal Family. This significant decision comes immediately after the public release of excerpts from Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, which details her alleged sexual assault by Andrew when she was 17, facilitated by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has consistently denied these allegations, having settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022. The relinquishment represents a further, decisive step back from public life following years of intense scrutiny and scandal linked to Epstein.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has offered "everything" in natural resources to de-escalate US tensions, emphasizing the US's dominant position. This statement coincided with the confirmation of a sixth US military strike on a suspected "drug-carrying submarine" off Venezuela, resulting in two survivors now in US custody. Trump justified these aggressive actions, including covert CIA operations and a significant military buildup, as combating drug cartels. However, legal scholars and human rights experts are raising serious concerns that these strikes may violate international law and constitute extrajudicial executions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through White House budget director Russell Vought, announced a freeze on $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects in predominantly Democratic states. This punitive measure, which targets "low priority" Army Corps of Engineers work in major cities like New York, San Francisco, and Boston, could ultimately lead to project cancellations. The action is framed as part of President Trump's broader strategy to exert pressure on congressional opponents amidst an ongoing government shutdown and to "reorient" federal spending priorities. All affected states had voted against Trump in the 2024 presidential election, and many are designated "sanctuary jurisdictions." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jack in the Box is selling its entire stake in its subsidiary, Del Taco, to Yadav Enterprises for $115 million in cash, a transaction expected to close in January 2026. This strategic divestiture is a key component of Jack in the Box’s "Jack on Track" revamp, designed to strengthen its balance sheet and refocus on its core burger brand. Del Taco, which Jack in the Box acquired in 2022 for a significantly higher sum, has recently faced operational struggles, including temporary closures of numerous locations. Yadav Enterprises, an existing Jack in the Box franchisee, will acquire over 550 Del Taco restaurants, aiming for a new chapter of evolution for the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Instagram is implementing a new default PG-13 content setting for all users under the age of 18, aiming to foster a safer, more age-appropriate online experience. This significant update expands existing restrictions on graphic, violent, or sexually suggestive content, as well as posts promoting risky stunts or strong language, by hiding them from teens' recommendations. While intended to address pervasive parental concerns, content moderation experts question the "anachronistic" PG-13 label's efficacy for dynamic social media, fearing it may inadvertently stifle creative expression and context-sensitive conversations. The move reflects Meta's heightened focus on teen safety, even if it risks over-filtering.</p>
