          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) introduced a significant software update featuring a new design language called Liquid Glass, impacting iPhones, Macs, and Vision Pro headsets. This marks the first major iPhone operating system redesign since 2013, with changes to the lock screen and button animations. However, the unveiling failed to impress Wall Street, with investors expressing concerns over Apple's artificial intelligence strategy compared to competitors like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, citing the need for more development time to meet quality standards, restating its timeline for the coming year.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations. The demonstrations, initially peaceful, escalated into violence, with vehicles set ablaze and a major highway temporarily shut down. President Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines to the city, leading to clashes and numerous arrests. California's governor and the LA mayor have condemned the deployment, arguing local police can manage the situation, with the governor initiating legal action, asserting the President is overstepping federal authority.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is laying off 3.5% of its workforce, citing economic challenges and declines in linear television viewership.

The company had previously reduced its workforce by 15% last year as part of a cost-cutting initiative. Paramount and Skydance are currently awaiting regulatory approval for their merger amidst a lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS over a "60 Minutes" program, which the network defends as completely without merit. </p>

Newsom described the move as a "deranged fantasy" and is suing the president for deploying troops without state approval. The protests, which began after ICE raids in Latino areas, have resulted in looting, vehicle fires, and clashes with law enforcement. The LAPD has made numerous arrests, and similar protests have spread to other US cities, reflecting broader tensions over immigration policies.</p>

The proposed law would deposit $1,000 into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund account for each newborn, with potential for up to $5,000 in annual contributions. These accounts would be designed to help children cover future expenses like college or a down payment on a home.

          <p>As Republicans consider cuts to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), a new poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans. The House of Representatives passed a bill that could cut billions from health programs, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Many Republicans may be affected by these cuts, as they are more likely to be self-employed and live in states that did not expand Medicaid. These factors make them more reliant on ACA marketplace subsidies for health insurance.</p>

Online banks typically offer the most competitive CD rates, allowing savers to maximize their earnings.
