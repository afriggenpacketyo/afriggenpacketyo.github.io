        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DW report examines the potential trend of rising retirement ages in Europe, exemplified by Denmark's recent legislation to raise the retirement age to 70 for those born after 1970. The article explores how demographic changes, such as aging populations and shrinking workforces, are straining pension systems across the continent. It contrasts the Bismarck and Beveridge models of pension financing and discusses the economic and social implications of both longer working lives and earlier retirement. Germany is considering similar reforms, highlighting the broader challenges European nations face in balancing pension sustainability with individual well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a Vox editorial, the United States is endangering two critical advantages: the dollar's global dominance and the excellence of its elite universities. The author argues that the Trump administration's policies, including tariffs and budget deficits, are eroding the dollar's "exorbitant privilege," which has allowed the US to live beyond its means. Similarly, actions like cutting federal funding for universities and restricting international students threaten America's scientific supremacy, historically fueled by attracting global talent to institutions like Harvard and MIT. The article asserts that losing these privileges would force the US to confront its fiscal and educational shortcomings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. The judge, Richard Leon, emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating the order suppressed disfavored speech by imposing severe sanctions on the firm. WilmerHale previously employed former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. This is the third time a judge has struck down one of Trump's executive orders targeting law firms associated with his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a team from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can access a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas granted permission after the Trump administration demonstrated a system to train employees to prevent improper disclosures.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, contributing significantly to the rise in the national unemployment rate. The report attributes this trend to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech sector. Economic uncertainty, driven by tariff policies, is also slowing hiring. The article notes that underemployment, where college-educated workers take jobs that don't require a degree, is a growing concern.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency has been marked by unprecedented corruption, exceeding any previous administration in American history. The author asserts that Trump has used his office to gain improper wealth through various means, including foreign government dealings and exploiting his position for personal gain. The article contrasts Trump's actions with past presidential scandals, such as Watergate, and argues that the scale and brazenness of Trump's self-enrichment are unparalleled. The author argues Trump and his supporters defame others to dull voters’ awareness of the astounding and horrible uniqueness of Trump’s corruption.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined £122.7 million by Ofwat, the water industry regulator, for breaching rules regarding sewage spills and shareholder payouts. This is the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, which stated that Thames Water had failed to protect the environment and had let down its customers. The fine will be paid by the company and its investors, not by customers. Ofwat also fined Thames an additional £18.2m for breaches relating to shareholder payouts, saying the payouts were “undeserved” and did “not properly reflect the company's delivery performance”.</p>

          <p>The New York Times discusses the potential for the U.S. government to demand "golden shares" in foreign-owned companies, giving it veto power over certain corporate functions and board appointments. This concept is being considered in the context of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel and could potentially be applied to other strategic sectors, such as manufacturing, technology, or defense. The article explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of such an approach, including the risk of retaliation from other countries and the possibility of politically driven interference in corporate governance.</p>
