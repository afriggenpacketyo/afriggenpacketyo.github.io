          <p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury concerning the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia collusion allegations. This action follows the declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited a memo suggesting a plan by Hillary Clinton's campaign to link Donald Trump to Russia. The proceedings will explore whether political opponents conspired to generate false accusations, though it remains unclear what specific charges could be filed or who might be targeted. This legal step renews the contentious debate over the legitimacy of the initial FBI probe into the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices announced second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations on profit, although its revenue surpassed estimates. The chipmaker's stock declined in after-hours trading following the report, which detailed overall sales growth of 32% year-over-year. AMD, a key competitor to Nvidia, is seeing increased interest in its AI chips but faces challenges from U.S. export controls on technology sent to China. The company's data center and client/gaming segments both showed significant annual revenue growth, driven by server CPUs and strong demand for its latest desktop processors.

          <p>Snap's stock value dropped by 15% after the company reported that its global average revenue per user for the second quarter missed Wall Street expectations. While the company's daily active users exceeded forecasts, the weaker ARPU metric raised concerns, especially as peers like Reddit have shown strength in this area. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker growth to a flawed advertising platform update and macroeconomic factors. Despite a 9% year-over-year sales increase, the company recorded a net loss of $262.6 million, wider than the previous year's loss for the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

For the current quarter, Super Micro projected adjusted earnings and revenue below consensus estimates, signaling ongoing challenges. However, the company offered a more optimistic outlook for the full 2026 fiscal year, forecasting revenue that exceeds current Wall Street predictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are arguing against the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case, stating that she is still alive and has viable legal options, including a pending appeal to the Supreme Court. They contend that releasing the testimony, which they have not been allowed to review, would be prejudicial. The DOJ has revealed that the grand jury only heard from two law enforcement officers, not any alleged victims directly. Meanwhile, some of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers are supporting the release to shed light on the full scope of the abuse network.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, faulting owner OceanGate for using "intimidation tactics" to bypass regulatory oversight. The report states the vessel's design was fundamentally flawed and that the company operated with a "toxic" safety culture, ignoring prior damage that likely compromised the hull's integrity. Investigators asserted that OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, exhibited overconfidence and negligence that contributed to the deaths of all five people aboard. The company has since ceased operations and cooperated with the inquiry.</p>

Trump has proposed a "most favored nations" pricing model, aiming to align U.S. drug costs with the lowest prices paid in other developed countries.

Currently, a top-rate high-yield savings account would narrowly earn more interest over three months than a top-rate 3-month CD. However, the CD rate is fixed, providing certainty, while the savings account rate is variable and could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected.

          <p>More than 2,300 members of the Writers Guild of America, including prominent figures like Spike Lee and Adam McKay, have signed an open letter condemning what they describe as an "unprecedented, authoritarian assault" on free speech by the Trump administration. The letter cites actions such as filing lawsuits against news organizations, threatening broadcasters' licenses, and defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The writers call these moves un-American attempts to silence criticism and control narratives. They urge elected officials and industry leaders to resist this overreach and defend democratic principles.</p>

          <h2>Texas Redistricting Battle Highlights National Stakes for Control of Congress</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The political standoff in Texas over redrawing electoral maps has national implications that could determine the balance of power in the U.S. Congress. Republicans are pushing a plan to create up to five new GOP-leaning districts, which could protect or expand their narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This has prompted Texas Democrats to flee the state to block the vote and has led Democratic governors in states like California and New York to threaten their own partisan redistricting in response. The conflict underscores how state-level legislative fights can have profound consequences for national politics.</p>

          <p>A recent opinion column argues that Kamala Harris may not be the right candidate to lead the Democratic Party in the future, despite speculation she may run for president again. The author points to historical data showing that presidential candidates who lose their first attempt rarely win the next election. The article contends that the Democratic Party is currently highly unpopular, even among its own base, for failing to effectively oppose the Trump administration. Harris, as the face of the 2024 loss, symbolizes this discontent and may struggle to expand the party's coalition.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase fell on Tuesday after the company announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. The stock is now down over 30% from its record high in July, when legislative momentum for crypto regulation boosted its value. Although analysts have recently raised price targets citing long-term potential from new laws and stronger bitcoin prices, the stock's momentum has waned. The recent decline comes as investors adopt a more risk-averse stance and follows a disappointing second-quarter revenue report from the company last week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for a large sum like $100,000 are advised to ask critical questions first. A key consideration is the impact of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, as HELOCs have variable rates that would decrease, lowering payments over time. However, homeowners should also question how significant these cuts will be and whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a better option for stability. The article stresses that borrowing against home equity should always be done cautiously due to the risk of foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to a $500,000 settlement with two journalists from Knock LA who were arrested while covering a 2021 protest at Echo Park. The reporters claimed their constitutional rights were violated when police detained them after declaring an unlawful assembly, despite state law protecting journalists' right to report. This settlement averts a federal trial but comes amid ongoing criticism of the LAPD's treatment of the press.

          <p>A new spending package signed by President Donald Trump will introduce changes that reduce the tax deduction for charitable donations for high-income earners, starting in 2026. The legislation establishes a floor, allowing the deduction only on donations exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and also caps the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners suggest that wealthy individuals may want to consider strategies like "bunching" multiple years of donations into 2025 to maximize the more generous deduction while it is still available. The bill also adds a new, limited deduction for non-itemizers. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists warn that the reef's future is volatile, as it may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events.
