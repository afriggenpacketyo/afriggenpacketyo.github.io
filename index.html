          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, resulted in one fatality and injuries to four others, with the blast field extending several blocks and causing significant damage to nearby buildings. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, confirmed that its staff was unharmed and the IVF lab remained intact, ensuring the safety of stored embryos. The FBI is collaborating with local authorities and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate the incident, which is considered one of the largest bombing investigations in Southern California. Authorities are working to determine whether the act was domestic or international terrorism.</p>

          <p>The luxury jewelry market is experiencing continued growth, driven by wealthy shoppers who are increasingly selective and focused on acquiring pieces from top-tier brands. Swiss luxury group Richemont, which owns sought-after brands such as Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier, is particularly benefiting from this trend. Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with its Jewellery Maisons division leading the way with 11% growth, the strongest segment growing 8%. This trend indicates that while broader luxury spending may be slowing, the demand for high-end jewelry remains robust among affluent consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, a first for Chicago. The sudden shift in conditions created hazardous conditions on major highways, including Interstates 55 and 57 in Illinois. The dust storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil from parched farmland, with soil moisture levels exceptionally low. The Weather Service had previously issued a similar warning in 2023, which resulted in a deadly crash, and the recent event harkens back to dust storms from the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.</p>

          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries among the 277 people on board. The ship, en route to Iceland, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge, causing its mast to strike the structure, however the bridge inspectors found no structural damage. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the injured were transported to local hospitals, while the ship was later docked at Pier 36. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct a full investigation into the crash, which briefly closed the Brooklyn Bridge to traffic.</p>

          <p>Recent military clashes between India and Pakistan have highlighted the ongoing challenges India faces in managing its relationship with its neighbor, despite India's aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power. The conflict, triggered by a terrorist attack, resulted in military exchanges with limited strategic gains but served as a reminder of the persistent instability in the region. This situation is further complicated by the involvement of global powers, with the United States supporting India and China backing Pakistan, as well as the rise of religious nationalism in both countries. India's strategic focus is increasingly directed towards China, but the enduring conflict with Pakistan remains a significant distraction and constraint.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from a bone spur, but struggled in the first inning, giving up three runs. Although he settled down, the Angels ultimately won the game 11-9, highlighted by Logan O'Hoppe's five RBIs. Kershaw's return is crucial for the Dodgers, who are missing several starters due to injury, and his presence is expected to boost the team's intensity. Despite his personal struggles, Freddie Freeman had four hits, continuing his strong performance in May, but the Dodgers could not overcome the Angels' offensive surge.</p>

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws regarding the use of artists' content for AI development, labeling the move as "theft" and expressing a sense of betrayal. Speaking to the BBC, John argued that these plans would disproportionately harm young artists lacking the resources to fight large tech companies. He also warned that the government's actions would rob young people of their legacy and income. The government defends its position by stating that it is consulting on measures to balance the interests of both creative industries and AI companies.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall's article discusses the challenges in holding despots like Vladimir Putin accountable under international law, despite the establishment of a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine. The author argues that the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states, including the US, undermines the system. The article also highlights the ineffectiveness of the UN Security Council and the International Court of Justice, and suggests that democratic states often fail to uphold international law, citing the 2003 invasion of Iraq as an example. The piece concludes that the struggle to uphold international law reflects a moral confusion among political leaders and a lack of respect for the rules necessary for peaceful coexistence.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel's guest essay discusses how the Trump family's profiting from the presidency, through foreign deals and access peddling, is a continuation of a long-standing trend of American politicians engaging in corruption. The author points out that both Republican and Democratic administrations have overlooked such behavior, citing Hunter Biden's foreign lobbying and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of funds from autocratic regimes. The essay also criticizes Trump's dismantling of counter-kleptocracy measures, but notes that these can be reinstated by future administrations, and calls for Congress to pass legislation preventing former politicians from becoming foreign lobbyists and targeting family members' foreign deals.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay contrasts the revitalized night train network in Europe with the struggling long-distance public transport in the United States. While Europe invests in high-speed rail and promotes environmentally friendly travel, America continues to prioritize cars and unproven transportation projects. The author argues that America's car dependence has led to decreased happiness and mental health among drivers, and that investing in rail networks and subway systems would offer a better alternative. He also criticizes Elon Musk's Hyperloop project for diverting investment from tried-and-tested transit systems, and suggests that America should rediscover the community, connection, and shared purpose that trains offer.</p>

An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office suggests that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance. While some Republicans claim the cuts aim to eliminate fraud and waste without affecting coverage, many Medicaid recipients worry about reduced access to care and difficult choices between healthcare and basic needs.

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts in the Middle East have signaled a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking a backseat to negotiations with other regional players. Trump's meetings with Syrian and Gulf leaders, coupled with agreements on Iran and Yemen, have occurred without significant involvement from Israel. This shift reflects a potential change in priorities, with the U.S. focusing on broader regional deals and economic opportunities, even as concerns persist about the implications for Israel's security and influence.</p>

          <p>Despite growing public regret over Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to mend ties with the European Union face strong opposition from the British news media. Tabloids are using phrases like "surrender summit" and launching campaigns to "betray Brexit," reflecting a continued divide over the UK's relationship with Europe. While President Trump's foreign policy might incentivize greater cooperation with the EU, the political landscape remains challenging for Starmer, who must navigate a hostile media environment and lingering divisions from the Brexit debate. This complicates his efforts to pursue closer ties with the EU while addressing domestic concerns.</p>

For example, tickets for comedian Jimmy O. Yang's shows in Hong Kong sold out quickly, prompting many to purchase travel bundles.

Critics suggest that the song's manic and inconsistent style, a "mish-mash of musical styles," was the primary reason for its failure to connect with a wider audience. The staging, though energetic, lacked the scale and drama of other entries, but the article suggests that the UK shouldn't be too down on the band themselves. Positive comments from other artists such as Conchita Wurst, show how strong the band's overall performance was.</p>
