          <p>Despite its stock price increasing over 160% this year, financial services company Robinhood is confronting several significant challenges that could impede its growth. The company faces a formal investigation in Florida regarding allegedly deceptive crypto trading cost claims and industry-wide cost pressures from potential new data access fees by major banks. Additionally, Robinhood is navigating customer opposition to new crypto staking fees and scrutiny from European regulators and OpenAI over its tokenized stock offerings. These obstacles present a complex landscape for the popular trading platform as it continues to expand its services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Gergen, a highly respected political commentator and advisor who served in the White House for four U.S. presidents from both parties, has passed away at the age of 83.

Following his extensive career in public service, he became a familiar face in political analysis for outlets like CNN and PBS and taught at Harvard University.</p>

          <p>Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun has announced his intention to purchase another $100 million of the $TRUMP memecoin, effectively doubling his investment in the digital asset tied to President Donald Trump. Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain, is positioning the token as a key currency for the MAGA movement and plans to make it tradable on his network. This move comes as political memecoins face scrutiny, with the Trump-affiliated token having experienced significant price volatility since its launch. The token's design funnels a fee from every transaction to its creators, generating substantial revenue amid the speculative trading frenzy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has burned approximately 8,700 acres in Arizona, prompting the immediate evacuation of visitors and staff from the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim. The blaze, which was started by lightning and remains 0% contained, is being fueled by extreme heat, high winds, and dry conditions. In a separate incident, a 67-year-old hiker died in the park from what appears to be heat-related causes. The wildfire threat extends to other states, with parks in Colorado also facing evacuations due to lightning-ignited fires across the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by conducting advanced integration tests between crewed fighter jets and semi-autonomous drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing the effectiveness of this "loyal wingman" concept in a training environment. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to maintain air supremacy, particularly in its technological race with China. The tests focus on real-time coordination and aim to leverage uncrewed platforms to augment the capabilities of traditional fighter aircraft in complex combat scenarios.</p>

Lula stated that Brazil would invoke its reciprocity law if negotiations fail, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two nations. The situation is complex, as Trump is using trade policy to influence another country's domestic judicial proceedings, a move that has united political factions within Brazil against the U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>Millions of people in the United Kingdom are facing hosepipe bans as the country experiences its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching 34.7C (94.5F). Water companies have imposed restrictions on activities like watering gardens and washing cars due to record-level demand for drinking water amid the prolonged dry, hot weather. Health authorities have issued amber heat alerts for much of England, warning of risks to the entire population, not just the vulnerable. Meanwhile, fire services in Scotland and Northern Ireland have issued extreme wildfire warnings, urging the public to be cautious.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan under the Trump administration. The cuts, which include both civil service and foreign service staff, are part of a larger plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by 15% and consolidate numerous offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the indiscriminate cuts undermine national security and diplomatic readiness. The reorganization also involves integrating the former functions of USAID into the State Department, a move that has drawn significant backlash from humanitarian groups.</p>

The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, focusing on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content.

Data shows a 15% decline in listings for traditional entry-level corporate roles, while applications per job have surged, and unemployment for young degree holders is unusually high. Experts suggest that AI is beginning to automate the rote, repetitive tasks often assigned to new hires, thus redefining the nature of entry-level work. This shift is increasing pressure on graduates to acquire AI-related skills and may be contributing to a deterioration in job opportunities for the least experienced workers.</p>
