          <h2>Trump Administration Expands Immigration Enforcement Through Local Partnerships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its efforts to deport individuals by collaborating with local law enforcement agencies. A recent six-day operation in Florida led to over 1,100 arrests, with ICE working alongside state agencies like the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. This strategy, according to ICE officials, serves as a model for nationwide implementation, effectively multiplying their enforcement capabilities. While proponents argue this frees up ICE officers for other tasks, critics, including the ACLU, raise concerns about civil rights violations and financial burdens on localities, citing past issues with similar programs. This article provides insights into the administration's evolving approach to immigration enforcement and the controversies surrounding it.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Marie Ange Blaise, a Haitian woman who died in an ICE detention center in Florida after complaining of chest pain, lawmakers are demanding a thorough investigation. Blaise was detained after attempting to board a flight to North Carolina from the U.S. Virgin Islands and was subsequently transferred between multiple facilities before her death. Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick suggests Blaise was not provided adequate medical care. The death comes amid increased scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration policies, with concerns raised about mistreatment and oversight in detention centers, and this article highlights the growing concerns surrounding the treatment of immigrants in ICE custody.</p>

          <p>McDonald's reported a significant decline in U.S. same-store sales, marking the worst domestic performance since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, with a 3.6% drop.

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's first 100 days in his second term have damaged American democracy more than any period since Reconstruction. The board asserts that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unbound by Congress or the courts, undermining constitutional checks and balances. The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's autocratic tendencies while acknowledging his legitimate election and legal actions. It highlights specific areas of concern, including attacks on the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government accountability, and this article presents a critical analysis of the current administration's impact on democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, refusing to return the funds. This practice emerged as part of Governor Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star, which increased policing along the border. While county officials claim they are deterring illegal crossings and compensating landowners, critics argue that deporting migrants before their court dates effectively deprives them of due process and unjustly enriches the county. This article explores the financial incentives driving aggressive border enforcement and the legal and ethical questions surrounding the forfeiture of migrants' bail money.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is scrutinizing the $2.5 billion Federal Reserve building renovation, calling the price tag "high" and questioning what taxpayers are getting for the money. The project, which began in 2021 with an initial cost of $1.9 billion, has seen costs rise due to materials, construction delays, and design changes. Musk, who is exiting his role with DOGE, believes the cost overruns should be part of the broader examination of government waste, and this article highlights Musk's concerns about government spending and the Fed's renovation project.</p>

Eighty-four senior faculty members have pledged to donate 10% of their salary this year, totaling an estimated $2.5 million. The Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding and signaled its intention to suspend another $1 billion in grants, citing alleged antisemitic incidents on campus, and this article reports on the faculty's response and Harvard's lawsuit against the administration.</p>

          <p>Ukraine signed a deal giving the United States control over a share of its future revenue from natural resources, a long-awaited agreement that Kyiv hopes will clear the way for continued U.S. support. The announcement late on Wednesday that the deal had been signed came after months of fraught negotiations â€” including an explosive Oval Office confrontation â€” as the Trump administration tries to broker an end to Ukraineâ€™s three-year war with Russia. The agreement, which involves creating a joint investment fund between the countries, is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in the countryâ€™s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russiaâ€™s invasion. It could also clear the way for more consequential talks on U.S. military backing for Ukraine and on the terms of a possible truce with Russia.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors highlight a lesser-known 401(k) feature that can significantly boost retirement savings: after-tax 401(k) contributions. Some plans allow contributions beyond the standard $23,500 limit, which can then be converted to Roth for tax-free growth. While only a minority of plans offer this feature, and participation remains low, it can be an effective strategy for maximizing retirement savings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Decades of wellness studies have identified a formula for happiness, but you wonâ€™t figure it out alone. Research has shown that strong, long-term relationships with spouses, family and friends built on deep trust â€” not achievement, not fortune or fame â€” were what predicted well-being. Also, even fleeting social interactions could improve happiness. Talking to strangers â€” on trains, in a coffee shop, at the playground, on line at the D.M.V., in the waiting room at the doctorâ€™s office â€” could be dismissed as an exercise that simply makes the time pass. But it could also be seen as a moving reflection of how eager we all are, every day, to connect with other humans whose interiority would otherwise be a mystery, individuals in whose faces we might otherwise read threat, judgment, boredom or diffidence. Talking to strangers guarantees novelty, possibly even learning. It holds the promise, each time, of unexpected insight.</p>
