          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The protest was organized to challenge the ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense. Many demonstrators simultaneously revealed signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," leading to one of the largest single-day mass arrests by the force in a decade. While the government defended the ban based on security advice, civil liberties groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a disproportionate and concerning threat to freedom of expression.</p>

The lawmakers left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly increase GOP congressional seats. The lawsuit, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, accused the PAC of bribery and deceptive fundraising. O'Rourke has responded with a countersuit, accusing Paxton of attempting to silence dissent and suppress voter registration efforts, vowing to continue fighting the redistricting efforts.

          <p>A Texas real estate magnate and big-game hunter, Asher Watkins, was killed during a hunting expedition in South Africa after being attacked by the Cape buffalo he was stalking. The safari company described the incident as a "sudden and unprovoked attack" by the animal. Cape buffalo are known to be extremely dangerous and are a sought-after trophy for hunters. The nature of Watkins' death has sparked widespread discussion online, with animal rights organizations like PETA using the incident to highlight their opposition to trophy hunting, calling for an end to the practice.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after just two months in office reportedly stemmed from a clash with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. According to reports, the Department of Homeland Security requested the IRS cross-check a list of names, but the agency declined to share specific taxpayer information, citing privacy laws. This resistance appears to have conflicted with the administration's goal of using the IRS to aid in its immigration crackdown. The White House has denied any discord, while Long has since announced he will become the U.S. ambassador to Iceland.</p>

          <p>While many people are aware of foods that benefit brain health, neurologists are cautioning against some lesser-known items that can harbor dangerous pathogens and neurotoxins. According to medical experts, consumers should avoid food from damaged or bulging cans due to the risk of botulism, a potent toxin that can cause paralysis. They also advise limiting the consumption of large tropical reef fish like barracuda and grouper, which can accumulate ciguatoxin, leading to neurological symptoms. Finally, undercooked pork, especially from unregulated sources, poses a risk of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection that is a leading cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide.</p>

The nomination continues the administration's process of filling key diplomatic positions in its second term. Bruce has been serving as the State Department's spokesperson since the beginning of the term, and it is currently unclear who will replace her in that position.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, Jonny Bairstow's sensational unbeaten 86 runs from 50 balls was not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire, who lost to London Spirit by a narrow eight-run margin. Despite Bairstow's late-game heroics, Fire's chase of 164 was hampered by an early top-order collapse. In another match, the Oval Invincibles maintained their perfect start to the tournament with a dominant nine-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals. Will Jacks and Tawanda Muyeye led the charge for the Invincibles with a blistering 114-run partnership, securing the win with 43 balls to spare.</p>

          <p>This article addresses and debunks several common, long-standing myths related to automotive engine oil. One prevalent misconception is that oil turning dark means it needs to be changed immediately; in reality, this often indicates the oil's detergents are working correctly to clean the engine. Another myth is that switching an older car from conventional to synthetic oil will cause leaks, a belief rooted in outdated 1970s oil formulations. The piece also clarifies that simply topping up low oil is not a substitute for a full oil change and stresses the importance of replacing the oil filter with every oil change to ensure proper engine lubrication and longevity.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory to Russia, dismissing a planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Vladimir Putin as potentially producing "dead solutions." His comments followed Trump's suggestion that a peace deal might involve "some swapping of territories" and his plan to meet the Russian leader in Alaska without Ukraine's initial presence. Zelenskyy emphasized that any meaningful peace negotiations must include Kyiv and respect the nation's constitutional integrity, warning that decisions made without Ukraine's involvement are decisions against peace. The summit is being closely watched by European allies, who share concerns about being marginalized in the discussions.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Indian cinema reveals a significant evolution in how Bollywood has depicted the region of Kashmir over the decades. Initially portrayed as a romantic, scenic paradise in films from the post-independence era, the region's cinematic image transformed with the rise of anti-India militancy in the late 1980s. Kashmir then became a backdrop for stories of conflict, patriotism, and national security, often reflecting the Indian state's perspective. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," reflect the current government's narrative, highlighting how the industry's lens on Kashmir continues to be shaped by the prevailing political climate.</p>

          <p>A shooting in New York's Times Square early Saturday morning left three people injured, including two teenagers and a 65-year-old man. The incident reportedly began with a fight inside a restaurant that spilled out onto the street at the intersection of 44th Street and Seventh Avenue. The New York Police Department has a 17-year-old suspect in custody and has recovered a firearm from the scene. All three victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The shooting occurred in one of New York's designated "gun-free zones," established under state law in 2022.</p>

          <h2>German Chancellor's Decision to Halt Arms Exports to Israel Sparks Political Backlash</h2>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt weapons exports to Israel for use in Gaza "until further notice" has created a significant political rift within his own conservative coalition. Members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have sharply criticized the move, arguing it breaks with Germany's long-standing policy of special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has also received support from other conservatives and coalition partners, who view it as a necessary response to the Israeli government's recent actions. The debate highlights the intense political and ethical pressures European governments face regarding the conflict.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, this summer has been analyzed and found to be approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia examined fragments of the space rock, which created a fireball in the sky before a cherry-tomato-sized piece struck the house. The meteorite is believed to have originated from the breakup of a much larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter about 470 million years ago. It is the 27th meteorite to be recovered in Georgia.</p>

          <p>A crew of four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from Japan, and a Russian cosmonaut, has safely returned to Earth after a five-month mission aboard the International Space Station. Their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego, marking the conclusion of NASA's 10th commercial crew rotation. After undocking from the station, the journey back took approximately 17.5 hours. The crew, who appeared healthy and in good spirits upon recovery, conducted over 200 scientific experiments during their 148 days in orbit, studying subjects like plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity.</p>

          <p>The police officer killed during a shooting near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta has been identified as 33-year-old David Rose, a Marine veteran and father. The suspected gunman, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was also found dead at the scene. Investigators are reportedly exploring the theory that White was motivated by a belief that he had been harmed by the COVID-19 vaccine, with neighbors noting his outspoken opposition to them. The attack, which left bullet marks on several CDC buildings, has highlighted concerns about violence directed at public health institutions and their employees.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators participated in an anti-immigration protest in Nuneaton, England, marching through the town center. The event was organized following recent claims by a local council leader that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. The protest was one of several similar actions held across England, reflecting heightened tensions around immigration issues. Police, who were present at the largely peaceful event, made one arrest on suspicion of making threats. A small group of counter-protesters also attended but were moved on by officers to prevent confrontations with the larger group.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were inspecting the site and dismantling its contents as part of a UN-backed ceasefire agreement with Israel, which requires the removal of unauthorized weapons in the country. The incident occurred near the city of Tyre, a region where tensions remain high following months of cross-border fire between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group. The blast underscores the dangers involved in implementing the ceasefire and the volatile security situation in southern Lebanon, as the government faces pressure to disarm Hezbollah.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a severe environmental crisis driven by a combination of overfishing, plastic pollution, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches and nets filled with plastic waste, while industrial trawlers deplete fish stocks. Coastal sewage and land reclamation further damage marine ecosystems. In response, nations like Egypt and Algeria are launching initiatives to protect coastlines, reduce plastic use, and monitor fishing activity. Despite these efforts and new international agreements like the High Seas Treaty, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical, urging for more direct involvement and effective enforcement to save their livelihoods.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering has become a dominant force in American politics, particularly over the last 15 years. It traces the origins of the modern strategy to the 2010 Republican "Redmap" project, which used sophisticated data and targeted funding to flip state legislatures and redraw congressional districts for a decade-long advantage. The piece explains how this has entrenched incumbents, insulated politicians from public opinion, and led to legal battles and grassroots reform efforts. It also discusses the 2019 Supreme Court ruling that closed federal courts to these claims, setting the stage for the current partisan redistricting battles.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic visit to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, intended for the family of a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The deceased, 21-year-old Michael Gloss, was the son of a CIA deputy director and had joined Russian forces in 2023 after expressing pro-Russian views online. The award, a Soviet-era Order of Lenin, represents a complex and unusual gesture amid tense U.S.-Russia relations ahead of a planned presidential summit. The CIA had previously stated that Gloss suffered from mental health issues and his death was a personal tragedy, not a national security matter.</p>
