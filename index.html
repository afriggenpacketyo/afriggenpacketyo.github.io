          <p>A Florida jury has convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges related to his 2024 assassination attempt against then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at a golf course. Routh, who chose to represent himself during the trial, created a disturbance in the courtroom by attempting to stab himself in the neck with a pen immediately after the guilty verdict was announced. This was the second such attempt on Trump's life in 2024, following a separate shooting incident at a Pennsylvania rally. Routh now faces a potential life sentence for his crimes, which included attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer.</p>

          <p>Car buyers are rushing to dealerships to purchase electric vehicles before the federal tax credits of up to $7,500 expire on September 30. The credits, established under the Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by the Trump administration, leading to record EV sales in August. To clear inventory, dealerships are offering additional incentives, with some lease rates dropping to as low as $40 per month, creating a temporary but significant boom in the EV market. This has created a short-term benefit for consumers and dealers alike before a potential market shift.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a significant shift in his administration's policy towards the war in Ukraine, stating for the first time that he believes the country is in a position to win back all of its lost territory from Russia. This update came after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and marks a departure from previous suggestions of land concessions. Separately, Senate Democrats have initiated an investigation into White House border czar Tom Homan regarding corruption allegations. The president also asserted that NATO allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, signaling escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>A powerful late-summer monsoon in Southern California has left a trail of destruction, including destroyed homes, a closed highway, and the death of a two-year-old child. The storm caused severe mudslides and flash floods, particularly impacting the burn scars of the San Bernardino County mountains. The child was tragically killed when a vehicle was washed away by floodwaters in Barstow, while several families in mountain communities lost their homes and belongings to the destructive debris flows. Authorities are now assessing the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's public warnings against its use, this article examines the scientific debate over acetaminophen (Tylenol) and its potential link to autism. While some observational studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more robust research has found no definitive causal link, with one major Swedish study attributing the connection to other factors like genetics. Medical experts continue to stress that untreated fever or pain during pregnancy poses known, significant risks to both mother and child, and that acetaminophen remains one of the safest available options for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Donald Trump presented a raw version of his "America First" ideology, harshly criticizing European allies for their immigration and green energy policies, which he labeled a "con job." He questioned the UN's overall effectiveness and took a newly aggressive stance on the war in Ukraine, calling Russia a "paper tiger." The address was notable for the audience's silent reception, a stark contrast to the laughter his 2018 speech provoked. This article analyzes the speech as a clear exposition of his worldview, aimed at his supporters while alienating many global leaders.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly canceled a planned meeting with top congressional Democrats, significantly raising the likelihood of a federal government shutdown when funding expires on September 30. The talks were intended to negotiate a deal, but Trump rejected what he called "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democratic leaders. A key point of contention is the Democrats' insistence that any funding agreement must include protections for healthcare programs, such as extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, a condition the administration has so far been unwilling to meet.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China are reportedly in the final stages of negotiating a massive order for Boeing aircraft, a development that has boosted the company's stock. According to U.S. officials visiting Beijing, the deal is a key component of broader trade talks aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China. This would be the first major aircraft sale from Boeing to China since the first Trump administration, reflecting a potential breakthrough in ongoing and often tense trade discussions between the two economic superpowers.

          <h2>Fed Chair Jerome Powell Calls Political Accusations Against the Central Bank a 'Cheap Shot'</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell forcefully defended the central bank's independence, dismissing claims that its decisions on interest rates are politically motivated as a "cheap shot." Without directly naming President Trump, Powell addressed the administration's ongoing pressure campaign and public criticism, asserting that the Fed's actions are driven solely by economic data. The comments come after the White House installed a new governor on the Fed's board who has already dissented on monetary policy, highlighting the growing political tensions surrounding the institution.</p>

          <p>A group of 34 Palestinian students who were evacuated from Gaza have arrived in the United Kingdom to begin their fully funded university scholarships. This marks the first time since the war began that students have been officially assisted in leaving the territory to study in the UK. While celebrating the opportunity, supporters noted the difficult circumstances, as the students' families remain in the conflict zone and some scholarship recipients declined their places because government rules prevented them from bringing their children with them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cases of infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from CDC scientists. The rise is primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort treatments known as carbapenems. Researchers warn that these once-rare infections are becoming more common domestically, posing a grave public health danger by potentially turning routine issues like urinary tract infections into chronic, difficult-to-treat problems.</p>

          <p>Two of the largest local television station owners in the U.S., Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair, have confirmed they will not broadcast "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC-affiliated channels following the show's return. Disney had reinstated the program after a brief suspension prompted by Kimmel's controversial monologue linking the MAGA movement to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The station groups cited the need for "respectful, constructive dialogue" as their reason for preempting the show, leaving it unavailable in dozens of U.S. markets.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and President Donald Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting in Washington D.C. on October 20. This formal meeting was scheduled after Albanese was initially left off the president's public schedule during the UN General Assembly. The announcement followed Trump's UN speech where he criticized allies, including Australia, for recognizing a Palestinian state and dismissed climate change efforts as a "con job." The upcoming meeting is expected to cover the AUKUS security pact, defense spending, and trade tariffs.</p>
