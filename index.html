          <p>Starling Bank, backed by Goldman Sachs, reported a 26% drop in annual profit, with profit before tax at £223.4 million for the year ending March 31, 2025. Revenue increased by 5% to £714 million, a slowdown from the previous year's 50% growth. The profit drop was attributed to a £29 million fine from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority for financial crime prevention failings, as well as issues with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme related to Covid-era business loan fraud. Starling was one of the banks approved to lend cash to firms during the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global weather agencies are forecasting a high likelihood of new annual temperature records being broken within the next five years, leading to more extreme weather events. There is an 80% chance that the world will experience another record-breaking year, and a significant possibility that the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold set by the Paris climate accord will be surpassed. Scientists also suggest a slight chance of exceeding 2 degrees Celsius of warming before the end of the decade.

The judge's order came after a lawsuit by detainees claiming they were unable to raise fears of torture.

          <p>Turkey is implementing new regulations that impose fines on airline passengers who unbuckle their seat belts, open overhead compartments, or occupy the aisle before the plane has come to a complete stop. The updated rules, intended to improve safety and ensure orderly disembarkation, were introduced following passenger complaints and flight inspections revealing safety violations during taxiing after landing. Airlines operating flights in Turkey must now include a revised in-flight announcement warning passengers of the new regulations and the potential for fines. While the exact amount of the fines is not specified, Turkish media reports suggest they could be up to $70.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are causing life-or-death delays in treatment for cancer patients, according to a report in The Guardian. Natalie Phelps, a 43-year-old mother with stage 4 colorectal cancer, is experiencing significant delays in her cell-based immunotherapy trial due to staff reductions at the NIH. Scientists have lost their jobs, and grants have been terminated, affecting treatment for cancer patients and delaying discoveries. Phelps' treatment, initially scheduled for mid-June, has been postponed until after mid-July, causing anxiety and requiring her to make difficult decisions about her care.</p>

          <p>The US agricultural sector is facing uncertainty due to potential changes in federal immigration policies under the Trump administration, impacting both undocumented and guest workers. Farmers are concerned about attracting workers to rural fields, while the future of the H-2A guest worker program remains unclear. While some advocate for replacing H-2A workers with local labor and automation, farmers argue that US citizens are unwilling to do the work, and eliminating H-2A workers could disrupt the food system. Meanwhile, undocumented workers, who make up about 40% of the agricultural workforce, face the threat of mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are offering advice on how to recover financially after the high-spending month of May, dubbed "Maycember" due to its resemblance to the holiday season. The experts recommend going back to a basic budget, reviewing spending, and reassessing financial plans to regain control. If credit card debt has accumulated, they suggest immediately addressing it using repayment strategies like the avalanche or snowball method. Automating savings and scaling back on discretionary spending are also recommended to rebuild financial stability, and to plan ahead for next year's 'Maycember'.</p>

          <p>The United States has lost control of its maritime capacity, becoming heavily reliant on foreign-built, owned, and crewed ships for international trade and military supplies. Only a tiny fraction of large vessels are built in the U.S., while China dominates shipbuilding. This dependency has national security implications, including a shortage of civilian sailors for Navy support vessels and a lack of surge capacity for naval construction. A return to regulated competition, similar to the mid-20th century system, is needed to revive the U.S. maritime industry and ensure it operates in the public interest.</p>

          <p>A senior correspondent at Vox argues that the socialist left's materialist analysis often misinterprets the rise of the far right. The left tends to attribute right-wing populism to economic anxieties stemming from neoliberal policies and betrayed working-class voters. However, the author contends that this materialist view overlooks the independent causal force of ideas, values, and identities in shaping political behavior. By focusing solely on material interests, the left fails to recognize that people arrive at beliefs for various reasons, leading to ineffective strategies for countering the far right.</p>

          <p>A group of 380 writers and organizations, including Zadie Smith, Ian McEwan, and Russell T Davies, have signed an open letter calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The letter describes Israel's military campaign in the territory as "genocidal" and urges people to join them in "ending our collective silence and inaction in the face of horror." The writers also call for the immediate and unrestricted distribution of food and medical aid in Gaza by the UN. The authors assert their opposition to antisemitism, anti-Jewish, and anti-Israeli prejudice, and stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinian, Jewish, and Israeli people to the genocidal policies of the current Israeli government.</p>
