          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's economic proposals, drawing parallels to the "disastrous" policies of former Conservative PM Liz Truss. Burnham, who has faced speculation about a Labour leadership challenge, advocates for a 50p top income tax rate and tax cuts for lower earners, outlining a rival economic vision. This political maneuvering occurs amidst broader economic concerns, including the cost of living crisis and upcoming elections, with Starmer aiming to unify the party at its autumn conference. The article highlights the internal dynamics of the Labour party and the government's focus on fiscal stability, despite recent controversies involving his deputy and US ambassador, and worries about upcoming election performances.</p>

          <p>Anonymous shale oil executives, surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, assert that President Donald Trump's policies are negatively impacting investment and the future of the U.S. shale industry. They criticize Trump's push for lower crude prices and higher tariffs, leading to significant uncertainty and delayed investment decisions, with nearly 80% of executives delaying plans. Executives predict a "twilight of shale" with widespread layoffs and industry consolidation, arguing that Trump's "economic ignorance" is harming the sector. The article highlights a disconnect between the administration's pro-fossil fuel rhetoric and the industry's on-the-ground economic realities, with some warning of future backlash against traditional energy.

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a landmark $1.5 billion settlement between AI startup Anthropic and a group of authors in a copyright infringement lawsuit. The authors alleged that Anthropic illegally used their books, obtained from pirated databases like Library Genesis, to train its AI models. This settlement, the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, mandates Anthropic to pay approximately $3,000 per book plus interest and destroy the infringing datasets. The article underscores the growing legal challenges faced by AI companies regarding intellectual property and sets a significant precedent for defining copyright infringement in the artificial intelligence era.</p>

          <p>European NATO leaders are increasingly preparing for potential direct conflict with Russia, following a series of brazen Russian airspace incursions into Poland and Estonia, hundreds of miles from Ukraine. These incidents, involving both drones and manned aircraft, have significantly escalated tensions, prompting discussions for increased air defense investment and a "drone wall" to counter future provocations. The article highlights a shift in strategy from merely containing the Ukraine war to actively defending NATO territory, with some leaders, including President Trump, supporting shooting down intruding aircraft. This situation, reminiscent of a 2015 incident with Turkey, raises questions about containing potential escalation and testing NATO unity.</p>

          <p>Emergency 911 services across Mississippi and Louisiana experienced widespread outages Thursday afternoon due to damage to AT&T fiber optic lines. The disruption affected major cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans, prompting law enforcement agencies to advise residents to use local phone numbers for emergencies. While some services were gradually restored, with New Orleans' system returning to full functionality by late afternoon, officials confirmed the incident was caused by an accidental fiber cut, not a malicious attack. The article underscores the critical vulnerability of public safety infrastructure and the rapid response required to inform the public during such widespread disruptions.</p>

          <p>The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed federal agencies to prepare for large-scale firings of employees, rather than traditional furloughs, if the government shuts down next week. This unprecedented move, which Democrats denounce as "intimidation tactics," significantly escalates pressure in ongoing partisan budget negotiations. The dispute centers on Democratic demands for extending Affordable Care Act healthcare subsidies, which President Trump falsely claims are for "illegal aliens" and refuses to include in short-term funding. The article highlights the potential for massive upheaval in the federal workforce and increased political polarization surrounding the budget impasse, with some previously fired employees even being asked to return.</p>

This alarming increase, from an average of 71 cases annually, highlights the growing threats to marine life, including shipping traffic, noise pollution, and disease, which diminish whales' ability to survive. The report coincides with proposed funding cuts for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and potential weakening of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

China has emerged as a global leader in scientific research, producing 33.8% of the world’s highly cited papers and leading in 57 out of 64 key technologies, including artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

A federal judge previously blocked Trump's removal, citing insufficient grounds under the 1913 law establishing the Fed, which allows removal only "for cause" for misconduct while in office. Cook, supported by former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries, contends Trump's claims of mortgage fraud relate to actions prior to her appointment and are a pretext for her monetary policy stance.

          <p>U.S. new car sales have experienced a surprising boost, leading Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million vehicles, up 4.6% year-over-year. This unexpected demand is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices, particularly for electric vehicles ahead of expiring federal tax credits. While the first three quarters saw robust sales, analysts predict a slowdown in the fourth quarter and into next year as these factors take effect, with larger automakers gaining market share. The article highlights how changing policies and consumer anticipation are temporarily influencing the automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of CarMax plummeted 20% following the used auto retailer's announcement of fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations, closing at its lowest price since March 2020. The stock's decline led to a market cap of $6.84 billion. CEO Bill Nash described the quarter as "challenging," attributing the decline to changing market conditions, sales pulled forward by tariff fears, and depreciation in its inventory fleet. The article notes that other auto retailers' stocks also experienced declines in the wake of CarMax's performance, indicating broader market sensitivity to these results as an early barometer.

          <p>Bestselling author Jillian Lauren, wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, will avoid jail time after a judge granted her mental health diversion for shooting at Los Angeles Police Department officers. The incident occurred when officers entered her backyard while pursuing suspects from a high-speed hit-and-run chase, and Lauren, armed with a handgun, fired at them before being wounded when they returned fire. Lauren was not connected to the initial chase, and it's unclear if she heard commands. Under the diversion agreement, she must not own firearms, avoid drugs and alcohol, and attend therapy, with all charges dismissed if she complies for two years.</p>

The article highlights three key reasons to consider opening a HELOC this fall: their affordability compared to other borrowing products like personal loans and credit cards, the potential for further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve which would benefit variable-rate HELOCs, and the flexibility of making interest-only payments during the initial draw period.
