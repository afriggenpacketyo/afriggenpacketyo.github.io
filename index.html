          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol, experienced a sharp drop after a report suggested that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will soon release findings linking the medication's use during pregnancy to autism. Kenvue has strongly refuted any causal connection, stating that its position is supported by the FDA and major medical organizations that affirm the safety of acetaminophen when used as directed. This development aligns with Kennedy's broader history of questioning established medical science, including vaccine efficacy, from his influential government position. The full impact remains uncertain pending the official release of the HHS report.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to initiate a Section 301 trade investigation in response to what he describes as discriminatory penalties imposed by the European Union on major U.S. technology firms like Google and Apple. Writing on his social media platform, Trump stated that he could not allow such actions against American companies to stand and would be forced to take measures to nullify the fines. This statement signals a potential escalation in transatlantic trade tensions, centering on the regulation and taxation of large technology corporations. The Section 301 process allows the U.S. to investigate and retaliate against foreign trade practices deemed unfair.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old man, Hugo Hernandez-Mendez, has been charged with the first- and second-degree murder of 19-year-old Dacara Thompson in Prince George's County, Maryland. Thompson was reported missing in late August, and her body was subsequently discovered near a highway. According to media reports, Hernandez-Mendez is in the U.S. without legal authorization and was out on bail for a previous DWI arrest at the time of the alleged crime. Investigators utilized security footage to connect Thompson to a vehicle driven by the suspect, which led them to evidence at his residence suggesting the murder occurred there.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, though the right-leaning media outlet has been granted an opportunity to submit an amended complaint. Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that the initial filing was an impermissible "shotgun complaint" because several counts improperly incorporated all allegations from the first count. Newsmax, which accuses Fox News of monopolistic behavior to suppress conservative media competitors, stated it views the dismissal as a technical matter and intends to refile. Fox News has characterized the lawsuit as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own failures in the marketplace.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:16:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has become a primary target of Russian smear campaigns and hate propaganda, which intensified after a suspected GPS sabotage incident involving her plane. Russian officials and state-controlled media frequently use derogatory and sexist language, such as calling her an "evil aunt gynecologist," to undermine her credibility and portray her as an unserious leader.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle after the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Rather than simply filling the vacant positions, Starmer used the opportunity to significantly recast his government, appointing new individuals to the major offices of Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an assertion of authority and an attempt to re-energize his administration, which has faced challenges including declining approval ratings. The reshuffle results in women holding the top three cabinet posts below the prime minister for the first time, a strategic decision as the government prepares for future political battles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling in August, with the economy adding a mere 22,000 jobs, falling far short of expectations and continuing a summer slowdown. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%, and previous months' data were revised downward, revealing a net loss of 13,000 jobs in June—the first monthly decline since the pandemic. This report highlights job losses in federal employment and manufacturing, creating concern about the economic outlook amid trade tariffs and uncertainty. The weak figures are likely to increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates to stimulate economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" indicates a significant strategic pivot away from its core business of manufacturing electric vehicles towards a future dominated by artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and autonomous robotaxis. The document notably lacks any mention of new electric car models, instead focusing on a vision of "sustainable abundance" enabled by Tesla-made robots. This shift comes as Tesla's car sales have declined globally amid increased competition and controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. While Musk has long envisioned an autonomous future, this plan solidifies the company's high-stakes gamble on unproven AI technology over its established and profitable car division.</p>

The case involved an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage, finding she had spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. The judge awarded the worker over £14,000, noting that the time was not excessive, much of it was for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against such activity. The ruling suggests the real motive for the dismissal was to replace her before she accrued two years of service.</p>

          <p>Vanesa Estrella, co-owner of the iconic El Pachuco Zoot Suits store in Fullerton, has channeled the resilient spirit of pachuco culture into a role as a school district trustee. After years of volunteering and feeling that the concerns of families in her historically neglected district were not being heard, she successfully ran for a board position. Since her election, Estrella has focused on supporting undocumented families by helping pass a Safe Schools resolution and partnering with legal aid services. She aims to bridge the gap between immigrant families and the school district, advocating for their needs while also working to close achievement gaps.</p>

          <p>Investigators have identified Sean Patrick McNulty, a Navy diver who died in 1997, as the perpetrator in a series of cold case home invasion and sexual assault cases from the 1980s and 90s. The breakthrough connects crimes in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana through DNA evidence and investigative genealogy. McNulty had been a suspect in one of the cases before his death by suicide, and a biological sample from that investigation was used to match him to the other crime scenes. Authorities are now notifying the surviving victims, offering a resolution to the violent attacks that occurred decades ago.</p>

          <p>The NBA has launched an investigation into allegations that the Los Angeles Clippers circumvented salary cap rules through a deal involving star player Kawhi Leonard and Aspiration Partners, a now-bankrupt firm. Reports allege Leonard received $28 million from Aspiration for a no-show job, a payment potentially arranged to supplement his official team salary. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, who was also an investor in Aspiration, has denied any wrongdoing, stating the team's contract with Leonard and its sponsorship deal with the company were completed separately before Leonard was introduced to the firm. The case recalls the severe penalties imposed on the Minnesota Timberwolves for a similar violation in 2000.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable environment for reinvesting their funds. Financial experts suggest several alternatives to simply rolling over a CD into a new one at a lower rate. Options include moving the money into a high-yield savings account, which offers comparable rates with greater flexibility, or a money market account that combines high interest with check-writing capabilities. Alternatively, locking in a current rate with a new long-term CD can provide security against future rate drops, despite being lower than recent highs. (not investment advice)</p>

This unexpected growth means that Wall Street's future earnings estimates were too low, causing analysts to significantly revise their projections upward.
