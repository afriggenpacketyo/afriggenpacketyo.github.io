          <p>Mexico conducted its first judicial elections, becoming the only country to select judges and magistrates by popular vote, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor. Supporters argue it will overhaul the judicial system, addressing corruption and inefficiency. Critics fear the vote will politicize the judiciary, especially in a country struggling with crime and gang violence. Turnout was low, with voters expressing confusion over the numerous candidates and some feeling pressured or disillusioned with the system. 60</p>

          <p>China refuted U.S. claims of violating the Geneva trade agreement, accusing Washington of breaching deal terms, which signals worsening relations between the two economic superpowers. Trade tensions escalated after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals and threatened to revoke visas for Chinese students. China has maintained control over rare earth exports, contrary to U.S. expectations, and the Chinese spokesperson said the U.S. has continued to unilaterally provoke new economic and trade frictions, increasing the uncertainty and instability in the bilateral economic and trade relations (not investment advice).

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has strongly denied firing on Palestinians at a Gaza humanitarian aid site, releasing drone footage purportedly showing armed individuals shooting at civilians. These denials came after reports that at least 26 Palestinians were killed and 175 wounded while attempting to obtain food, according to Hamas-run health officials and witnesses. The IDF claims Hamas is disrupting aid distribution efforts and spreading false rumors to undermine Israel's aid efforts. The agency also said that Hamas has done everything it can to disrupt food distribution efforts in the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>With increased deportation efforts in the U.S., residents and citizens are concerned about traveling outside the country. Immigration lawyer Álex Gálvez explains that while citizens should not fear questioning upon return, residents are subject to an officer's discretion. Residents staying abroad for over six months risk being considered as having abandoned their residency, and those with criminal records face potential denial of entry and deportation proceedings. DACA and TPS recipients face similar risks, and although advance parole permits exist, their approval is uncertain; naturalization is the safest route.</p>

          <p>A report warns that students may face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial challenges lead to course cutbacks. A review by Universities UK found reluctance to collaborate due to competition laws, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledges the sector's financial difficulties and supports collaboration where possible. The report suggests universities should be allowed to agree on which courses to close or merge to avoid isolated decisions. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and rising fees, and the government is reviewing higher education funding.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, which has drawn criticism from US President Donald Trump and local political groups. The government says the law is needed to increase black ownership of land, as most private farmland is still owned by white people. Legal experts say expropriation without compensation would occur in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes. The academic was referring to the fact that Trump has opposed the law, saying it discriminates against white farmers and their land was being "seized" – a charge the government denies.</p>
