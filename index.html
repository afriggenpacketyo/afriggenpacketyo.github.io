          <p>In an exclusive phone interview with the BBC, former President Donald Trump conveyed his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, yet indicated he is not entirely finished with him regarding the Ukraine conflict. Trump announced new plans to send weapons to Ukraine and warned of severe tariffs on Russia if a ceasefire is not achieved within 50 days. He also notably endorsed NATO, a significant shift from his prior criticisms, affirming support for its collective defense principle and acknowledging European nations paying their share. Trump further discussed UK relations, Brexit, and his anticipated second state visit, emphasizing his goal of "Saving America" and its renewed strength.</p>

          <p>Thousands of European vehicles, including cars, vans, and trucks, are sitting idle at Belgium's Port of Antwerp-Bruges due to the impact of President Donald Trump's new 25% tariffs on EU imports. The port reported a significant drop in vehicle transport to the US, with a 15.9% decline in passenger cars and vans and a nearly one-third decrease in heavy equipment. This situation has created a "giant car park" at one of the world's largest transport hubs, reflecting the immediate shock of the tariffs on transatlantic trade. The industry awaits a potential trade agreement by August 1st. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino is persistently pursuing the expansion of the Club World Cup, with proposals for a 48-team tournament in 2029 and discussions about holding it more frequently. Despite initial indifference and opposition from player unions, the substantial $1 billion prize fund has garnered significant club support, validating Infantino's ambitious vision. Challenges persist, including unresolved player welfare concerns and an uncertain qualification process. The event's financial success, generating $2.1 billion in revenue, underpins FIFA's continued push for global football dominance.</p>

          <p>This Fox News commentary asserts that President Donald Trump is effectively delivering on his campaign promises, including sealing the border and imposing tariffs, despite what it characterizes as "liberal media" portraying his actions as detrimental to democracy. The article suggests that the media's framing of Trump's policies as moving backward reflects a "Resistance" narrative, overlooking his popular vote win. It also touches on the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, which it describes as a public relations disaster for the administration. This perspective highlights a partisan divide in political reporting.</p>

The report emphasizes recognizing Judaism as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure discrimination is appropriately tackled. It also calls for consistent policing of antisemitic crimes and better education, especially in faith schools, to prevent harmful tropes.</p>

While the initiative is welcomed by some, critics argue that the UK's charging infrastructure, with only 82,000 public points for 1.3 million EVs, remains a significant barrier to wider adoption.

          <p>President Donald Trump's announcement of "massive" US weapons sales to Ukraine, including Patriot missile systems, signals a decisive shift in his policy towards Russia and the ongoing war. This move, made alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, follows Trump's growing exasperation with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict, contrasting with earlier, more conciliatory tones. While the full military impact remains uncertain without a specific dollar amount, the Guardian analysis suggests it's a significant diplomatic turning point, possibly influenced by Putin overplaying his hand.

          <p>Intense storms caused severe flash flooding across the New York City metropolitan area, leading to significant disruptions in transport and infrastructure. Subway services experienced major delays due to flooded stations, and Metro-North Railroad service was impacted, prompting commuters to postpone travel. Roads and highways in northern suburbs and New Jersey were also submerged, with numerous vehicle rescues reported, and New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency. The slow movement of the storm meant persistent heavy rainfall, with initial estimates exceeding six inches in some areas, causing widespread damage to businesses and homes.</p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are demanding extensive tenant information from landlords via subpoenas, including leases, applications, and IDs, raising concerns about privacy and potential Fair Housing Act violations. These subpoenas, issued by USCIS's anti-fraud unit and not signed by a judge, are seen by critics as a new tactic by the Trump administration to facilitate mass deportations. Legal experts question their legitimacy and advise landlords that compliance may be optional, highlighting intimidation tactics. The move is viewed as an attempt to locate individuals in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>China's Space Pioneer has successfully conducted a critical ground-based stress test for its Tianlong-3 rocket's first stage, a year after an explosive mishap during a static-fire test that saw the rocket lift off unexpectedly and crash. The nine-engine first stage, which generates nearly 900 tonnes of thrust, successfully simulated key mission phases including fueling, lift-off, flight, and recovery. The company confirmed the structure held up under all test conditions, marking a significant step forward for the Tianlong-3 program. This success is crucial for China's ambitious space development goals and reusable rocket technology.</p>

          <p>The nearly century-old Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim, a rustic retreat designed to immerse visitors in the landscape, was tragically destroyed by a wind-whipped wildfire. The blaze, which began on July 4th, consumed the lodge and dozens of other structures, leading to hundreds of evacuations. This iconic building, the only lodging on the remote North Rim, was cherished for its tranquility and picturesque views, drawing millions annually. Despite this devastating loss, which echoes a previous fire in 1932, there is optimism from former park service officials that the lodge will be rebuilt and regain its status as a beloved natural getaway.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its culpability in the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was struck by a Model S sedan on autopilot while stargazing. The car allegedly ran red lights and a stop sign at nearly 70mph, causing her death and seriously injuring her boyfriend. Lawyers argue the driver assistance feature should have warned the driver and braked, while Tesla maintains the driver, who was distracted by a dropped phone, is solely to blame. This trial is significant as past cases against Tesla regarding its autopilot have typically been dismissed or settled, highlighting ongoing safety concerns with autonomous driving technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, ending a years-long agreement and aligning with President Trump's broader strategy of increasing tariffs on trading partners. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the decision aims to protect domestic tomato farmers from what he calls "unfair trade practices." While supporters believe this will boost the US industry, critics, including lawmakers and the US Chamber of Commerce, warn of higher consumer prices, emptier shelves, and potential retaliatory tariffs from Mexico.

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University suggests animals react to sounds made by plants, indicating a previously unseen ecosystem of communication. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants emitting distress sounds, suggesting the moths perceive the plants as unhealthy. These sounds, inaudible to humans, can be detected by many insects, bats, and some mammals. The discovery opens up a vast, unexplored field of study into how animals and potentially other plants use these acoustic signals for decisions related to pollination, shelter, or resource conservation.</p>
