          <h2>Starbucks Reports Sixth Straight Quarter of Same-Store Sales Decline Amid Turnaround Efforts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 16:14:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, a significant indicator of ongoing challenges for the coffee giant. While global same-store sales fell by 2%, steeper than anticipated, the company's overall revenue of $9.5 billion managed to beat Wall Street expectations, causing a slight increase in its stock price. CEO Brian Niccol asserted that the company's turnaround strategy is progressing, highlighting improved partner engagement in the U.S. and competitive price adjustments in China that led to 2% sales growth there. Looking ahead, Starbucks plans to introduce new products like protein cold foam and a revamped rewards program to reinvigorate its brand and attract customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Spotify Stock Plummets Over 11% Following Disappointing Earnings and Weak Forecast</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spotify's shares experienced their most significant single-day drop in over a year, falling more than 11% after the company reported disappointing quarterly results and issued weak guidance. The music streaming service posted a net loss of 86 million euros, a stark contrast to the net income from the previous year, and its revenue of 4.19 billion euros fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged the poor performance as an "execution challenge" rather than a strategic failure, expressing confidence in the company's long-term ambitions. The weak forecast for the upcoming quarter, which anticipates a significant headwind from foreign exchange rates, further contributed to the negative market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Job search and employee review companies Indeed and Glassdoor are laying off approximately 1,300 employees, which constitutes about 6% of their parent company's HR tech workforce. The move comes as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, intensifies its focus on integrating artificial intelligence into the hiring process to increase efficiency and reduce manual labor costs. In a memo to employees, CEO Hisayuki Idekoba stated that AI is transforming the industry and the company must adapt accordingly. As part of this strategic shift, Glassdoor's operations will be merged into Indeed, and its CEO will be stepping down from his position.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has stated her conditions for testifying before a House committee. In a letter from her attorney, Maxwell expressed willingness to provide a deposition but only if she is granted congressional immunity from further prosecution or receives a presidential pardon. Her lawyer argued that testifying without these protections would compromise her constitutional rights and pending legal appeals, including a petition to the Supreme Court. The House Oversight Committee has rejected the possibility of granting immunity, setting up a potential standoff where Maxwell may invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has provided a new explanation for the end of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, claiming the falling out occurred because Epstein repeatedly hired away employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking to reporters, Trump specified that the issue involved workers from the spa, including Virginia Giuffre, who was a teenage locker-room attendant at the time. Trump stated he banned Epstein from the club after warning him against poaching staff, an admonishment Epstein allegedly ignored. Giuffre, who later accused Epstein of abuse, was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago before being sexually assaulted by Epstein on multiple occasions.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will pay $6.45 million to resolve a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged their civil rights were violated during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The lawsuit claimed the university enabled antisemitism by allowing an encampment to create a "Jew Exclusion Zone," which barred Jewish individuals from parts of the campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA has agreed to a 15-year injunction prohibiting the exclusion of Jewish individuals from any university programs or areas. The funds will be distributed among the plaintiffs, several Jewish community organizations, a UCLA antisemitism initiative, and legal fees, marking a significant outcome in campus-related litigation since October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to Scotland, which combined a golfing holiday with geopolitical discussions, was met with a divided reception that reflects the country's complex political landscape. While anti-Trump protesters gathered to voice their opposition, the president held court at his golf resort, hosting UK and Scottish leaders and appearing to make progress on diplomatic fronts. Polling data suggests Trump's politics do not align with the majority of Scots, and First Minister John Swinney has been a vocal critic. However, Swinney adopted a more pragmatic tone during the visit, focusing on economic issues like U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, highlighting the delicate balance between personal politics and national interests.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement to recognize a Palestinian state by September is a significant shift in British foreign policy, but its impact remains uncertain. The recognition is conditional on Israel taking substantive steps toward a ceasefire in Gaza and committing to a two-state solution, conditions that seem unlikely to be met given the current Israeli government's composition. This move is seen as a response to both public and political pressure within Starmer's own Labour party. However, critics question whether the pledge will amount to more than a symbolic gesture, as its ultimate success heavily depends on the actions of Israeli and Hamas leadership, as well as the influential position of the United States.</p>

          <p>Flash floods in Nigeria's northeastern Adamawa state have resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people, with another 11 individuals reported missing. The flooding, which began on Sunday following heavy rains, has submerged several communities and displaced over 5,500 people, according to the UN and Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). A camp has been established to provide shelter and basic materials for those affected. This event is part of a deadly rainy season across Nigeria, which has been exacerbated by poor infrastructure and, according to scientists, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events fueled by climate change.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has announced that the number of people killed as a result of Israel's military offensive has exceeded 60,000 since the conflict began in October 2023. The latest figures include over 18,500 children and nearly 9,800 women. The ministry also reported that at least 112 people were killed in the 24 hours leading up to Tuesday morning. This grim milestone comes as UN-backed experts warn that a worst-case famine scenario is currently unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Israel launched its campaign in response to the Hamas-led attack on October 7, and it disputes the breakdown of the casualty figures.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its intention to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a crucial scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and allows their regulation under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as "the largest deregulatory action in the history of America," which would eliminate emissions standards for vehicles and other pollution sources. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have condemned the decision, calling it an illegal move that ignores overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change. If finalized, the repeal is expected to face immediate legal challenges from environmental organizations and other stakeholders.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian teacher, Odeh Hathaleen, who contributed to the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," has been shot and killed in the occupied West Bank. According to an activist at the scene and the Palestinian education ministry, Hathaleen was shot by an Israeli settler. The alleged shooter has been identified by residents as Yinon Levy, a settler leader who is under UK sanctions for previous violence against Palestinians. The incident reportedly occurred after a bulldozer from a nearby settlement destroyed Palestinian property. Israeli police are investigating the shooting and have detained an Israeli citizen, while the IDF has detained five Palestinians and two foreign activists who were present.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government is developing a plan to support companies that will be heavily impacted by the steeper U.S. tariffs scheduled to take effect in August. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad stated the plan aims to give affected firms, such as planemaker Embraer, the confidence to maintain their investments, though he denied it would include tax exemptions. The government is still awaiting clarity on the full scope of the tariffs, which President Trump has threatened to raise to 50% on Brazilian imports. Haddad suggested that Brazil would not retaliate with symmetrical tariffs, as that would ultimately harm Brazilian consumers by increasing prices on domestic goods. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes as sources report that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering annexing territories in Gaza as one of several options following the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations.

The meeting also occurs amid public criticism from President Trump regarding the central bank's refusal to ease policy. Despite arguments that inflation risks are limited and the labor market is softening, the consensus on the committee appears to favor holding rates steady for now, postponing any potential cut until at least September.

          <p>President Trump's impending tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have a varied impact across the drug manufacturing industry, according to market analysts. Companies with larger U.S. manufacturing footprints, such as AbbVie and Eli Lilly, are seen as better positioned to handle the duties. Conversely, firms like Novartis and Roche, which have more extensive overseas operations, appear to be at greater risk. The exact tariff rate remains unclear, but experts warn that levies above 50% could be highly punitive, potentially forcing companies to cut research and development spending and disrupting complex global supply chains, which could ultimately affect drug prices and availability for patients.

The current 90-day truce is set to expire on August 12, after which tariffs could "boomerang" back to their previous high levels if no agreement is reached. While negotiators reported that the talks were productive and that their positions are becoming more refined, the ultimate decision on extending the pause rests with the president.</p>
