          <p>A recent investigation by Le Parisien found that Parisian cafes and bars are overcharging foreign tourists, sometimes by as much as 50 percent. A former waitress in Paris, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, reflects on this practice, confirming that while she never scammed customers, upselling and other dishonest tactics are common. She provides practical advice for travelers to avoid being ripped off, such as learning key French phrases, being aware of free items like bread and tap water, and carefully checking the bill before paying.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, in what authorities are calling a random act of violence. The attack occurred near the checkout area, leaving six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition at a local hospital. A deputy arrived within three minutes and took the suspect into custody, with officials crediting the assistance of citizens in the store for helping to apprehend the man and treat the injured.</p>

          <p>Four people have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. The suspects, Brian and Jill Griffeth and Dallin and Liberty Griffeth, are accused of keeping the children in plywood cages under bunk beds. They also allegedly beat the children, sprayed vinegar in their faces as punishment, and treated the four adopted children unfairly compared to their biological offspring. The investigation began after a church member reported concerns, and all children have since been removed from the home.</p>

          <p>The party chief of China's Jilin province, Huang Qiang, has reignited a historical debate with South Korea by emphasizing the Chinese identity of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region. He called for a clear presentation of the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms—known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae—as part of China's history. This move touches on long-standing sensitivities, as both nations claim historical ties to these kingdoms. The remarks were made in the context of China's "century of humiliation," potentially framing the issue within a narrative of national resilience.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is escalating its efforts to control information by suppressing coverage of mass attacks, such as incidents where drivers have hit pedestrians. Since a particularly deadly case in November, authorities have shifted from releasing basic details to imposing information blackouts, scrubbing reports and images from the internet. This censorship, likely intended to prevent copycat crimes and protect local officials' reputations, has led to public pushback online.

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, significantly escalating the country's 27-month civil war.

The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, was established following an agreement with other rebel and civilian groups aiming to create a secular "New Sudan."

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their daughter, while the defense claimed she acted in self-defense after years of abuse. The trial detailed their turbulent relationship, including Ashley's previous accusations of poisoning and violence, none of which resulted in charges against Doug. Benefield was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with the verdict providing what her late husband's family called long-awaited justice.</p>

          <p>An advertisement by the fashion brand Guess in Vogue magazine has generated controversy for featuring a computer-generated model instead of a real person. This marks the first time an AI-generated person has appeared in the magazine, raising concerns about the future of modeling and the promotion of unrealistic beauty standards. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, argue the move is "disheartening" and undermines efforts toward diversity in the industry. The company behind the AI model defends its work, stating it offers another creative choice for brands.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, an ancient seismoscope said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. According to historical texts, the ornate device could not only detect distant earthquakes but also indicate the direction of their epicenter. Despite its legendary status, the invention has been dismissed by some modern scholars as mythical and was removed from school curricula in 2017. The new project aims to restore the lost wonder's reputation using modern science and newly discovered clues.</p>

          <p>Emerging research is strengthening the link between nanoplastics and chronic health issues, with one lab finding plastic particles in human brain tissue for the first time. Scientists believe these microscopic particles, which come from degrading plastic waste, enter our bodies through food, water, and air. A recent study associated living near nanoplastic-polluted oceans with higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Long-term clinical studies are now underway to track the impact on children, with preliminary findings linking plastics to hormonal issues, premature birth, and cognitive abnormalities.</p>
