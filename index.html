          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four people in Lake County, Tennessee, has been apprehended after a week-long manhunt. The victims included Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The victims' infant was found abandoned but unharmed in a different county on the same day the bodies were discovered. Drummond was captured in a wooded area in Jackson and now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping, as authorities continue to investigate the motive for the killings.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Republican primary for South Carolina governor is intensifying, with Rep. Nancy Mace and state Attorney General Alan Wilson emerging as front-runners. Mace launched her campaign criticizing the state's "weak leadership," which Wilson dismissed as "ranting and raving." The rivalry is underscored by Mace's previous allegations that Wilson ignored evidence of sexual assault, a claim he vehemently denies. Both candidates are vying for former President Trump's endorsement, highlighting their respective records and qualifications while trading sharp criticisms in the crowded primary field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, largely due to declining U.S. sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Both brands saw a 5% drop in domestic same-store sales, which executives attributed to ineffective value messaging and increased competition. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform strongly with a 4% same-store sales growth, driven by popular new menu items. The company is implementing leadership changes at KFC and new promotions at Pizza Hut to address the downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has implemented a new phone-sharing system that reroutes calls from local offices to available staff nationwide, intended to reduce wait times. However, employees and advocates report that this often connects callers with agents who lack the jurisdiction to resolve their specific cases, leading to delays and frustration. While the agency claims all staff are equipped to handle inquiries, field office employees state they cannot take action on claims outside their designated office. This change is causing concern that it undermines public confidence and makes it harder for individuals to access their benefits.</p>

Among the affected are six children under ten, and at least two cases have resulted in severe complications. While selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, bypassing sanitation regulations and posing a significant health risk.</p>

          <p>Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," posits that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not a predetermined historical event but rather an accident shaped by specific actions and miscalculations. The article reviews Anderson's work, which focuses on the shah's hubris, the U.S. government's ignorance and inaction, and Ayatollah Khomeini's strategic maneuvering. Anderson argues against grand theories, instead presenting a narrative of contingency where a "freakish convergence of circumstances" allowed a theocratic dictatorship to emerge. The review praises this approach for offering a more instructive understanding of how the Islamic Republic came to power and has endured.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has voiced his support for a controversial Texas redistricting plan, stating that Republicans are "entitled" to the five additional congressional seats the new maps would likely create. His comments come as Texas Democrats have fled the state to deny a legislative quorum and block the plan's passage. Trump also made unsubstantiated claims of gerrymandering in Democratic-controlled states like California and Illinois. The standoff continues as Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested and returned to the state capitol.</p>

          <p>Civic groups and legal experts are raising alarms that the new congressional maps proposed by Texas Republicans are unconstitutional and violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Latino voters. The plan significantly alters districts like that of Rep. Greg Casar in Austin, a Latino-majority district, in what critics call a clear case of racial gerrymandering. Despite significant Hispanic population growth, the new map fails to create additional Latino-majority districts and weakens existing ones.

          <p>This article explores whether purchasing an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, weighing the benefits of guaranteed lifetime income against the drawbacks. For healthy individuals with a long life expectancy, buying an annuity later in life can result in higher monthly payments. However, the illiquidity of the principal, high fees, and potential for not recouping the investment if one's health is poor are significant risks. The optimal time to buy depends on individual circumstances, but many advisors suggest the "sweet spot" is between 70 and 75. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal 2023 Titan submersible implosion concluded the tragedy was "preventable" and resulted from OceanGate's significant safety failures. The 300-page report states the company used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory confusion to operate outside established deep-sea protocols. Investigators identified a "toxic" safety culture, flawed design and testing processes, and noted that the company ignored warnings about hull damage. The report asserts that co-founder Stockton Rush, who died in the implosion, exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of the four other passengers.</p>

          <p>In an unusual legal agreement, Rupert Murdoch will provide regular health updates to Donald Trump's legal team to postpone his deposition in a defamation lawsuit. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's lawyers had sought an expedited deposition, citing the 94-year-old media mogul's age and potential health issues. The deal, which requires a judge's approval, stipulates that Murdoch will provide a sworn declaration of his health and regular updates, or face an immediate deposition if he fails to comply.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on disclosing the immigration status and ethnicity of crime suspects "needs to change" to provide more transparency to the public. Her comments follow a case in Warwickshire where two men, reportedly Afghan, were charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, and police withheld their status, citing national guidelines. The debate is fueled by concerns that a lack of official information can lead to dangerous misinformation and public mistrust, as seen after the Southport murders, while balancing the need for fair trials.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and a strong second-quarter performance that surpassed Wall Street estimates.

The positive outlook comes as the company navigates President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and potential tariffs.
