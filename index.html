          <p>Two individuals responding to a brush fire near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were killed in a shooting ambush. Law enforcement officials reported taking active sniper fire from at least one suspect using a high-powered rifle on Canfield Mountain, prompting a massive police response and warnings for residents to avoid the area. The number of suspects and total casualties remained unconfirmed as the situation unfolded, with Idaho's governor calling the attack a heinous assault on heroic firefighters. The incident triggered a large-scale operation involving local and federal agencies to neutralize the threat.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, citing frustration with partisan gridlock. His announcement followed a direct threat from former President Trump, who vowed to back a primary challenger after Tillis opposed his major tax and spending bill due to its proposed cuts to Medicaid. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, creating a key open seat in a historically Republican state. His departure underscores the internal party pressures shaping the political landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff plans to enter the transfer portal, reportedly anticipating a seven-game suspension from the university for an honor code violation. The violation stems from a sexual assault allegation made against him in a civil lawsuit filed in May, for which he is not facing criminal charges. Retzlaff has denied the allegations, claiming the encounter was consensual and accusing the woman of extortion. The university's strict honor code, which applies to all students, prohibits premarital sex, making the situation complex regardless of the lawsuit's outcome.</p>

The events also commemorated the 1969 Stonewall Riots, a pivotal moment in the fight for equality. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, demonstrating against Hungary's increasingly restrictive laws in a powerful display of resistance and solidarity.</p>

          <p>A female prosecutor in Osaka, Japan, has come forward with allegations that she was sexually assaulted by her former boss, chief prosecutor Kentaro Kitagawa, in 2018.

Kitagawa was indicted and initially admitted to the charge but has since recanted, claiming the encounter was consensual.

Parallel to this grassroots effort, a high-tech de-extinction project funded by investors aims to bring the creature back by genetically engineering the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart.

          <p>Acclaimed German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for a six-decade career of making uncompromising films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent profile, Herzog discusses his philosophy, from shooting "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" in the perilous Amazon to his belief that a filmmaker needs "good criminal energy" to succeed. He famously hauled a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo," rejecting special effects to capture a raw reality. This relentless pursuit of authentic, often dream-like imagery defines his unique and influential body of work.</p>

          <p>A photo album from Auschwitz officer Karl HÃ¶cker reveals the presence of young female secretaries, or "Helferinnen," who were integral to the camp's operations. These women, often recruited from the Nazi Party's League of German Girls, were not just clerical staff but active participants who handled communications detailing the arrival of prisoner transports and the numbers sent to be gassed. The article explores how these young, ideologically committed women could lead seemingly normal lives, as depicted in the photos, while being complicit in mass murder. Their story underscores the pervasive nature of Nazi ideology and the ordinary appearance of its perpetrators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States faces significant challenges in countering unauthorized drone swarms over its territory due to a combination of technological limitations and legal complexities. Standard radar systems are often unable to track small, low-flying drones, and downing them over populated areas poses a major safety risk from debris. Furthermore, jamming drone communication frequencies could disrupt essential civilian services like Wi-Fi and air traffic control. Jurisdictional ambiguity among agencies like the FAA, FBI, and Department of Defense further complicates a coordinated response, leaving a critical gap in national security.</p>

          <p>Lena Herzog, a visual artist and photographer, offers a personal perspective on her husband, filmmaker Werner Herzog, particularly regarding his acting career and public image. She reveals that when they first met, he pretended to be a stuntman, and she finds his roles as villains in films like "Jack Reacher" amusing, seeing them as a caricature of his perceived wild-man persona. Lena believes he is unafraid to make fun of himself and that his public image as an obsessive artist is misleading.

          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog employs a unique and poetic process to create his documentaries, forgoing traditional methods like storyboarding or transcript analysis. Instead, he and his editor watch all raw footage only once, with Herzog taking notes and marking compelling shots with exclamation points to guide the edit. He then crafts his signature narration spontaneously, aiming to imbue images with philosophical questions and a dreamlike quality that transcends simple information. This approach, as seen in his work on films about elephants and the human brain, is designed to create memorable, emotionally resonant sequences that stay with the audience.</p>

The article details numerous concerns raised by whistleblowers, including the late John Barnett, who alleged that poor quality control, missing parts, and improper assembly practices at Boeing's South Carolina plant created potential safety risks. While Boeing has consistently denied that these issues compromised flight safety, the allegations paint a troubling picture of a corporate culture that may have prioritized production speed over rigorous standards, casting a shadow over the aircraft's otherwise strong operational record.</p>

While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the attack only set back Iran's program by months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift the mission's primary goal from destroying nuclear capability to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

          <p>England's national football team received a significant boost as star forward Lauren James made a successful return from a three-month hamstring injury. In a 7-0 victory over Jamaica, James made an immediate impact, providing a pinpoint cross for a goal just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Her return comes just days before England's opening Euro 2025 match against France, giving manager Sarina Wiegman a powerful and versatile attacking option. While her match fitness is still being built, her presence is seen as pivotal for the Lionesses' title defense.</p>
