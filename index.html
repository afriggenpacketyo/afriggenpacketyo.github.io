          <p>Skip Bayless has voiced strong criticism of the Pittsburgh Steelers' decision to sign Aaron Rodgers, labeling the veteran quarterback a "diva" and suggesting he is past his prime. Bayless pointed to Rodgers' performance in his final years with the Green Bay Packers, arguing that he was already declining. He questioned the Steelers' current direction, expressing pity for the franchise. Rodgers agreed to a one-year contract with the Steelers and is expected to attend the team's mandatory minicamp next week, aiming to address the team's quarterback concerns after drafting Will Howard in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. The move has garnered mixed reactions within the sports community. </p>

          <p>Tommy Robinson, a far-right anti-Islam activist, was asked to leave a London Hawksmoor steakhouse after staff members expressed discomfort serving him and his group. The restaurant stated that its decision was not politically motivated but rather a duty of care to ensure the comfort of its staff and guests. Video footage shows a staff member informing Robinson that his colleagues felt uncomfortable serving them and waiving the bill for their drinks. Robinson accused the restaurant of discriminatory behavior based on his political beliefs, leading to calls for a boycott and a temporary suspension of reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants on Tripadvisor.</p>

          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally wrote text messages revealing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if staffers composed them. The inquiry aims to determine how classified strike details ended up on the commercial messaging app Signal, and whether staff members were instructed to delete the messages. The details were shared in two chat groups, one including Vice President JD Vance and other officials, and another with Hegseth's wife. The investigation coincides with concerns about Hegseth's handling of classified information, particularly after details of a missile strike in Yemen were inadvertently shared with the media.</p>

Some lawmakers worry that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could create uncertainties and undermine efforts to pass key tax and domestic policy legislation.

          <p>Dr. Andrew Freeman, a cardiologist, recommends oatmeal as a go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart, emphasizing its high fiber content and nutritional benefits. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it low in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for extra fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that can help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. Freeman advises avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars, and he recommends limiting or avoiding eggs, muffins, and pastries for breakfast due to their high cholesterol and sugar content.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief convicted of rape and murder, has been recaptured by authorities nearly two weeks after escaping from prison. Hardin, who had been serving a 30-year prison term for murder and a 50-year term for rape, was taken into custody approximately 1.5 miles from the prison. He attempted to flee from officers but was quickly apprehended, bringing an end to the search that involved federal law enforcement officials and Border Patrol agents.

The new College Sports Commission aims to enforce regulations on NIL deals, but skepticism remains about its effectiveness.
