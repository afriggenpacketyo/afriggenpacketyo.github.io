          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 01:01:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially implemented broad tariffs on goods from over 60 countries and the European Union, with rates ranging from 10% to 20%. Despite White House confidence that the move will spur domestic investment, early economic data indicates potential negative consequences, including stalled hiring and rising inflation since the initial tariff announcements in April. Many economists express concern that the new import taxes will not cause a sudden collapse but rather a slow erosion of the U.S. economy, as businesses and consumers brace for the impact of what critics call an unpredictable trade policy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has identified 37 young "de novo" genes, which are unique to humans and are not evolved from pre-existing genes. These novel genes are believed to be instrumental in developing advanced human traits, such as higher cognitive abilities. However, the research, published in Cell Genomics, also found a strong correlation between these genes and the growth of cancerous tumors. The study showed that the expression of these genes was significantly elevated in tumors, and suppressing some of them could inhibit cancer cell proliferation, suggesting these unique genetic building blocks may be a double-edged sword.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explores the significant global repercussions if China and India were to cease purchasing Russian oil, a scenario prompted by U.S. threats of secondary sanctions. Both nations have become critical buyers for Moscow since the Ukraine war began, with India saving an estimated $33 billion on energy costs due to discounted prices. A sudden removal of Russia's five million barrels per day from the market could trigger a seismic shock, potentially causing oil prices to surge and stoking global inflation. The article notes that while India faces direct tariff pressure, China's larger economic scale may give it more leverage to resist U.S. coercion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A roundup of UK newspaper headlines highlights several key political stories of the day. The Daily Telegraph focuses on what it calls "Labour's tax war," reporting that Keir Starmer has created uncertainty by not repeating a pledge to avoid raising major taxes. The Times covers an Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis suggesting council taxes may rise under a Labour plan to reallocate funding to deprived areas. Meanwhile, The Guardian reports on an open letter from scholars opposing the government's ban on the activist group Palestine Action, warning it could stifle debate and lead to arrests.</p>

The 48-year-old from New Jersey has been working in minor league baseball since 2016 and has participated in MLB spring training games for the past two years. Her historic debut follows in the footsteps of other female pioneers who broke officiating barriers in major men's professional sports leagues.

          <p>China's trade data for July revealed surprisingly strong growth, with exports increasing by 7.2% and imports rising by 4.1% compared to the previous year, both figures surpassing economists' expectations. The import growth marks the largest jump in a year, suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand, while robust exports continue to be a key pillar supporting the Chinese economy. This positive economic signal comes as a tariff truce with the United States approaches its expiration date. Despite the strong trade figures, other data indicates a slowdown in factory activity, presenting a mixed outlook for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute has identified the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as the most-stolen vehicle in the United States, with a theft rate 39 times higher than the national average for recent models. The analysis found that powerful, expensive vehicles and pickup trucks are common targets for thieves, who are often attracted to high-horsepower models. The Camaro's vulnerability is also linked to its on-board data port, which can be exploited by knowledgeable thieves to steal the vehicle easily. In contrast, electric and hybrid vehicles were among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages overnight.</p>

          <p>A new coffee-table book by famed fashion photographer Juergen Teller, titled "Auschwitz Birkenau," is facing sharp criticism for its approach to documenting the Nazi concentration camp. A review in The Guardian argues that the project is banal and contributes nothing new to the understanding of the Holocaust, calling it a detached and narcissistic vanity project. The reviewer criticizes the iPhone-shot photographs as unremarkable and points to a moment where Teller photographs pages in the victim memorial's "Book of Names" that list his own surname. The article questions the ethics of celebrity artists tackling such a sensitive subject without adding meaningful perspective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests that a government plan to overhaul council funding rules in England could lead to significant financial losses for boroughs in inner London. Some councils in the capital could see funding drop by up to 12% after accounting for inflation, while outer London and other urban areas like Nottingham and Slough are projected to benefit. The new system aims to better align funding with local service demands by redirecting funds to areas with more properties in lower council tax bands. Critics argue the changes are merely shifting financial strain between communities rather than addressing chronic underfunding. (not investment advice)</p>

She used the anecdote to illustrate her deep-seated aversion to rule-breaking, a principle she says has shaped her character and political outlook. Badenoch also discussed her upbringing in Nigeria, her return to the UK, and her views on the "poverty of low expectations" she encountered from some teachers toward Black children in the 1990s.

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, albeit brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl for a week of performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut, featured a savvy program blending the music of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho as the soloist. The review praises the orchestra's ability to handle the jazzy, swinging orchestrations of Ellington's work, a feat few classical orchestras can achieve. The homecoming was described as both joyous and bittersweet, as Dudamel's planned tour with his Venezuelan youth orchestra was canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the charity Rethink Mental Illness reveals a growing disparity in healthcare access in England, with patients waiting for mental health treatment facing significantly longer delays than those needing physical care. The data shows there are 12 times more patients waiting over 18 months for mental health services compared to physical health appointments. The article highlights the personal toll of these delays through the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has been stuck on waiting lists for years despite multiple crises. Experts warn that these long waits worsen patient outcomes and increase long-term costs for the NHS.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who has heavily criticized the company for its reliance on overseas production, particularly in China and India. This move is widely seen as an effort by Apple to mitigate the impact of threatened tariffs on its products, which rely on a complex global supply chain. The new investment aims to bring more component production to the U.S., a goal the president hailed as a step toward American-made iPhones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to levy an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, a move that would bring the total rate to 50%. This action is a direct response to India's continued purchasing of Russian oil, which the White House stated undermines U.S. efforts to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine. India's foreign ministry labeled the new tariff as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," noting that the U.S. had previously encouraged these imports to stabilize global energy markets. The tariff, set to take effect in late August, signals a significant escalation in trade pressure against a key partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to crack down on the unregulated cosmetic procedures industry by introducing a new licensing scheme for practitioners. Under the proposals, high-risk treatments like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals, while clinics offering Botox and dermal fillers will need a license to operate. The new rules also aim to protect minors from dangerous social media trends by implementing age restrictions on certain procedures. While the industry has welcomed the move for enhanced safety, the regulations will require further consultation and parliamentary approval before coming into force.</p>
