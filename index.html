This ambitious project, partially funded by a $5 million city bond, will feature concrete sculptures cast by international artists, designed to foster coral growth. Led by Colin Foord of Coral Morphologic and artistic director Ximena Caminos, the reef aims to become a living ecosystem and an accessible ecotourism attraction visible to snorkelers. The initiative seeks to renew the area's lost coral reefs and educate visitors on marine conservation.</p>

However, the National Park Service's former chief historian raised concerns about the lack of a rigorous review process for the significant addition.

          <p>Buckingham Palace is likely to face increasing questions regarding its prior knowledge and handling of Prince Andrew's scandal, particularly in light of new evidence from Jeffrey Epstein documents. While Andrew has stepped back as a working royal, the era under scrutiny was when he held official duties, raising questions about what royal and government officials knew. New emails and documents suggest Andrew's continued contact with Epstein and inquiries about Virginia Giuffre, despite his denials. This renewed scrutiny highlights changing expectations for transparency within the Royal Family and calls for further accountability.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that federal SNAP benefits for 5.5 million low-income Californians could be delayed starting November 1 if the federal government shutdown isn't resolved by Thursday. Newsom blamed President Trump for the potential disruption, especially with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, calling it an endangerment to lives. The White House, however, attributed the shutdown to Democrats. This potential cutoff affects federally funded CalFresh benefits, disproportionately impacting children and elderly people, prompting advocacy groups to urge the USDA to utilize contingency funding to prevent a "disastrous" food insecurity crisis.</p>

Prosecutors presented evidence including cell phone contact, a stolen vehicle used by King, and extensive video. King had previously been arrested for kidnapping and assault, but those charges were dropped.

The Met has launched a revised strategy targeting organized crime groups, which profit significantly from reselling stolen devices, particularly in China. Recent operations led to 18 arrests and 2,000 handset seizures, signaling a more serious approach to the crime. Victims report substantial financial losses beyond the device itself.</p>

          <p>Despite a seemingly friendly meeting between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Australia harbors growing doubts about the reliability of its long-standing alliance with the United States. Trump's "America First" policies, including tariffs and a review of the Aukus defense pact, have fueled distrust. While Albanese secured reaffirmation for Aukus and a critical minerals investment deal, polls show declining Australian confidence in the US under Trump. However, with rising tensions with China, many Australians still believe the alliance is more crucial than ever, balancing concerns with perceived necessity.</p>

          <p>UK Conservatives are criticizing the government's new sentencing bill, alleging it will lead to the early release of over 2,000 prisoners convicted of serious crimes like sexual assault, stalking, and grooming. They have tabled an amendment to prevent these offenders from benefiting from the proposed "earned progression scheme," which allows early release after serving a third of a sentence for good behavior. Labour, however, accused the Tories of "rank hypocrisy," blaming them for the current prison overcrowding crisis and asserting that the worst offenders would not qualify for early release. The debate highlights deep divisions over criminal justice reform.</p>

          <p>A senior ICE official, Marcos Charles, defended the agency's tactics following a controversial raid on the wrong home in Portland, Oregon, where non-criminal residents were detained. Gloria Magaña's family was subjected to a forced entry by armed agents looking for someone else, leading to the detention of her son and partner, both undocumented and without criminal records. Charles asserted ICE operations are not indiscriminate and agents use necessary force, maintaining a broad mandate for arrests under the Trump administration.

Pillar two focuses on sharing advanced military technologies like hypersonic missiles and AI. Despite an earlier review by the Trump administration, the deal is now confirmed "full steam ahead."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent rule change by the US Bureau of Industry and Security has significantly escalated US-China trade tensions by effectively expanding its "entity list" of sanctioned companies. While the US describes this as a technical loophole closure, experts like Arthur Kroeber of Gavekal argue its impact is far from technical, potentially affecting thousands of Chinese companies. This move, which restricts trade with firms deemed security threats, is seen as the true trigger for Beijing's subsequent expansion of rare earth export controls. The article clarifies the context and implications of this key development in the ongoing trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

The 82-year-old underwent treatment at the University of Pennsylvania’s Radiation Oncology clinic. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared an Instagram story showing him ringing a bell, a symbolic gesture for completing a phase of cancer treatment. This follows earlier surgery in September to remove skin cancer lesions. Concerns about Biden’s health were a factor in his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, but completing this treatment marks a significant step in his health journey.</p>

Drivers must be at least 18 with a valid license, and carts are restricted to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or lower, while the carts themselves are capped at 15 mph.

This success follows a watershed 2015 study showing early peanut introduction reduced allergy chances by over 80%.
