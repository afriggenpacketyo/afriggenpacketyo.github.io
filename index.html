          <p>At least 15 people are trapped following an industrial tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Fire Department has dispatched extensive resources, including all of its Urban Search and Rescue teams, to the scene. Communication with the trapped individuals has not been established, as the collapse, located up to six miles from the tunnel's only access point, appears to have damaged communication lines. Rescue operations are complex and ongoing as authorities work to reach the workers.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens, particularly women, about a recent surge in kidnappings. Analysts suggest Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception they carry large amounts of cash and operate outside formal banking systems. The embassy's advisory follows several incidents across the country and a fatal home invasion, highlighting the serious threat to the personal and property safety of Chinese nationals. Citizens are urged to avoid traveling alone and to take extra precautions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging the state's regulations on egg production have unlawfully inflated prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's rules, which mandate specific conditions for hen enclosures to prevent animal cruelty and foodborne diseases, create unnecessary red tape that violates federal law. The administration argues these state-level requirements cannot be imposed on eggs imported from other states, seeking to establish national uniformity in egg safety standards. This legal action is part of a broader effort to address rising food costs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, citing a national security assessment. The administration emphasized copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and other essential technologies, stating the tariff will help rebuild the domestic copper industry. The announcement caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, creating a wide premium over the global market. Analysts predict this move will lead to shortages and price increases in the short term as domestic production will take years to ramp up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo vessel, the Eternity C, in the Red Sea, resulting in at least three deaths and 19 missing crew members.

This incident follows the sinking of another vessel just days prior, escalating maritime insecurity in the crucial shipping lane. The attacks, which the Houthis claim are in support of Palestinians, have now sunk four ships and killed at least seven seafarers since November 2023.</p>

Oxfam argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems are exacerbating this disparity.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents in connection with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. The disciplinary actions, which include suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days, follow an independent review by the Department of Homeland Security. That report found that the agency had become "complacent" and was not performing at the elite levels required for its mission. The suspensions affect personnel from the supervisory to the line agent level, marking a significant official response to the security breakdowns that occurred during the attack.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was arrested while covering a protest in Georgia, remains in ICE custody despite being granted bond by an immigration judge. Guevara, founder of a Spanish-language news outlet, alleges he is being persecuted for his journalistic work and that authorities are making a concerted effort to keep him detained. His lawyer claims ICE challenged his release and put his bond on hold. In a public statement, Guevara called on El Salvador's president to intercede on his behalf, asserting he has no criminal record and should not be treated like a criminal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino has issued a decree allowing parishioners to miss Sunday Mass due to widespread fear of federal immigration sweeps. The bishop stated that the "fear constitutes a grave inconvenience" for the faithful, as the Trump administration's enforcement push has detained nearly 2,800 people in the L.A. area. This extraordinary measure reflects the profound impact immigration enforcement is having on community life, with some churches reporting attendance has dropped by up to half. The dispensation will remain in effect until the circumstances that prompted it are resolved.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully recovered since its significant drop during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the average lifespan remains nearly a year shorter than in 2019, with the state only regaining about two-thirds of the years lost. While COVID-19 was the primary driver of the decline, drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease are now the main factors preventing a full recovery. The study also highlights persistent disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians, as well as those in low-income areas, experiencing a slower and less complete rebound in life expectancy.</p>

          <p>A high-ranking Iranian official made a threatening remark about former President Donald Trump, suggesting he could be targeted by a drone. Mohammad-Javad Larijani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader, stated on Iranian television that Trump "can no longer sunbathe in Mar-a-Lago" because a small drone might strike him "in the navel." The comment was made during a discussion about Iran's military technology. The remark represents a pointed and imaginative threat from a figure within the Iranian regime, adding to the tense rhetoric between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, for her critical work regarding Israel's military actions in Gaza. U.S. officials accused Albanese of expressing support for terrorism and contempt for the U.S. and Israel. The move is part of a broader campaign against international bodies like the ICC that the administration views as biased. Albanese, who recently called on companies to stop doing business with Israel to avoid complicity in war crimes, described the sanctions as "mafia style intimidation techniques" intended to silence scrutiny.</p>

          <p>On the day he was due to report to prison, former Representative George Santos made a dubious claim that House Speaker Mike Johnson prevented President Trump from pardoning him. Santos, sentenced to seven years for wire fraud and identity theft, made the assertion on social media without providing any evidence. The claim was met with widespread skepticism, as the House Speaker has no formal power to block a presidential pardon. Before making the claim, Santos posted a message stating he was not suicidal, expressing fear about his safety as a gay man in federal custody.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 jobs at NASA, targeting high-ranking employees with specialized skills and management experience. According to documents obtained by Politico, the move is part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government through buyouts and early retirements. Most of the targeted staff work in core mission areas like science and human space flight, and their departure would deprive the agency of decades of institutional knowledge. The proposed cuts have been condemned by former NASA officials, who warn they threaten U.S. leadership in space exploration.</p>

EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic expressed hope for a satisfactory conclusion, taking advantage of a deadline extension to August 1.

This major escalation came just after President Trump criticized Vladimir Putin and pledged more weapons to Ukraine.
