          <p>Chicken thighs are gaining popularity in the U.S., challenging the long-standing dominance of chicken breasts. Once considered a cheaper and tastier alternative, boneless, skinless chicken thighs have seen a rise in price and are now featured prominently on menus at fast-casual restaurants. This shift is attributed to the increasing automation of thigh deboning, the diversification of the American palate, and the rise of fast-casual restaurants. The industry may need to start breeding birds with bigger thighs if demand continues to rise. Optimism score: 70</p>
