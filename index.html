          <p>Several news outlets are focusing on Donald Trump's statements regarding the conflict in Ukraine, specifically his assertion that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is hindering peace negotiations by refusing to concede Crimea to Russia. These comments have sparked debate and concern among international allies. Additionally, Chancellor Rachel Reeves' proposals to cut tariffs on US car imports are gaining attention, especially in light of upcoming meetings with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The potential tariff cuts are seen as a move to attract investors and strengthen trade relations between the UK and the US.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received preferential treatment in exchange for the airline CEO leading a state-funded agency. This indictment follows a series of prosecutions against officials from Moon's administration, reflecting a pattern of politicized investigations in South Korea. The Democratic Party has condemned the prosecution, claiming it is a politically motivated attempt to humiliate a former president, while the current government is led by acting president and prime minister Han Duck-soo.</p>

          <p>Chinese robot manufacturers are largely unaffected by US tariffs due to their dominance in specific sectors, such as automated cafes. Despite rising US duties, companies like Dolphin Robot Technology are maintaining prices because of limited international competition. This situation underscores how certain Chinese industries have established a strong foothold in the global market, allowing them to withstand the pressures of trade disputes.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a series of executive actions aimed at reshaping education policies, including efforts to rein in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in colleges and universities. One action targets college accreditors, alleging they have abused their authority by imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards. Another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools, aiming to base policies on objective behavior rather than DEI. These actions reflect Trump's conservative agenda and aim to roll back policies from the Biden administration, while also bolstering workforce training and improving AI education in schools.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his refusal to recognize Russian control over Crimea, accusing him of harming peace negotiations. Trump claimed that a deal to end the war was "very close" but that Zelensky's stance would prolong the conflict. This statement follows US Vice-President JD Vance's suggestion that a deal would involve freezing territorial lines close to their current positions, implying that both Ukraine and Russia would need to make territorial concessions. Trump's comments hint at a potential shift in US policy towards recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, which would be a significant departure from international norms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has been steadily declining during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times average of polling.

While it is typical for presidents to experience a decline in approval over time, Trump's approval has been dropping slightly faster than that of his predecessors.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that he could re-impose "reciprocal" tariffs on some countries within weeks, potentially escalating the global trade war. Despite a temporary pause on reciprocal tariffs, Trump has stated that if deals are not reached, tariffs could be set as high as 50%, except for China, where they could reach 145%. This back-and-forth stance on tariffs has created uncertainty for businesses and consumers, shaking markets and raising fears of a recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that the trade war with China is unsustainable and expects de-escalation in the near future.</p>

Assembly Bill 942, proposed by a former Edison executive, would limit credits to 10 years and end incentives upon the sale of the house. Supporters argue it will alleviate the financial burden on non-solar ratepayers, while opponents contend it will undermine the state's commitment to renewable energy and harm those who invested in solar panels based on the promise of long-term incentives.</p>
