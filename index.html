            <h2>US Vehicle Supply Dwindles Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

            <p>New and used vehicle supplies in the U.S. are decreasing as consumers rush to buy cars and trucks ahead of potential tariff-related price increases. According to Cox Automotive, the days' supply of new vehicles has significantly dropped, with used vehicle supply also declining. This surge in sales, while beneficial for the automotive industry in the short term, raises concerns about a potential halt once tariff-free inventories are depleted. Telemetry anticipates a substantial decrease in annual vehicle sales in the U.S. and Canada due to rising production costs and associated price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

The ECB's series of rate cuts comes as inflation in the euro area approaches the central bank's 2% target, while regional economic growth remains lackluster.
