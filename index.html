          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., which aims to acquire the company. Trump emphasized that the deal involves investment and partial ownership, but control will stay in the United States, adding that the two companies are set to sign a partnership that will create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the economy. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have welcomed Trump's decision, indicating that the bulk of Nippon Steel's investment will occur over the next 14 months, solidifying American control and securing the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>

Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that Zelenskyy is not helping his country by speaking out, adding that everything Zelenskyy says causes problems. The attacks involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has delayed his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US until July 9, following a "very nice call" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen announced the tariff delay on social media, stating that Europe is ready to move ahead with trade talks "swiftly and decisively," providing more time for both sides to negotiate. The decision marks a reversal from Trump's earlier warning that he would impose the tariffs on June 1 due to stalled discussions with the EU. Other news includes Trump warning of Russiaâ€™s â€˜downfallâ€™ if it tries to seize all of Ukraine, and US federal judges considering creating their own armed security force as threats mount.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The increase in detections is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems, which rely on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. Boosting and member fraud account for the majority of fake reviews, while paid reviews, originating mostly from Asia, are considered more pernicious. Tripadvisor employs AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalizes violators, highlighting the ongoing "cat and mouse" game in rooting out fake reviews.</p>

Xu highlights China's shrinking population, falling savings and production rates, and other economic headwinds as reasons for the adjustment. He emphasized that achieving 4% annual GDP growth would be positive if employment expands and the debt ratio is controlled, and that setting a target higher than the potential growth would be inappropriate given international and domestic difficulties.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, suggests that Beijing could subdue Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure nodes, leading to a "system collapse" that would undermine the island's resistance. The article identifies 30 to 40 "super critical" targets, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, which, if attacked, could disrupt electricity, water supplies, and communication networks. The tactic, termed "urban collapse warfare," aims to achieve maximum effect with minimal military cost, potentially leading to a "win without fighting," and the article highlights Taiwan's dependence on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters as factors making it a suitable target.</p>

          <p>HS2 Ltd is investigating allegations regarding the practices of some labor suppliers to the project, specifically focusing on two firms supplying workers for the West Midlands section of the high-speed rail line. The investigation, which began earlier this year, relates to the misclassification of staff and claims that inflated rates were being charged for them, and HS2 Ltd is treating all whistleblower allegations seriously, with Balfour Beatty Vinci implementing additional monitoring and controls. The Department for Transport has stated that any claims of wrongdoing in HS2's supply chain will be thoroughly investigated, and one of the labor suppliers remains suspended from new contracts during the inquiries.</p>
