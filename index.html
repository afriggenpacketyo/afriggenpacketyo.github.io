          <p>Renk, a German defense company specializing in tank gearboxes, is targeting talent from the struggling automotive industry to meet growing demand driven by increased military spending and geopolitical tensions. The company's stock has surged, and its order book has jumped significantly, prompting collaboration with the automotive sector, which faces challenges due to a sluggish economy and international competition. Renk's CEO and COO, both with automotive industry experience, are capitalizing on this trend by hiring engineers who can bring continuous improvement and efficiency principles to the defense sector. IG Metall, Germany's largest trade union, acknowledges the potential for job creation but cautions against a one-sided focus on rearmament. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition party in parliament, reflecting a broader trend of far-right gains in Europe. The party secured the second-most seats in parliament, marking a significant shift in Portuguese politics, where center-right and center-left parties have traditionally dominated. Chega's rise coincides with similar gains by far-right forces in France, Italy, and Germany, fueled by hardline stances against immigration and the inability of traditional parties to form lasting governments. The party's leader, Andre Ventura, hailed this as a profound change in the Portuguese political system.</p>

Police believe workers accidentally drilled into the cylinder, causing the acetylene gas inside to ignite.

          <p>The article examines the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind their decision to serve in an army involved in what the author describes as apartheid. The author draws parallels to the pied-noirs in Frederick Forsyth's novel, The Day of the Jackal, suggesting that these individuals may feel more connected to Israel than to their own country. The article highlights the role of Zionist summer camps and other social apparatuses in radicalizing young Americans, leading them to participate in war crimes. It contrasts this with the scrutiny faced by Muslims and discusses the establishment's affinity for Israel as a factor in the lack of attention given to this radicalization.</p>

Manager Ron Washington employed unconventional strategies, including intentionally walking Aaron Judge twice in the first two innings, but the team's inability to generate runs proved decisive.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The world's largest automaker also saw a 7.8% increase in global production, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so if the higher tariffs remain long-term.

The ruling, which the Trump administration is appealing, potentially undermines the president's economic agenda and trade negotiations. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling does not affect tariffs on specific products like aluminum and steel, as they were not justified under IEEPA powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is soliciting early retirement applications in the United States as part of its ongoing efforts to improve its financial situation. The program, targeting employees in administrative departments and vehicle assembly plants, is part of a broader streamlining effort that includes cutting 20,000 jobs and closing seven vehicle plants globally. The company aims to reduce its workforce in the U.S., where it has struggled with sales due to a limited hybrid model lineup. Nissan will also solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff in Japan this summer.</p>

          <p>California avocado growers report that Mexican imports have bolstered their sales by ensuring a year-round supply, which has increased overall demand for avocados. Despite initial concerns that Mexican avocados would hurt local production, the steady influx has transformed avocados from specialty items to mainstream staples. This has allowed growers like Andreas Tompros, who is replanting his orchard after a wildfire, to remain optimistic about the industry's future. The Hass Avocado Board's marketing efforts, funded by both domestic and import fees, have also played a significant role in the fruit's booming popularity.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to rising concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This move reflects Britain's increasingly critical stance toward Israel's conduct in the war. However, the recent deadly shooting of Israeli embassy employees in Washington has prompted some British officials to reconsider the timing of such sanctions. Britain is likely to wait and see if Israel allows increased aid to Gaza before making a decision.

The Slovak government had previously denied discriminatory treatment but has since introduced reforms, including a legal definition of segregation.
