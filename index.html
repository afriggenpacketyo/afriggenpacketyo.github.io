        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut Nvidia GPU usage by 82% for its AI models. Beta-tested for over three months, the system reduced the need for H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 to serve dozens of models. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in serving concurrent large language model (LLM) workloads, where many GPUs are often underutilized. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented these findings, highlighting Aegaeon as a pioneering effort in optimizing AI inference costs on the market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that prosecutors must begin a retrial for Pedro Hernandez, convicted in the 1979 kidnapping and murder of Etan Patz, by June 1, 2026. Failure to start jury selection by this date will result in Hernandez's release, with the judge also suggesting bail could be granted prior to any new trial. This marks Hernandez's potential third trial, following a hung jury in 2015 and a guilty verdict in 2017 that was later overturned due to incorrect jury instructions. The case concerns the decades-old disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz, whose body was never recovered.</p>

          <p>At least 15 individuals were detained following confrontations between Illinois state police and protesters outside the Broadview ICE detention center in Chicago. Tensions escalated when officers cleared roadways after demonstrators reportedly ignored designated protest zones, leading to physical altercations captured on video. This incident follows weeks of unrest at the facility, with federal agents previously using chemical agents on crowds. The mayor of Broadview has criticized federal conduct and reduced protest areas, while a recent court order now requires federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he has commuted the prison sentence of former Republican congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release. Santos, who was less than three months into a seven-year sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, was described by Trump as 'somewhat of a 'rogue'' but praised for his consistent Republican voting. Trump cited Santos' alleged mistreatment and solitary confinement as reasons for the commutation. This decision follows a public plea from Santos to the president and calls for his release from Republican allies.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, 'Silent Honour,' has inspired a surge of public appreciation for real-life intelligence agents, particularly a historical figure named Wu. Visitors have flocked to Wu's tomb, laying flowers and thank-you notes, despite it not being a traditional grave-sweeping festival. Wu, an underground Communist Party member, served as a Kuomintang lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949, and is now being hailed as an 'unsung hero.' This outpouring of sentiment reflects the drama's impact on public perception of historical espionage and patriotism in China.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman has intensified his involvement in the New York City mayoral race, asserting that Republican Curtis Sliwa's continued candidacy boosts democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory chances to 90%. Ackman, who supports independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, argued that Sliwa's refusal to drop out is detrimental to Cuomo's prospects. Sliwa's campaign, however, rejected Ackman's influence, insisting that voters, not billionaires, will decide the outcome. The race, also featuring Mamdani and Cuomo, has garnered national attention and significant trading volume on prediction markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ambition to be a peacemaking president sees mixed results, with a fragile cease-fire in Gaza achieved through maximum pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. However, his efforts in Ukraine appear stalled, as he declined to authorize Tomahawk missiles for Kyiv after a surprise call with Russian President Putin. Putin offered trade deals and another summit in Budapest, which would exclude Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, effectively buying Russia more time in the conflict.

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the US Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, intensifying a legal battle with Democratic-led cities.

The Justice Department argues that federal agents in Chicago and Broadview face threats and assaults, necessitating the troops to protect federal property and officers.

          <p>India's jewellery market is bustling ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras, traditional festivals for buying precious metals, despite gold prices topping $1,440 per 10g. Soaring prices have led to a shift in consumer behavior, with many buying smaller, lighter jewellery pieces or prioritizing gold and silver for investment rather than adornment. Bullion market data and reports from the World Gold Council indicate a steady increase in investment demand, including through ETFs and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also significantly influencing prices by diversifying its foreign exchange holdings with gold, aiming for stability amidst geopolitical stress.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a remarkable turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This significant decline is attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdose fatalities are down by 35%. Key initiatives include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, widespread access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone, and the availability of naloxone to reverse overdoses. The article highlights a generational shift away from opioids among young people and the impact of the $60 billion Opioid Settlement funding prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:26:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The North Pacific Ocean recorded its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures between July and September exceeding the previous high by over 0.25C across an area ten times the Mediterranean's size. This 'warm blob' has climate scientists puzzled, as temperatures are higher than most climate models predicted, despite global warming making marine heatwaves more likely. Natural variability, like weaker winds, plays a role, but scientists suggest a recent change in shipping fuels, reducing Sun-reflecting aerosols, might be a primary contributor. This phenomenon has already impacted weather in Japan, South Korea, and the US, and could potentially lead to a colder early winter in the UK.</p>

          <p>Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a leading proxy advisor, is recommending that Tesla shareholders vote against a proposed pay package for CEO Elon Musk that could grant him nearly $1 trillion in stock. While acknowledging the plan's potential for significant shareholder value, ISS expressed concerns over the 'astronomical grant value' and design of the 'mega performance equity award.' Tesla, however, criticized ISS for allegedly misunderstanding investment and governance fundamentals, urging shareholders to support the board's recommendations. This article notes that Musk, who holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, will be able to vote his own shares on the plan.</p>

This follows a historic $4 billion settlement approved earlier this year for about 11,000 claimants, with thousands more cases still unresolved. The settlements stem from a 2020 California law suspending the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse victims. Authorities are investigating allegations of fraudulent claims, and the county is implementing new safeguards, including a hotline for reporting child sexual abuse. Officials emphasize the severe financial strain these settlements place on county services.</p>
