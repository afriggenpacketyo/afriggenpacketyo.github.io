          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 01:04:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Donald Trump sent a vulgar birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, featuring a drawing of a naked woman. The report, based on a collection of letters compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, prompted a swift denial from Trump, who called the story "fake" and vowed to sue the newspaper and its owner. This development adds another layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the president's connections to Epstein and the public demand for the release of related government files. The incident has drawn further attention from figures like Elon Musk and supporters who want more transparency.</p>

          <h2>House Passes $9 Billion in Spending Cuts for Foreign Aid and Public Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:50:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly approved a $9 billion spending reduction package requested by President Trump, targeting foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. The bill passed on a near party-line vote after overcoming procedural delays related to Democrats' demands for a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related files. The legislation eliminates funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS, and cuts about $8 billion from foreign assistance programs like USAID. The measure, which now heads to the president's desk, was celebrated by Trump as a significant victory.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are focused on the government's plan to lower the voting age to 16, a move hailed as a historic reform by some but criticized by opponents as an attempt to "rig the political system." Polling suggests that fewer than one in five young people would definitely vote if an election were held tomorrow. In other news, the Labour Party has suspended MP Diane Abbott over her comments on racism, signaling a tougher stance on party discipline under Keir Starmer. Additionally, facial recognition technology will be deployed at the Notting Hill Carnival, raising civil liberties concerns.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in funds, a move that entirely cuts federal support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and slashes foreign aid. This decision eliminates the $1.1 billion that funds NPR, PBS, and their member stations for the next two years, prompting warnings of station closures, particularly in rural areas. NPR's CEO called the cut an "irreversible loss" that dismantles vital local institutions, while supporters of the cut have long criticized public media for perceived political bias. The bill now awaits President Trump's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump linked the tariffs to the demand that legal charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro be dropped, an action Lula described as an attack on Brazil's national sovereignty. Lula labeled Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance as "traitors" but also emphasized a desire for a good relationship with the US. The diplomatic clash comes as Trump expressed public sympathy for Bolsonaro, escalating tensions between the two nations' leaders.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood belief that adults have everything figured out. Instead, he has learned that most people are "winging it" through a life that is a constant state of becoming. He draws parallels to the French comedy show "Bref," which he first watched as a young immigrant in France and whose recent sequel explores the deeper themes of middle age. The author contemplates the complexities of identity, regret, and finding meaning while living in a world facing immense political and environmental challenges.</p>

The host, who has helmed the top-rated late-night program since 2015, told a surprised audience that the show is not being replaced and will simply be going away. While the network stated the cancellation is a financial decision unrelated to the show's content, the timing has raised skepticism. The announcement follows Colbert's recent criticism of parent company Paramount Global and comes as the company seeks federal approval for a major merger.</p>

          <p>Amid growing pressure over the Jeffrey Epstein case, President Trump announced he has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury transcripts. This move came shortly after a Wall Street Journal report alleged Trump sent a "bawdy" letter to Epstein in 2003, a claim the president denies. While Bondi stated her readiness to petition the court, legal experts note that releasing such transcripts is rare and may not satisfy critics demanding full transparency. These critics argue that other evidence, like FBI interviews and recordings, would be more revealing than testimony related to Epstein's indictment.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite the moderation, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, and underlying "core-core" inflation actually ticked up slightly. Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs create uncertainty for the economic outlook.

The article suggests the move may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump by the network's parent company, Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for a merger. It highlights recent events, including a $16 million settlement with Trump over a lawsuit and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes," as evidence of the network prioritizing the deal over its journalistic and editorial independence.

The announcement addresses public speculation about the president's health, which was fueled by images of swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter being attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed that Trump "remains in excellent health."</p>

          <h2>California Sues Trump Administration Over Cancellation of High-Speed Rail Funding</h2>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The suit, filed by the state's attorney general, calls the decision "arbitrary and capricious" and alleges it is a political stunt driven by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom stated the move is a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs. The administration cited significant budget shortfalls and missed deadlines as the reason for pulling the funds from America's only high-speed rail line currently under construction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the ongoing friction between its chair, Jerome Powell, and President Donald Trump. The Fed operates independently to manage the nation's money supply, aiming for low unemployment and stable prices, often by adjusting interest rates. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for keeping interest rates relatively high, a move intended to fight inflation, and has reportedly discussed the legally untested idea of firing him. While the president can express displeasure, federal law protects the Fed chair from being removed without cause, a safeguard for the central bank's political independence.

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento, an action seen as a direct challenge to California's sanctuary laws. The chief of the El Centro sector recorded a video in front of the state capitol, declaring "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation, which resulted in 11 arrests, was condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as "illegal racial profiling." The enforcement action took place despite a recent federal court order blocking agents from using racial profiling for warrantless arrests in the region.</p>

          <p>The FDA has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market, reversing a 2022 order to remove them. Regulators concluded that the company's studies demonstrate its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. The decision makes Juul one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol vapes, a flavor popular with adults. The move is expected to face strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups who blame Juul for sparking the teen vaping epidemic.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna clarified that his department has "no choice" but to honor federal judicial warrants from ICE seeking the transfer of inmates. He distinguished these legally binding warrants, which are for criminal charges, from civil immigration detainers, which the department does not honor under sanctuary policies. Luna reassured the community that his department does not assist ICE with street-level enforcement operations, which have caused fear in immigrant communities. The statement comes amid heightened tensions over federal immigration enforcement in California and a DOJ request for lists of non-citizen inmates.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch from high-fructose corn syrup to "REAL Cane Sugar." The article argues the move is a political gesture to appeal to his base and figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., rather than a meaningful public health victory. Health experts note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects, making the change largely superficial. The piece frames the announcement as part of a pattern where the administration scores headlines by pressuring companies on ingredients, distracting from the larger health issues associated with products like sugary sodas.

          <p>A university in Dalian, China, has expelled a female student for "damaging national dignity" after she was accused of having "improper interactions" with a foreign man. The decision has sparked a significant backlash on Chinese social media, with many users questioning the university's right to police her private life and labeling the action as nationalistic and misogynistic. The incident is reportedly linked to videos posted online by a Ukrainian professional gamer showing him with an Asian woman. The university's action highlights growing tensions in China around issues of gender bias, personal freedom, and nationalism.</p>
