          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a significant legislative package, described by proponents as the "big, beautiful bill," which encompasses key elements of the Trump administration's agenda, including spending priorities and tax cuts. House Speaker Mike Johnson championed the bill, framing it as a fulfillment of promises to the American people and contrasting Republican "results" with Democratic "performances." The vote followed a record-breaking speech by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who spoke in opposition to the legislation. The bill is now expected to move forward, with the president reportedly ready to sign it into law.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee man, Edward Kelley, who received a presidential pardon for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison on separate federal charges. The new conviction stems from a plot to incite a "civil war" by targeting and creating a "kill list" of federal law enforcement agents who were investigating him. Prosecutors argued that Kelley was remorseless and posed an ongoing threat, viewing the FBI as an enemy. This case highlights that a presidential pardon for one federal crime does not extend to other, unrelated federal offenses.</p>

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India has established a commanding position over England, largely due to a monumental innings from captain Shubman Gill, who scored 269 runs. His performance anchored India's first-innings total to a massive 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of day two, facing a significant deficit. With India's bowlers finding more movement than their English counterparts, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the series.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to borrow $150,000 against their home equity face a choice between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar initial monthly payments. However, the key difference lies in the rate structure; a HELOC's rate can fluctuate with market conditions, potentially making payments cheaper or more expensive over time, while a home equity loan's rate remains constant. Borrowers should carefully consider their risk tolerance for changing payments when deciding which option is more suitable for their financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

This private admission contrasts with China's public stance of neutrality.

          <p>With average credit card debt rising, many consumers are inadvertently making their financial situations worse through common mistakes. This article highlights five key errors, including making only minimum payments, which can prolong debt for decades and accrue thousands in extra interest. Other costly habits are ignoring the expiration of promotional 0% APR periods, using high-fee cash advances, and closing old credit cards, which can harm one's credit score. Falling even slightly behind on payments can trigger steep penalty rates, significantly increasing the overall cost of borrowing and making it harder to escape the debt cycle.

Furthermore, just over half of those surveyed are in favor of raising the legal purchasing age for beer and wine from 16 to 18.

          <p>The U.S. stock market started the second half of the year on a high note, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new all-time highs in a holiday-shortened trading week. The tech sector was the primary driver of this growth, with Nvidia's market capitalization surging past $3.9 trillion. This performance marks a strong recovery from volatility earlier in the year. A better-than-expected June jobs report indicated economic resilience, though it may temper arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The market gains occurred amid political developments, including progress on a major spending bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four prominent law enforcement associations have written to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to express serious concerns about the planned 75% staff reduction in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A).

They argue that I&A is a vital conduit for real-time threat information necessary to protect communities.

Key obstacles remain, including Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights and the significant domestic opposition within Lebanon.

          <p>As part of a massive network reconfiguration that includes closing 73 facilities and cutting 20,000 jobs, UPS is offering voluntary buyout packages to its full-time U.S. drivers. The move is part of the company's plan to adapt to reduced delivery volumes and other market pressures. The Teamsters union, which represents about 330,000 UPS workers, has condemned the buyouts, calling them an "illegal violation" of their national contract, which included a commitment from UPS to create thousands of new jobs. UPS has stated its intention to adhere to the contract terms.</p>

          <h2>Kentucky Reports New Measles Cases as National Outbreak Worsens Amid Anti-Vaccine Sentiment</h2>

          <p>As Kentucky confirms new measles cases, the U.S. faces its worst outbreak of the century, with over 1,200 infections nationwide. Public health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly eradicated disease to a decline in vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. The article notes that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of promoting such theories, has not strongly endorsed the proven MMR vaccine to combat the spread. Instead, he has questioned its safety testing and focused on unproven treatments, a stance that critics argue undermines public health efforts during a growing crisis.</p>

          <h2>Ryanair to Increase Free Cabin Bag Size by 20% in Line with New EU Standard</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 12:32:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Budget airline Ryanair has announced it will increase the size of the free "personal bag" passengers can bring on board by 20 percent. The new maximum dimensions will be 40cm x 30cm x 20cm, which is more generous than the new minimum standard being introduced by the European Union. The EU has been working with airlines to standardize carry-on sizes to reduce confusion and unexpected fees for travelers. The change, which will be implemented in the coming weeks, brings Ryanair's allowance closer to that of rivals like Easyjet and Wizz Air.</p>
