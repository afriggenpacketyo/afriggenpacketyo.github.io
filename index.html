          <h2>Pakistan Grapples with AI Advancement Amid Proliferation of Low-Quality Content</h2>

          <p>A recent report places Pakistan eighth in AI readiness in its region, trailing neighbors like India and Sri Lanka. While the country drafted a national AI policy in 2021, experts criticize it for lacking comprehensive strategies and sufficient investment in education and upskilling. This regulatory gap has contributed to a surge in "AI slop," low-quality and often deceptive content, which poses risks of misinformation and polarization. Despite these challenges, some entrepreneurs are finding economic opportunities using AI tools, highlighting the dual nature of the technology's impact in the nation.</p>

          <p>Both Russia and Ukraine have intensified their long-range drone strikes, reaching near-record levels of daily attacks as potential ceasefire talks are being considered. Ukraine reported intercepting a massive wave of Russian drones and missiles, though strikes still caused casualties and damage in Kyiv and other regions. In response, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has ordered an expansion of his country's drone capabilities to target Russian military production sites. The escalation occurs as both sides express a potential willingness to engage in negotiations, though significant obstacles clearly remain.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited a Customs and Border Protection officer who was shot and wounded during an attempted robbery in Manhattan. The off-duty officer was allegedly attacked by two individuals, one of whom was a previously deported Dominican national who was also injured in the exchange of gunfire and later arrested. The incident has drawn attention from political figures, including President Trump, who commented on the suspect's immigration status. A manhunt is currently underway for the second suspect involved in the attack.</p>

          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at an unprecedented depth. This type of sandstone-hosted deposit is considered more economically viable and easier to mine compared to other sources like granite. The discovery highlights China's advancements in deep-earth resource exploration technology. This development is crucial for the country, which is heavily reliant on uranium imports to fuel its expanding nuclear power sector and maintain its strategic nuclear program.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury firm, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become a major public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike simple buy-and-hold strategies, the company plans to differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security. Backed by prominent crypto investors, the firm argues that staking makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin. This launch comes as institutional interest in ether grows, partly due to recent regulatory clarity in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that Taiwanese firms are bracing for the impact of U.S. tariffs, with at least a quarter of companies putting expansion plans on hold. The report, conducted by two opposition-aligned think tanks, also found that 5% of the surveyed firms have already begun to cut staff. More than half of the Taiwanese companies with trade connections to the United States anticipate being negatively affected by the new tariffs. The findings highlight the tangible economic consequences of the trade policy on the island's business sector and its workforce.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight pilot performed what he described to passengers as an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military bomber while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot stated that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar at the airport, had not warned him about the military aircraft on a converging course. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover at the time of the incident. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the near-miss event to determine what happened.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is being used to house asylum seekers, escalated into violence, leading to six arrests. Demonstrators threw bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles during the gathering of over 1,000 people. The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker on suspicion of sexual assault in the town. A senior police official condemned the escalation into "mindless thuggery," and authorities implemented a dispersal order to prevent further disorder. The Prime Minister's office has called the scenes of attacks on police "clearly unacceptable."</p>

The company raised concerns about the impartiality of the investigation, pointing to the alleged involvement of researchers with a demonstrated hostility towards the platform.

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense success of global emergency vaccine stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis, finding they have averted an estimated 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths over two decades. These reserves allow for rapid deployment of vaccines during outbreaks, which is critical as manufacturing can take many months. However, this validation of their effectiveness comes at a precarious time, as global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low. Organizations like Gavi, which funds the stockpiles, are facing significant budget shortfalls, raising concerns about the future of these life-saving programs.</p>

The team dropped the name, long considered offensive to Native Americans, in 2020.

          <p>Microsoft has released an emergency security patch to address a critical zero-day vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint server software. The flaw was actively being exploited by hackers in widespread attacks targeting thousands of organizations globally, including businesses, universities, and government agencies. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain persistent, unauthenticated access, potentially leading to data theft, password harvesting, and full system takeovers.
