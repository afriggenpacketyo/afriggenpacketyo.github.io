            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has hit its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism following Trump's reelection, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express strong disapproval, particularly regarding tariffs and inflation, which are viewed as detrimental to the economy.</p>

Ukraine's President Zelensky claimed that Russian forces were still attempting to advance despite the ceasefire, while Russia's defense ministry accused Ukraine of violations.

            <p>China's domestically developed C909 passenger jet has expanded its presence in Southeast Asia, with VietJet commencing commercial operations with two of the aircraft. This makes Vietnam the third Southeast Asian country to utilize the C909, following Indonesia and Laos. The jets, leased from Chengdu Airlines, will operate on domestic routes within Vietnam, boosting fleet capacity and supporting the growth of the country's air transport market. This expansion comes after Vietnamese regulatory reforms allowing airlines to import aircraft certified by various countries, including China.</p>

            <p>This article examines how Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dismantled democracy in Hungary, offering potential lessons for aspiring autocrats. Orban targeted the media, universities, and civil society organizations, consolidating power within his Fidesz party. The article also draws parallels between Orban's strategies and President Trump's actions, suggesting a "constitutional coup" where institutions capable of checking power are rapidly undermined. The author notes that Hungary serves as a conservative fantasyland for MAGA Republicans, promoting family values and rejecting woke issues.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more active role in addressing the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, particularly due to its mining interests in the region. Beijing has directly called on Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This shift from China's usual non-interference policy is driven by the need to protect its mining investments and maintain relationships with both countries involved in the conflict.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to the US for packages valued over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of President Trump's new tariff regime.

Additionally, the White House is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without duties, impacting companies like Shein and Temu, who have warned of potential price increases.</p>
