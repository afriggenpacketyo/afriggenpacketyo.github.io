          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stated that "the state of our democracy" is a primary concern that keeps her awake at night. Speaking at an event, she emphasized the importance of public engagement with governmental affairs. Jackson, who has become a prominent critic of the Trump administration from the bench, defended her frequent and forceful dissents as a way to voice her perspective on critical issues. She also referenced her concern over the court's decision granting former President Trump immunity for official acts, suggesting it creates a different standard of justice for one individual.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and permanent U.S. resident, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. He was detained for over 100 days due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian campus protests, an action the government argued was detrimental to foreign policy interests. A federal judge ordered his release in June, finding he was not a flight risk or threat. Khalil is seeking either the monetary damages or an official apology for the harm caused by his detention, which prevented him from being present for the birth of his first child.</p>

          <p>Patty Hartman, a 17-year veteran of the Justice Department's public affairs team, has warned that the agency is "driving straight into an abyss" after being fired. She is one of several employees connected to the January 6th prosecutions who have been recently terminated, which she characterizes as retribution from the Trump administration. Hartman claims the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has been eliminated and that rules are being discarded. She is considering legal action over her dismissal, which she says is part of a broader destabilization within the government.</p>

This means that even small increments of planetary warming can lead to significantly longer and more dangerous periods of extreme heat. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, warns that this acceleration poses a severe threat to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly in tropical regions. The researchers stress the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies but express concern that funding cuts to climate science under the Trump administration could impede these efforts.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits" to legally bar access for these children.

          <p>Workers across China are facing growing economic anxiety as companies contend with insufficient production orders, leading to layoffs and significant pay cuts. The article profiles a corporate director at a chemical company who, despite keeping his job, had his salary reduced to a level that is no longer sufficient to support his family. He notes that finding a new, comparable job is much more difficult now than it was just two years ago. This personal story reflects a broader trend of economic unease and precarious employment affecting both white-collar and blue-collar workers throughout the country's manufacturing and corporate sectors.

          <p>The UK and France have agreed to a "ground-breaking" pilot scheme to return some migrants who arrive in the UK via small boats back to France. Under the "one in, one out" deal, the UK will in exchange accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers currently in France. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, said the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers by showing that the dangerous channel crossings will be "in vain." While details are still emerging, the scheme represents a new bilateral tactic to address the record numbers of illegal crossings.</p>

          <p>In response to students' growing fears over recent immigration enforcement actions in the Los Angeles area, Cal State L.A. has authorized professors to move classes online temporarily. The university provost acknowledged that many students, particularly on the large commuter campus, are "scared to take public transit and fearful of driving to campus." The policy also allows for excused absences and alternative assignments for those affected. This measure highlights the tangible impact of federal immigration raids on the daily lives and education of students in communities with large immigrant populations, creating disruption and anxiety within the academic environment.</p>

          <p>Walmart is recalling approximately 850,000 Ozark Trail stainless steel water bottles due to a severe safety hazard with the lid. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the lid can forcefully eject upon opening, posing serious impact and laceration risks. The defect has already caused two incidents of permanent vision loss and another injury. The 64-ounce bottles, which sold for about $15, were available exclusively at Walmart stores and online. Consumers are urged to stop using the product immediately and can return it to any Walmart for a full refund.</p>

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and was later returned to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges. A judge had ordered him released, but the government stated it would then begin removal proceedings to a third country.

          <p>The premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew, has accused a group of U.S. lawmakers of "trying to trivialise" a deadly wildfire season after they sent a letter complaining that smoke was disrupting Americans' summer. Kinew's province has declared a state of emergency as over 100 fires burn, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes. He contrasted the lawmakers' "ambulance chasing" with the actions of American firefighters who are on the ground helping battle the blazes. The incident highlights the cross-border tensions arising from Canada's historic wildfire season, which scientists link to the intensifying effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>After promising to release a secret "client list" from the Jeffrey Epstein case, the Trump administration has reversed course, with the FBI stating no such list exists and no further files will be released. This has caused a schism in MAGA world, with many longtime supporters and influencers feeling betrayed and accusing the administration of a cover-up. The reversal has forced conspiracy theories to mutate, with some now suggesting Trump's own officials are part of the "deep state."

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round led by Natural Capital and Shrug Capital. The company's mission is based on the principle that certain drugs crystallize more effectively in microgravity, potentially enabling the creation of medicines that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of its space flights and expand its biologics lab. Varda has already successfully launched three missions and returned its first capsule, marking a significant step toward establishing an orbital economy.</p>

          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. are at their highest point in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute the rise to record-high tick populations and a longer active season, which now extends into the winter due to climate change. Ticks can transmit numerous diseases, including Lyme disease, making the increase a significant public health concern. Health officials emphasize prevention strategies, such as wearing long sleeves, using insect repellent, and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors, as the most critical measures for protection.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, were scheduled to begin developing a new, centralized flood monitoring system this month, following years of unsuccessful attempts to fund such a project. The dashboard was intended as a decision-support tool for emergency managers, not a public alert system. This context is critical following the catastrophic July 4th flood, where the Guadalupe River rose rapidly, killing at least 96 people in the county. The lack of a robust, pre-existing warning system in the region, nicknamed "flash flood alley," is now under scrutiny as the community grapples with the devastating consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is compelling former aides to Joe Biden to provide "unrestricted testimony" to a House GOP investigation into Biden's health by waiving claims of executive privilege. This move forces the aides to choose between disclosing sensitive conversations or facing contempt of Congress. The tactic is a direct reversal of Trump's own position during the Jan. 6 investigation, when he warned that such waivers would do "grave damage" to the presidency by creating a cycle of political retribution. Constitutional experts now worry this action will further erode presidential norms and discourage candid advice within future administrations.</p>
