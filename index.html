          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests the euro could gain prominence as a global currency due to geopolitical shifts and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. dollar. Lagarde outlined three foundations for the euro to achieve greater global influence: a solid geopolitical foundation through open trade and security capabilities, a reinforced economic foundation to attract global capital, and a bolstered legal foundation by defending the rule of law. Nomura's George Buckley notes growing investor interest in diversifying away from the dollar, making the euro an attractive alternative due to the EU's large trading bloc. The euro has already gained against the dollar this year, and Buckley anticipates further gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts despite global economic uncertainties. Strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports have helped cushion the impact of trade policies. The Reserve Bank of India has been cutting interest rates to bolster growth, and is expected to cut rates again in June. The International Monetary Fund projects India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's in 2025, becoming the world's fourth-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant to have children, noting the record low fertility rate in the U.S. Factors include financial burdens, climate change concerns, career aspirations, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The author suggests that a redefinition of "harm" and "abuse" has led to impossibly high standards for parenting, with adult children expecting parents to ensure their career success and mental well-being. This cultural shift contributes to a reluctance to become parents.</p>

His presence in the White House also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, given his companies' business dealings with the government.

          <p>The implementation of Measure G, approved by Los Angeles County voters, is set to begin with the creation of the Governance Reform Task Force, promising to transform county governance. The measure aims to expand the Board of Supervisors and establish an elected county executive to provide checks and balances. Proponents argue that the reforms are needed to address challenges such as homelessness and emergency response more effectively. The task force will also define the scope of a new independent ethics commission.</p>

          <p>A new, highly transmissible COVID subvariant has been detected in California, raising concerns about a potential summer wave as the Trump administration implements policy changes that may hinder vaccine access. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has rescinded the federal governmentâ€™s recommendation that pregnant women and healthy children get immunized against COVID. The recent federal changes could prompt private insurance companies and government insurers to stop paying for COVID shots for wide segments of the population.</p>
