          <h2>June Retail Sales Rise in UK, Driven by Weather but Overall Growth Slows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:28:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales saw a 0.9% increase in June, largely attributed to hot weather driving up fuel and supermarket sales, especially for beverages, as consumers ventured out. This rebound followed a larger 2.8% fall in May, making the June rise smaller than many economists had anticipated. Despite the monthly gain, the Office for National Statistics reported a broader loss of momentum, with sales up only 0.2% between April and June compared to the previous three months. This trend, coupled with weakened consumer confidence, supports economists' views that economic growth in the second quarter will be lacklustre, highlighting ongoing challenges despite seasonal boosts.</p>

          <h2>Puma Shares Drop Significantly Following Reduced Outlook Due to US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:24:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Puma's shares plummeted 18% after the sportswear brand reported worse-than-expected second-quarter sales and cut its full-year guidance, citing the significant impact of U.S. trade tariffs. The company now anticipates a low-double digit percentage decline in full-year sales and an operating profit loss for 2025, a stark contrast to previous forecasts. Key factors contributing to this revised outlook include muted brand momentum, shifts in channel mix, elevated inventory levels, and an estimated 80 million euro negative impact from U.S. tariffs. This financial setback highlights the broader challenges faced by global brands navigating volatile geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volkswagen reported a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst expectations, and subsequently lowered its full-year guidance. The auto giant cited the disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs, restructuring costs, and lower profit margins from electric vehicles as key challenges. The company now expects its operating return on sales to be between 4% to 5%, down from 5.5% to 6.5% previously, with full-year sales aligning with last year's figures instead of rising. This reflects the broader struggles of European automakers facing intense competition from Chinese brands and escalating trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to keep NHS services running with minimal disruption as resident doctors begin a five-day walkout. NHS England has instructed hospitals to cancel treatments only in exceptional circumstances, with senior doctors covering for striking resident doctors. However, the British Medical Association (BMA) warns this approach risks stretching staff too thinly and compromising safety. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer criticized the BMA for "rushing" into strikes, which threaten to reverse progress in rebuilding the NHS. The dispute centers on pay, with the BMA arguing real-terms pay is down by a fifth since 2008, despite recent increases.</p>

The crisis has seen a dramatic increase in hunger-related deaths, particularly among children, with aid agencies reporting extreme emaciation and a lack of vital treatment. Israel's heavy restrictions on aid entry have led to a critical shortage, despite thousands of tons of supplies awaiting entry in neighboring countries. International pressure is mounting for increased aid access and an immediate ceasefire, as the humanitarian catastrophe deepens and families struggle to find basic sustenance.</p>

          <p>India is under intensified pressure to finalize a trade deal with the U.S. before an August 1 deadline, which would see tariffs increase to 26%. This urgency is heightened by a recent U.S.-Japan trade agreement and India's efforts to protect sensitive agricultural sectors, as seen in its recent UK deal, which safeguarded these interests. Analysts suggest the U.S. views India as a strategic partner to counter China's global manufacturing dominance, potentially shifting supply chains to India and complementing U.S. efforts. India's multi-alignment strategy, including its role in BRICS, provides leverage in negotiations, allowing it to diversify trade partners and potentially soften the blow of higher U.S. tariffs.

The fossils, found in the Ste. Genevieve Formation, date back approximately 340 to 335 million years, when the area was submerged in a warm, shallow sea teeming with diverse life. This small shark, growing to less than a foot long, likely fed on mollusks and worms and is notable for its unique curved row of crushing teeth. This remarkable discovery underscores the importance of preserving and studying natural history, with over 40 different fossil shark species identified in the park recently.</p>

In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, arguing the law "meaningfully constrains" the right to keep and bear arms and lacks consistency with the country's historical tradition of firearm regulation. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the ruling as a "slap in the face" to gun violence prevention efforts, while the state's Attorney General is exploring legal options.

The outbreak, particularly severe in Chiapas, has caught many off guard despite past occurrences in the 1980s and 1990s. Treatment costs have soared, forcing some to resort to home remedies like applying gasoline to wounds. While Mexico is building a sterile fly production plant with U.S. support, it won't be ready until next year, leaving ranchers to face significant economic losses.

A pilot scheme participant received £14 a month, which she noted only "scratches the surface" of the added 35% cost of a gluten-free diet, as gluten-free products are significantly more expensive.

          <p>President Donald Trump is visiting Scotland to open a new 18-hole golf course and visit two other properties he owns, a trip that has drawn scrutiny given ongoing global crises like Gaza and Ukraine. While in the UK, Trump is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to discuss trade, alongside Scotland's First Minister John Swinney. This trip highlights Trump's tendency to blend personal business with presidential duties, and it comes with a massive security operation and anticipated anti-Trump demonstrations in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Business leaders, particularly Scotch whisky producers, are urging discussions on reducing US import taxes, or tariffs, during these meetings.</p>

          <p>The United States has cut short Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar and recalled its negotiating team, with President Donald Trump's special envoy accusing Hamas of lacking "good faith" in the negotiations. This marks a significant setback for efforts to broker a truce in the 21-month conflict, as humanitarian conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate, with aid groups reporting near-famine conditions. Hamas expressed surprise at the U.S. remarks, asserting its flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement, while Israel also recalled its negotiating team. The breakdown of talks leaves the path to a ceasefire unclear, despite mounting international pressure for an end to the devastation and increased aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Under new Trump administration rules, the U.S. military is taking a central role in deterring migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, tripling troop deployments to 7,600 personnel. This expansion includes empowering troops to apprehend immigrants in militarized zones, a significant shift from traditional civilian law enforcement. Despite a 60-year low in illegal crossings, officials argue the increased military presence is crucial for stopping "got-aways" and disrupting cartels. The strategy, which includes armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones, has raised concerns about the military's role in domestic law enforcement and has restricted public access to certain border areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to reshape college sports by empowering federal agencies to enforce new provisions on athletic scholarships and Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to protect non-revenue sports, particularly women's and Olympic sports, by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship numbers. It also targets "pay-for-play" NIL deals, asserting they should not be permitted by universities. This move, following a class action settlement allowing direct player payments, signals increased federal intervention in college athletics. While aligning with NCAA priorities, legal experts question the order's enforceability and potential for partisan divides.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws, which federal officials argue intentionally obstruct immigration enforcement and compromise public safety. The lawsuit comes shortly after an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot in Manhattan, with two undocumented immigrants charged. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan condemned sanctuary policies, stating they release criminals onto the streets, and promised to "flood the zones" with agents. The New York Immigration Coalition, however, called the lawsuit frivolous, asserting that sanctuary policies encourage crime reporting by all residents, regardless of immigration status, thereby keeping communities safer.</p>

The project's estimated cost has ballooned to $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion due to factors like inflation and tariffs, further fueling Trump's criticisms of Powell, particularly regarding interest rates.
