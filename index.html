          <p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman issued a stern warning to violent protesters, stating that they will be tracked down, arrested, prosecuted, and punished. Standing alongside LA Sheriff Robert Luna and LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, Hochman announced felony charges against several rioters accused of attacking officers, looting stores, and vandalizing public property. Sheriff Luna emphasized the distinction between peaceful protesters and violent anarchists, while Chief McDonnell highlighted the dangers officers face, including attacks with fireworks and Molotov cocktails. The authorities are committed to facilitating peaceful First Amendment activity but will stop violence and destruction. </p>

          <p>Sources have informed CBS News that Israel is preparing to launch an operation into Iran, leading the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq. This concern prompted the State Department to advise non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Despite these developments, President Trump's Middle East envoy is scheduled to meet with Iran for further nuclear program talks. Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, though neither Israeli officials nor White House spokespeople have commented on the potential operation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from 86-million-year-old skeletons found in Mongolia, which is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small, fleet-footed predators to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. Khankhuuluu, weighing approximately 750kg, represents a transitional fossil with features that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws and bite force. The species' identification has helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree, providing new insights into the evolution of these apex predators. </p>

While the procedural vote passed largely along party lines, the final vote could face resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs. House Speaker Mike Johnson's narrow Republican majority means he can only afford to lose a few votes to pass the package. </p>

The simulation, created by researchers at the University of Electronic Science and Technology in Chengdu, models intricate landforms with nanosecond-level precision. The war game involves deploying a PLA mobile electronic warfare platform to disrupt electromagnetic signals across the island. The simulation aims to improve computational speed and maintain precision for channel modeling in large-scale battlefield environments. </p>
