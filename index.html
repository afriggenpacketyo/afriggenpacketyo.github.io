          <p>Struggling budget retail chain Poundland has been sold for a nominal £1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers by its owner, Polish firm Pepco. The sale comes as the chain faces a potential restructuring that could result in the closure of up to 100 stores across the UK. Poundland, which operates 825 stores and employs around 16,000 staff, has struggled to compete with other discount retailers, experiencing a decline in sales earlier this year. Pepco will retain a minority investment interest in Poundland, and the business will continue to operate under the Poundland brand in the UK and Dealz in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), some of whom have expressed skepticism about vaccines, particularly those related to COVID-19. This decision follows Kennedy's removal of all 17 previous members, citing conflicts of interest and a perceived lack of independent oversight. The new members, while possessing strong credentials in medicine and public health, appear to have less experience in immunology and vaccinology compared to previous committees. Concerns have been raised about some appointees spreading misinformation, especially regarding COVID-19 vaccines and mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to rise by 5% each year to fund local services, according to documents in the Spending Review, with additional increases expected to support police funding. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise council tax by up to 5% annually, and the Spending Review assumes they will maximize this increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that the 5% increase is a cap, not a requirement, and is intended to support services like social care and policing. The police precept, which funds community policing, can also be raised by £14 a year for a Band D council tax bill without a referendum.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics, reversing growth seen in the previous four months. This decline is attributed to the introduction of global trade tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases, which created business uncertainty. Industrial production and services output particularly suffered, while construction output saw some growth. The UK was hit with a 10% tariff from the U.S., while EU exports faced a 20% levy, though Britain has since negotiated a trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Michael Hiltzik argues that President Trump's policies, supported by Republicans in Congress, pose a serious threat to college affordability by increasing the burden on student loan borrowers. Efforts to provide student loan relief have been blocked, while new measures aim to raise loan costs and limit repayment options. The resumption of student loan payments has already caused credit scores to plummet for millions, affecting their access to credit and economic opportunities. The GOP's budget bill includes provisions that would reduce student aid and shift borrowers towards private lenders, exacerbating the problem.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning jazz drummer Terri Lyne Carrington pays tribute to Max Roach by revisiting his 1961 album, “We Insist!,” with her new album “We Insist 2025!,” reflecting on the continued relevance of issues like inequality and racism. Carrington collaborates with younger jazz artists, including vocalist Christie Dashiell, to bridge the gap between jazz history and its future. The album features trombonist Julian Priester, who appeared on Roach's original work, emphasizing the importance of mentorship and apprenticeships in jazz. Carrington hopes the record will introduce new fans to Roach's legacy and revive the spirit of protest music.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson's unreleased rap song, "Smart Girls," was intended to be a key part of his Sire Records album "Sweet Insanity," but it ultimately contributed to the album being shelved. Wilson aimed to create a song that uplifted women, contrasting with the negative portrayals in many rap songs at the time. The song, produced by Matt Dike, was described as a mix of Wilson's discography and collective memories of him within American music. Despite never being officially released, "Smart Girls" has circulated among Beach Boys fans and represents Wilson's openness to experimenting with different genres.</p>

The lawsuit, filed after lawmakers overruled Yoon's order, demands compensation of 100,000 won ($73) per plaintiff, alleging that the martial law and subsequent actions violated their basic rights and caused mental harm. The lead attorney, Lee Gum-gyu, previously helped oust conservative president Park Geun-hye and served on the National Assembly's legal team that confirmed Yoon's impeachment.

The hearing is expected to focus on the legal basis for the deployment of federal forces, the lack of coordination with state and local officials, and the conditions of residents swept up in the raids.

          <p>President Trump's claims of significant economic growth resulting from the proposed "Big Beautiful Bill" are being questioned, with critics arguing that the benefits are overstated. While extending the 2017 tax cuts may prevent economic pain, it is unlikely to generate substantial new growth, as much of the potential boost has already been realized. The bill includes various tax breaks and spending hikes that are not pro-growth, and it is projected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt, potentially hindering long-term growth. The negative consequences of Trump's trade wars further undermine the bill's growth-enhancing powers.</p>

While most researchers and activists see destructive riots and looting as unhelpful outgrowths of protests, perceptions among Americans vary widely on the appropriateness of such demonstrations.
