          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on Niger's junta government to resolve disputes with Chinese energy companies through dialogue. This request was made during talks with Nigerien counterpart Bakary Yaou SangarÃ© in Changsha. The call comes after Niger expelled three Chinese oil executives and revoked the license of a Chinese-owned hotel due to discriminatory practices and salary disparities. Wang emphasized the need to ensure the safety and rights of Chinese companies and citizens in Niger, particularly regarding the Agadem oilfield and pipeline project, which is a significant investment for CNPC. The Soraz refinery was also completed in 2011 with CNPC investment.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man previously wrongly deported and then returned to the U.S., was arraigned in Nashville on charges of conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants from Latin America into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025, transporting them through Mexico and into Texas. Abrego Garcia's lawyers claim the charges are an abuse of power by the Trump administration, while prosecutors maintain he is a member of the MS-13 gang and poses a flight risk. The Justice Department maintains it has fulfilled a court order to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., while Abrego Garcia's attorneys are pursuing contempt proceedings against the government, citing delays and secrecy in the process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the construction industry promotes deconstruction, or taking apart buildings piece by piece, as a method to reuse materials, reduce landfill waste, and minimize the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction creates a circular economy by harvesting lumber and other materials from old buildings instead of sourcing new ones. While deconstruction can be more costly and time-consuming, some local governments are incentivizing or requiring it to meet waste reduction goals. The future of climate-conscious construction involves planning for disassembly before a building is even built, thus ensuring materials can be reused. The practice can limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so it is important that the practice continues to develop and be more widely adopted.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent attack on Iran has been described as more wide-ranging and intense than previous military operations, adopting a strategy similar to the offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon. The strikes aimed to neutralize Iran's missile bases and eliminate key members of its leadership, including the military chief of staff, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, and several top nuclear scientists. This action has inflicted an unprecedented degree of damage on Iran's elite, potentially necessitating a fiercer response from Iran than seen in previous attacks.

Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness.

          <h2>Analysts Doubt Iran Will Block Strait of Hormuz Amid Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The strait sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil pass through, but a full-scale disruption is considered improbable and potentially impossible. Experts suggest that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially since its oil infrastructure hasn't been directly targeted. China, Iran's largest oil customer, would likely pressure Iran to maintain oil flows, and disrupting the channel could harm Iran's own imports.</p>

          <p>David Attenborough's Ocean film highlights the destruction of marine life, primarily caused by the fishing industry. The film advocates for a shift in perspective, prioritizing protection of the seas rather than exploitation, and suggests concentrating residual fishing in local coastal communities. Research indicates that trawling and dredging release large amounts of carbon from the seabed, adding to the environmental costs of the fishing industry. Despite the government's announcement to ban trawling in some MPAs, more comprehensive measures are needed to achieve good environmental status for the seas, given the small size of the fishing industry.</p>

          <p>The price of Obamacare plans could surge next year due to the expiration of enhanced subsidies put in place during the pandemic. Without these subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, disproportionately affecting low-income enrollees. Middle-income enrollees would no longer be eligible for subsidies, and the number of uninsured people could increase by millions. While some propose extending the enhanced subsidies, others argue they facilitate fraud and worsen health inflation, creating a complex debate over the future of affordable healthcare.</p>

          <p>Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is accused of sending "medical disinformation" to Congress to support his decision to change U.S. policy on COVID vaccines. The document cites unpublished or disputed studies and mischaracterizes others to justify ending recommendations for COVID vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children. Health experts have criticized the document as "willful medical disinformation" that distorts legitimate studies and omits key data. The announcement, bypassing the CDC's formal process, has been met with outrage by pediatricians and scientists, with some questioning the credibility of the information being presented to lawmakers.</p>

The attacks followed repeated Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which the IAEA declared was in contravention of non-proliferation agreements, and the U.S. warned against an Iranian nuclear weapons program but denied involvement in the Israeli attack.</p>

          <p>Families of the victims of the Air India crash in Ahmedabad are grappling with grief and uncertainty as DNA testing is underway to identify the deceased. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed into a medical college in a densely packed residential neighborhood shortly after takeoff. With only one survivor confirmed, relatives are clinging to hope while awaiting closure, and many bodies are badly charred and mangled, making identification difficult. The tragedy has impacted both passengers and residents, including those at BJ Medical College Civil Hospital, where the plane crashed into the hostel.</p>
