          <h2>UK Faces Potential Tax Hikes Following Higher-Than-Expected Borrowing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are warning that the UK's Chancellor Rachel Reeves may need to raise taxes in the autumn after government borrowing in April exceeded expectations, reaching £20.2bn, £1bn higher than the previous year. The figures represent the fourth-highest April borrowing since 1993, putting pressure on Reeves to meet spending and borrowing rules. Factors like weaker economic growth forecasts and potential increases in spending, such as the reinstatement of some winter fuel payments, exacerbate the issue. Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the Labour chancellor's spending, while Liberal Democrat spokesperson Daisy Cooper raised concerns about potential economic blunders.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar condemned the act as antisemitism resulting from incitement since the October 7th massacre. President Donald Trump and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also condemned the violence, emphasizing that terrorism and hate will not be tolerated in the city.

          <p>The United States is contemplating the installation of a new missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting against aerial and space-based threats. Inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, the US system would cost an estimated $175 billion and is slated for completion by January 2029. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the Golden Dome will progressively protect the nation from aerial attacks, citing advancements in adversaries' long-range weapons. The project has sparked international debate, with China criticizing it for undermining global strategic stability, while Canada has expressed interest in collaborating on the plan.</p>

          <p>A last-minute injunction by a High Court judge has temporarily paused the UK government from finalizing talks on the Chagos Islands deal with Mauritius. The legal action was brought by two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, who seek to return to the islands. The agreement would hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base there for 99 years. The Chagossian community remains divided on the fate of their homeland, with some prioritizing their right to return and others focusing on their status in the UK.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering reusing soil removed from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. The initiative aims to set a precedent for soil recycling outside Fukushima Prefecture, following local opposition to demonstration projects in Tokyo and its vicinity. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry based on demonstration projects in Fukushima, would be used for flowerbeds and other purposes. This move is part of Japan's effort to recycle soil with relatively low radioactivity for public works and reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal.</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing from June 1, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to US tariffs. The decision stems from internal and external factors, with the sportswear giant citing regular "price adjustments." While not explicitly naming US tariffs, most of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will primarily affect shoes costing over $100, with clothing and equipment also seeing increases between $2 and $10. UK retailer JD Sports also anticipates that higher prices in the US market due to tariffs could impact customer demand.</p>

          <p>Paul Elie's "The Last Supper" captures a pivotal moment in 20th-century social history, exploring the clash between religion, art, and sexuality in the 1980s. The book examines how artists like Andy Warhol, Sinéad O’Connor, Bob Dylan, and Martin Scorsese grappled with religion in their work. Elie terms this art form crypto-religion, in which artists negotiated the “liminal space between belief and non-belief,”. Elie's survey places the reader in the thick of a convulsive era when ideas about the role of religion in modern life were fighting it out in the public sphere in ways that we haven’t seen since.</p>
