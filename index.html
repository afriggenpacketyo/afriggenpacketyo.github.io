          <p>Millions of people across Spain, Portugal, and parts of France experienced power outages due to an unspecified grid issue, prompting an emergency crisis meeting by the Spanish government. Red El√©ctrica, the Spanish grid operator, is working to restore power, estimating a full restoration within six to ten hours and prioritizing generators in the meantime. Airports are experiencing significant delays, particularly in Lisbon and Madrid, and authorities are urging residents to stay home and avoid travel until the situation is resolved. The cause of the outage is under analysis, with some reports suggesting an atmospheric phenomenon, but cybersecurity has been ruled out.</p>

          <p>As Canadians head to the polls in a snap election, US President Donald Trump has reiterated his desire for Canada to become the 51st state, posting on Truth Social about the prospect of free access without a border. Current Prime Minister Mark Carney, leader of the Liberal party, has consistently rejected this notion, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty. The election pits Carney against Conservative Pierre Poilievre, with polls indicating a close race.

          <p>US agriculture exporters are reporting a 'full-blown crisis' due to the ongoing trade war and tariffs, particularly with China, leading to canceled export orders and layoffs. A major cancellation of pork orders by China, the largest since 2020, highlights the severity of the situation, with significant financial losses reported by members of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition. Exporters of wood pulp and grass seed have also experienced immediate cancellations, causing disruptions in supply chains and potential abandonment of cargo. The Port of Oakland warns that reduced cargo volume due to tariffs could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Experts predict that gold prices, which have already surpassed $3,300 per ounce, could continue to rise due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable market performance. Factors such as bank failures, potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, and ongoing trade wars are driving investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. While reaching $4,000 per ounce may require significant market shifts like the Federal Reserve dropping interest rates to zero, experts suggest that gold remains a viable investment for protecting against inflation and diversifying portfolios (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the original amount owed, may not immediately improve your credit score and could initially cause it to dip. While it can be a strategic financial move to manage unmanageable debt, credit scoring models often view it less favorably than paying the full amount as agreed. Settled accounts are typically marked as 'settled' on credit reports, signaling to lenders that the full balance was not repaid; however, if the account was already severely delinquent, settling the debt can be a step toward rebuilding credit over time by freeing up resources to maintain other obligations. Debt management and debt consolidation are other options which may improve credit scores.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are seeking to disqualify Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman from representing the state in their resentencing case, citing a conflict of interest. Their attorney, Mark Geragos, argues that Hochman hired an attorney who previously opposed the Menendez brothers' resentencing to head the district attorney's Office of Victims' Services. The motion alleges that this attorney, Kathleen Cady, also ignored the Menendez family members in her official capacity and did not warn them of graphic imagery from the murder scene that would be displayed during an April 11 hearing in the resentencing proceedings. The Menendez brothers were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989 and are currently serving life without parole.</p>

          <p>Questions are being raised about why there were empty seats at the FA Cup semi-final match between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, despite Wembley Stadium's 90,000 capacity. Manchester City's frequent appearances at Wembley may have contributed to lower attendance, with only 27,000 tickets sold to their fans. Other factors, such as Nottingham Forest having a remarkable season and Crystal Palace being based in London, may have influenced ticket sales for the other semi-finalists. The logistics of distributing unsold tickets to the local community pose challenges.</p>

          <p>Cicadas are expected to emerge in the spring of 2025, with Brood XIV concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, and also appearing in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. The emergence will occur when the soil reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit, with cicadas typically remaining for 4 to 6 weeks. These periodical cicadas, which emerge every 17 years, are known for their loud buzzing sounds and can appear in populations reaching trillions. The noise is a mating tactic used by male cicadas to attract females.</p>

          <p>Two former Pfizer headquarters buildings in Midtown Manhattan are being converted into approximately 1,600 rental apartments, in what is described as the largest office-to-apartment conversion nationwide. The project aims to address the glut of underutilized office spaces in the area, which lacks the residential appeal of other New York City neighborhoods. Developers have also acquired another nearby office building to create roughly 450 additional residences, with 25% designated as affordable housing. The first tenants are expected to move in at the end of next year, potentially revitalizing Midtown as a residential area.</p>

His remarks come as Democrats search for new leadership and as Trump faces low approval ratings ahead of his 100 days in office benchmark. Pritzker's aides say his stance stems from his family history.</p>

The S&P 500 experienced a significant decline in April following Trump's tariff announcement, although a subsequent pause on some tariffs eased some concerns.
