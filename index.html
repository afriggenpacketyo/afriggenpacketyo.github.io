          <h2>New Chinese Naval Drone Vessel Revealed During Parade Rehearsal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new uncrewed naval vessel, believed to be a drone boat, was observed during a rehearsal for China's Victory Day parade in Beijing. Photographs show a vessel with significant stealth features, including angled surfaces and a faceted hull designed to reduce its radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures. The boat, painted in Chinese navy camouflage, appears to be over 15 meters long and includes cockpit windows, suggesting it can also be operated by a crew. This public appearance indicates a notable advancement in China's development of unmanned naval technology for military applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new cultural trend, popularized by Gen Z on TikTok, involves identifying and humorously critiquing the 'performative male.' This archetype is characterized by men who adopt an alternative, intellectual, and 'soft' aesthetic, often seen as a strategic effort to attract progressive women. While public contests mimicking these men are largely lighthearted, the trend also reflects a deeper societal skepticism about authenticity in dating, stemming from concerns that such personas could mask manipulative behaviors. The article explores whether this is a harmless joke or a sign of growing distrust between genders in the modern dating landscape.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant address on Ukraine's Independence Day, vowing the nation would persist in its fight for freedom against Russian aggression. The celebrations in Kyiv were marked by renewed pledges of international support, including significant military aid packages from Canada, the UK, and Norway. The day was also overshadowed by ongoing hostilities, as Russia launched overnight drone attacks, including one that caused a fire at the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant. This incident has amplified international concerns regarding the safety and security of nuclear facilities during the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Academics Question Scale of US WWII Support Ahead of Victory Day</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In anticipation of China's 80th anniversary Victory Day parade, articles from a Chinese academic institution with official ties are challenging the historical narrative of US aid during World War II. These publications downplay the significance of American support while elevating the contributions of the Soviet Union, characterizing Moscow's assistance as crucial. This reflects a broader official effort in China to reshape the Western-centric history of the war.

          <p>Europe's largest street festival, the Notting Hill Carnival, began in west London with its traditional children's parade, filling the streets with vibrant costumes and music. The festivities started at dawn with J'ouvert, where revelers celebrated with colorful paint and powder to mark the opening of the Bank Holiday weekend event. The annual celebration, which has a history spanning over 50 years, will also include a 72-second silence on both days. This moment of reflection honors the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away in recent years.</p>

          <p>Target has announced that COO Michael Fiddelke will succeed Brian Cornell as CEO in 2026, a decision met with a 6.3% stock decline and skepticism from Wall Street. Many investors had hoped for an external candidate to address the company's recent struggles with sales and profits. Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran who rose from an intern position, inherits several significant challenges, including improving grocery price competitiveness with Walmart and revitalizing the in-store experience. His success will depend on his ability to implement a fresh strategy and quickly win over a doubtful market.</p>

          <p>The head of Russia's state atomic energy corporation, Rosatom, stated that Moscow faces 'colossal threats' and must improve its nuclear capabilities. These comments come shortly after a summit between President Putin and President Trump, where little concrete progress was made toward a peace deal in Ukraine. While the U.S. and Russia hold 90% of the world's nuclear warheads, the future of arms control is uncertain as the New START Treaty is set to expire in 2026. Russia's heightened nuclear rhetoric contributes to an increasingly precarious global security environment amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into professional fields, a crucial distinction must be made between designing AI for full automation versus collaboration. Prematurely automating entire jobs with imperfect AI can undermine human expertise and lead to critical errors, as seen in studies where radiologists' accuracy declined when using an AI diagnostic tool. Instead, experts argue for developing AI as a collaborative tool, like a pilot's heads-up display, which enhances human skills by providing data and insights without taking full control. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of both humans and machines, leading to better outcomes in complex, high-stakes decision-making.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the country's largest socialist organization, is hampered by deep internal ideological divisions that prevent it from becoming a unified and effective political force. The organization is split between a 'mass-politics' wing, which aims to win elections within the Democratic Party, and a more radical 'sectarian' wing with extremist and anti-democratic views. This factionalism was evident at a recent convention where resolutions to censure mainstream figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were proposed.

          <p>In a personal essay, a mother recounts the profound connection she developed by reading aloud to her newborn son, a practice that evolved from complex novels to simple board books. She argues that this act is not just about instilling a love for literature in a child but is also a powerful tool for a parent to learn how to 'read' their own baby. By observing her son's reactions—the flickers of recognition and smiles—she gained insight into his developing mind and personality. The author suggests that parents who don't read to their young children miss a unique opportunity for mutual discovery and understanding.</p>

The sport provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and cardiovascular health, with one study linking it to a nearly decade-longer lifespan compared to sedentary peers. Beyond its physical advantages, tennis demands complex motor coordination and rapid decision-making, which enhances cognitive functions like reaction time and buffers against age-related decline. Its accessibility and social nature further contribute to its appeal as a healthy and enjoyable long-term activity.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'The First and Last Bank,' proposes a novel approach to climate change by creating a system of community-based carbon banks. The concept, developed by an anthropologist and an artist, draws a parallel to how the U.S. government sequesters gold, rendering it priceless and taking it out of circulation. They envision a system where organic waste is converted into a stable carbon form called biochar, which is then 'deposited' in exchange for a local digital currency. This grassroots model aims to create value for sequestered carbon, incentivizing its removal from the atmosphere without relying on government mandates.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, causing over 1,400 deaths and historic flooding, the city continues to grapple with its legacy. The disaster exposed catastrophic failures in the levee system, built by the Army Corps of Engineers, and in the government's emergency response, particularly from FEMA. Despite predictions and simulation exercises that foretold the potential for such a disaster, preparations were inadequate. Today, while a nearly $15 billion levee system has been rebuilt, concerns persist about coastal erosion and whether the lessons from Katrina are being heeded, especially as political discussions arise about reducing FEMA's role in disaster response.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend and Hall of Famer Pam Shriver is leading a new initiative to help rebuild Southern California communities devastated by recent wildfires. Through her foundation, Village Rising, Shriver is focusing on revitalizing parks, schools, and sports programs, using tennis as a 'through line' to bring people together and restore a sense of normalcy. Having been personally affected by evacuations, Shriver was moved by the resilience of the local communities and the fact that many tennis courts survived the flames. The foundation aims to quickly distribute grants to underfunded areas, particularly in the Palisades and Altadena, to support their recovery efforts.</p>

          <h2>Rapid Partisan Redistricting Push in California and Texas Signals New Political Era</h2>

          <p>In a swift escalation of partisan warfare, both Texas and California are advancing mid-decade redistricting plans designed to maximize their respective party's seats in Congress. The moves, initiated by President Trump's pressure on Texas Republicans and met with a rapid counter-proposal by California Democrats led by Governor Gavin Newsom, signal a departure from the norm of using independent commissions for fair mapping. This race to gerrymander reflects an increasingly aggressive political climate where both parties are willing to discard fairness principles in a raw pursuit of power, raising concerns among experts about the future of American democracy and voter representation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UC Berkeley IGS poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times shows that a majority of California voters, 69%, disapprove of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. The survey reveals a stark partisan divide, with 95% of Democrats disapproving while 79% of Republicans approve. A significant portion of voters, 64%, expressed feelings of rage or sadness over immigration raids, believing they unfairly target Latinos. While Democrats are nearly unanimous in their opposition, the poll indicates that Republican voters are more fractured on specific tactics, such as whether agents should be required to clearly identify themselves during operations.</p>

          <p>A small, lightning-sparked fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim, initially managed as a beneficial 'good fire' by park officials, exploded into a massive wildfire that has burned over 145,000 acres. The blaze destroyed some 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. This incident has become a major setback for advocates of controlled burns, a modern fire science strategy used to reduce fuel loads and promote ecological health. Investigations will now focus on whether a colossal error, unforeseen weather changes, or federal job cuts contributed to the catastrophic failure of the containment strategy.</p>

          <p>In a contributor piece, a healthcare technology executive outlines the vision for a modernized, patient-centric healthcare system in the U.S., spurred by a recent White House initiative. The goal is to create a secure, interoperable national health IT infrastructure where a patient's medical information is easily and securely accessible to them and their providers. This would eliminate redundant paperwork and enable advanced digital tools, like AI assistants and personalized health apps, to transform raw data into actionable insights. The article argues that this public-private partnership is essential for improving patient outcomes, reducing provider burden, and creating a more efficient healthcare ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military announced that it has killed 35 jihadists in a series of air strikes conducted near the country's border with Cameroon. The operation targeted four different areas and was intended to prevent planned attacks on ground forces. This action comes as Nigeria continues its long-standing battle against multiple security threats, including jihadist insurgencies and widespread criminal violence. Recently, prominent Nigerians have expressed alarm over 'war-time levels of slaughter' in the country, citing a report that over 10,000 people have been killed since President Bola Tinubu took office two years ago.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a list of 'objectionable' art and content at the Smithsonian Institution, targeting works that focus on race, slavery, and sexuality. This follows a directive for a 'comprehensive review' to align the museums with President Trump's cultural vision. Artists and scholars whose work was singled out have responded with a mix of shock, defiance, and concern, with some calling the inclusion a 'badge of honor' while others fear it will have a chilling effect on artistic expression. Critics compare the move to historical instances of censorship, worrying it will lead to self-censorship within museums and galleries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policy decisions, both at home and abroad, appear to be consistently guided by his personal interests rather than a coherent ideology. This was highlighted by his recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where he seemed to accept the Russian leader's views on U.S. elections, leading to a new executive order targeting mail-in voting. Critics argue that Trump's conflation of personal grievances with national policy makes him vulnerable to manipulation and creates chaos. His approach breaks from presidential norms, as he often uses international stages to air domestic complaints and attack political predecessors, blurring the lines between personal agenda and statecraft.</p>

The film, about a fictional all-girl K-pop band battling evil, has become a massive hit, with its soundtrack dominating music charts. This move by Netflix is seen as both a gift to its large fan base and a strategic promotion to expand its audience further.
