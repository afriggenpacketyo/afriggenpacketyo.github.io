          <p>Geopolitical tensions have risen as President Trump adopts a more negative stance on nuclear talks with Iran, leading to a spike in oil prices. The U.S. has announced the withdrawal of some personnel from the Middle East, and Trump accuses Tehran of "delaying" negotiations. Meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations. Despite ongoing talks, Israel is considering military action against Iran, with the major roadblock being Iran's domestic uranium enrichment, which Trump opposes, raising the risk of a potential military conflict.</p>

          <p>Kenyan police used tear gas to disperse protesters in Nairobi who were angered by the death of blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody. The demonstrations turned violent, with reports of vehicles being set on fire, after President Ruto acknowledged that Ojwang died "at the hands of the police." Ojwang was arrested for allegedly defaming the country's deputy police chief, and police initially claimed he died from hitting his head against a cell wall. An autopsy revealed that Ojwang's wounds indicated assault as the cause of death, prompting an investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority.</p>

The film, told in three chapters, explores the life of an ordinary accountant through a non-linear narrative, capturing the bittersweet and familiar core of King's writing. Flanagan's direction highlights the ordinary foundation upon which the supernatural is built, using different aspect ratios and tones to give each storyline its own life.

The discussion covers Musk's early successes with Tesla and SpaceX, his embrace of the "genius" persona, and his recent controversies, including his relationship with Trump and his management of Twitter. Helen Lewis, author of "The Genius Myth," argues that the label of "genius" is often tied to ego and the need to maintain attention, potentially leading to a downfall when the individual's actions no longer align with the public's expectations.</p>

The author criticizes the Court's reliance on the "unitary executive" doctrine and its inconsistent application, particularly in relation to the Federal Reserve, and highlights the Dobbs v.

Rae's debut, however, embraces strangeness and experimentation, evoking electronic artists like Aphex Twin and Timbaland, while retaining a simple allure.
