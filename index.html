          <p>President Trump received a lavish welcome from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, underscoring the strong diplomatic and business ties between the two nations. The welcome included fighter jet escorts, Arabian horse riders, and a tour of the Royal Court's opulent surroundings. Trump expressed his affinity for the Saudi royals, highlighting their understanding of his tastes and desires, with the article noting the Saudi royals are his family's business partners. The president also attended the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, viewing models of Saudi megaprojects and a gallery showcasing the history of Saudi-American partnership, before touring Diriyah, the ancestral home of the Saudi royal family. The article draws a comparison between the Saudi royal's gold leaf decor and Trump's affinity for gold in his personal residences.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years. The judge cited their remarkable work in prison, including educational courses and programs for inmates, as a factor in the decision. During the hearing, the brothers delivered emotional statements, expressing remorse for their actions and acknowledging the pain they caused their family. The Los Angeles County District Attorney opposed the resentencing, arguing the brothers have not fully taken responsibility for their crimes, but the judge ultimately ruled in favor of resentencing, noting that the previous sentence was justified at the time. A parole board hearing is scheduled for next month to determine their potential release.</p>

          <p>India has publicly refuted President Trump's claims regarding U.S. mediation efforts in the recent cease-fire between India and Pakistan. Trump stated he offered trade incentives and warnings to both countries, leading to the cessation of hostilities, however, an Indian official denied that trade was discussed during the conversations between Indian and U.S. leaders. This public contradiction highlights India's concern about how its public perceives its military actions and its relationship with the U.S. The article notes that India has long tried to isolate Pakistan as a small problem that it can handle on its own, and Trump's statements undermined that effort.</p>

          <p>State Farm has been granted temporary approval to increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, following a request made in the wake of devastating wildfires. This increase comes after a 20% rate hike last year, drawing criticism from consumer groups and homeowners who have struggled to receive fair payments after their homes were destroyed. The state's insurance commissioner framed the decision as a difficult compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis, but Consumer Watchdog argued that State Farm has not justified the need for such a large rate increase. The higher rates are set to take effect on June 1, with a further hearing scheduled for the fall to address State Farm's financial health.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of French nuclear weapons in Europe, noting that the United States already stations nuclear-armed aircraft in the region. Macron emphasized that any expansion of France's nuclear deterrence would be subject to conditions, including maintaining France's own defense capabilities and retaining sole control over the weapons' use. Germany and other Eastern European nations have shown interest in the proposal, driven by concerns about the reliability of the U.S.' nuclear commitment to Europe amid the ongoing threat from Russia. Macron clarified that France does not want to provoke "World War III" over the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A House committee session to consider Medicaid cuts and other elements of President Trump's domestic policy bill was disrupted by protesters, leading to arrests and heated debates. Democrats and Republicans clashed over the proposed changes, with Democrats accusing Republicans of taking healthcare away from vulnerable people, while Republicans argued that Democrats were misrepresenting the Medicaid cuts. The committee debated various provisions of the bill, including tax cuts and changes to environmental policy, but the proposed reductions in Medicaid coverage remained a central point of contention. The article notes that the bill would reduce federal spending by an estimated $912 billion and cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, according to a partial analysis from the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

          <p>Hasan Piker, a popular Twitch streamer and political commentator, claims he was detained and questioned by federal authorities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after returning from a family vacation. Piker alleges that he was asked about his political beliefs, including his opinions on Donald Trump, Israel, Hamas, and the Houthis rebels. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that Piker was detained but denied that his political beliefs were the reason for the inspection. Legal analysts suggest that while international travelers give up certain Fourth Amendment rights, there is a line that cannot be crossed when questioning them.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez have been resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially paving the way for their release after over three decades for the murder of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' efforts to turn their lives around through education and self-help groups while incarcerated, influenced by letters from corrections officials. The brothers expressed remorse and took responsibility for their actions during the hearing. While the resentencing makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final decision rests with the state's parole officials and Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

The book, "Original Sin," suggests Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed using a wheelchair. Biden's spokesperson dismissed the claims, stating that "evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity." The book also cites sources claiming that Biden's late exit from the 2024 race negatively impacted the Democratic Party, with Vice President Harris failing to defeat Trump in the subsequent election.</p>

          <p>California has approved a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers, following a judge's ruling that the company faces a "dire" financial situation after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The decision grants State Farm a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company, but also requires the company to justify its financial condition in a future hearing. The increase has drawn criticism from fire survivors and consumer advocates, who argue that State Farm has been delaying insurance payments. The state's insurance commissioner defended the decision as a necessary measure to protect State Farm customers and the integrity of the insurance market.</p>
