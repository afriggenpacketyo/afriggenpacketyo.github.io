          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning about the "rising" and unpredictable national security threat posed by Iran. The report details concerns over a significant increase in plots against opponents of the Iranian regime residing in the UK, alongside threats of espionage and cyber attacks. The committee urges the government to adopt a more strategic, long-term approach beyond crisis management, emphasizing that Iran's well-resourced intelligence services present a persistent and wide-ranging danger that should not be underestimated.</p>

          <p>Dispatch audio from Kerr County, Texas, reveals that local officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after a firefighter's initial request as floodwaters began to rise. Some alerts were not sent for nearly six hours, by which time the catastrophic flooding had already impacted many residents. The delay has sparked scrutiny of the county's emergency response procedures, especially since its notification system, in place for a decade, was promoted as being capable of alerting the entire county within minutes.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer who went missing has been successfully rescued after spending a night alone on an uninhabited island. The teenager, Darcy Deefholts, had gone surfing off Wooli Beach and was reported missing when he failed to return home. A large-scale search operation located him the next day on North Solitary Island, approximately seven miles offshore. His father described the rescue as a "one in a million miracle," and the surfer is now receiving medical treatment.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a Los Angeles industrial tunnel that partially collapsed. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground when the cave-in occurred, but they managed to climb over a 12-foot pile of debris to reach a tunnel boring machine. From there, they were transported to safety with no major injuries reported. The tunnel is part of a $700 million project to carry treated wastewater to the Pacific Ocean, and work has been halted pending an investigation into the collapse.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the U.K., marked by royal pageantry, is taking place amid significant uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy. A key topic in discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer is how to navigate the Trump administration's unpredictable tariff regime, which poses a threat to European economies. While the U.K. has secured a trade deal, the European Union remains in limbo, hoping to finalize an agreement that could still see new duties imposed. The visit highlights the complex diplomatic landscape as European allies coordinate their response to Washington's protectionist stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director James Gunn is positioning the hero of his new "Superman" film as a figure of "universal morality" rather than a symbol of purely American ideals. The film reportedly begins with a battered Superman, meant to symbolize a nation in a beat-up state but still striving for goodness. This interpretation has sparked debate, with some right-wing commentators criticizing it as "woke" for focusing on kindness and global protection. The article notes the character's origins, created by Jewish immigrants as a defender of the weak, and his historical identity as a "moral immigrant" and an undocumented alien from another planet.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States, according to media reports. Company sources indicate that the decision was influenced by the high tariffs of 27.5% imposed by the Trump administration on new European-built cars, a significant increase from the previous 2.5%. The delivery halt is also compounded by a recall ordered by U.S. safety regulators concerning the vehicle's third-row seat design. This development comes as VW reports a nearly 7% drop in total vehicle deliveries to North America for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The system, powered by machine learning architecture similar to ChatGPT, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon on a life-like model. It was able to adapt to unexpected scenarios, respond to voice commands, and learn from feedback, marking a major leap from simply executing pre-programmed tasks. This breakthrough brings clinically viable autonomous surgical systems closer to reality, though human trials are still a necessary future step.</p>

The original report found that 16% of 70 respondents had engaged in "survival sex" with landlords, employers, or acquaintances.

Kerry's comments reflect an ongoing internal debate within the Democratic party over its immigration policies and whether a pro-immigration stance has become a political liability.

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are centered on a large and stable social-housing sector. This sector, comprising 43% of the city's housing units, is accessible to a wide range of income levels and keeps rent significantly lower than in the private market. The system originated in the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s and is sustained today by a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers a powerful model for other cities.</p>

These pulses create illusions that can command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. This technological achievement opens up new possibilities for monitoring and interacting with insects for various applications, from environmental sensing to search and rescue.</p>

In a social media post, Trump highlighted copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and energy technologies. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of the copper it consumes, and experts predict the tariff will cause a significant price increase for American consumers and businesses. The move aligns copper with the 50% duties already placed on steel and aluminum imports. (not investment advice)</p>
