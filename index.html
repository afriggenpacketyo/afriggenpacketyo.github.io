        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are rising about potential capital flight from the U.S. due to increasing yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs), particularly long-dated ones. Analysts suggest that if JGB yields continue to climb, Japanese investors might repatriate funds, triggering a global financial market crisis. This repatriation could strengthen the yen, negatively impacting U.S. tech stocks that have seen substantial Japanese investment, while tightening global liquidity and reducing world growth. Some analysts, however, believe the impact may be gradual, with a progressive erosion of confidence in the U.S. dollar rather than a sudden implosion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration aims to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly threatening to strike Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This disagreement over how to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons has led to tensions between President Trump and Mr. Netanyahu. Israel, not a participant in the U.S.-Iran negotiations, fears Trump may allow Iran to keep its uranium enrichment facilities in his eagerness for a deal.

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan concludes that possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalised. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, makes 42 recommendations, including removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalisation. The report also recommends improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education.</p>

          <p>Vodafone's recent full-year results have sparked dÃ©jÃ  vu among long-term followers, with the company claiming to be at an "inflexion point". This assertion is reminiscent of similar claims made in the past, highlighting the company's history of disappointing investors. Vodafone's fortunes are seen as a metaphor for corporate Britain, facing challenges in a changing global landscape. The company has undergone a long period of retrenchment after years of expansion, and investors are questioning whether the latest claims of improvement are justified.</p>

          <p>A 40-hour pellet-gun battle in Oklahoma re-enacts a conflict similar to the Russia-Ukraine war, drawing participants who dress as Russian or NATO soldiers. MilSim West organizes these military simulations. While organizers state the events are strictly fantasy, the ongoing war in Ukraine often influences participants' choice of uniforms and equipment. The re-enactment is attracting people to the hobby known as airsoft, where two teams fight each other with guns that shoot plastic BB pellets.</p>
