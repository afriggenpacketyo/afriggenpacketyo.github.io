          <p>Meta's shares experienced a rise following a report of higher-than-expected revenue in the first quarter, accompanied by a positive outlook for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter sales increased by 16% year-over-year, with net income jumping 35% to $16.64 billion. Despite these gains, Meta cautioned about a potential adverse impact on its European business due to a recent decision by the European Commission regarding its no-ads subscription service. The company is heavily investing in AI infrastructure, reflecting in increased capital expenditures for 2025, while also navigating macroeconomic uncertainties and online ad market headwinds. Optimism for Meta's future remains as they plan to monetize Meta AI.</p>

          <h2>Weight-Loss Drug Shows Promise in Treating Liver Disease</h2>

          <p>New research suggests that semaglutide, the compound found in the weight-loss drug Wegovy, could be effective in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a common liver disease. A study involving 800 adults with MASH showed that nearly 63% of those receiving semaglutide injections experienced a clearing of fat and inflammation in their livers without worsening of liver scarring. The drug's maker, Novo Nordisk, has sought FDA approval for Wegovy as a MASH treatment. The study highlights the potential of weight-loss drugs in addressing liver-related conditions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering whether Oklahoma can use government funds to support a religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The case centers on the First Amendment's stance on government establishment of religion versus the protection of religious freedom. The justices appeared divided, with Republican appointees showing support for the school and Democratic appointees expressing concerns. A ruling in favor of the school could have widespread implications for charter schools and the separation of church and state.</p>

The situation highlights concerns about due process and the treatment of migrants, as well as the relationship between the U.S. and El Salvador.</p>

The study, based on data from over 200,000 people across 22 countries, found that overall national composite flourishing decreased slightly as GDP per capita rose. Wealthier countries reported less meaning, fewer satisfying relationships, and fewer positive emotions compared to poorer countries. The study suggests that factors beyond economic prosperity, such as community involvement and relationships, play a crucial role in overall well-being.</p>
