          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated this move would help curtail Moscow's ability to finance its war in Ukraine and mentioned that there would be "a little bit of a process" before the halt is complete. India, one of the largest importers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices and protecting its consumers. The discussions are part of ongoing energy cooperation talks between the U.S. and India.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third quarter, with profits surging by 39.1% year-over-year and significantly exceeding market expectations. This impressive growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips, which TSMC manufactures for major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company reported that its most advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of its total wafer revenue for the quarter, highlighting the critical role of high-performance computing in its success.

Shelvey, 33, expressed concerns about safety and the social climate in the U.K., particularly in London, as a key reason for the relocation. He now plays in the UAE's third tier, combining his playing career with coaching qualifications. Shelvey also reflected fondly on his seven-year tenure at Newcastle, praising the club's passionate fanbase and the unique connection he felt there.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. The president also indicated that land-based operations are being considered, escalating a pressure campaign that has recently included deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the move, equating it to past CIA-orchestrated coups, while some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about the lack of congressional oversight for what they see as a slide towards outright conflict.</p>

This has sparked a political dispute, with the opposition accusing the current government of a cover-up to protect relations with Beijing, a claim the government denies.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent layoff notices to over 4,000 employees, with plans to cut thousands more. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and suggested they were an unlawful attempt to punish political opponents, citing public statements by the president. The order applies to workers represented by two major federal unions that filed the lawsuit, temporarily protecting their jobs while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

CMAT is the front-runner for her album "Euro-Country," while Pulp's acclaimed comeback record "More" is a close second. The event, which honors the best album from the UK and Ireland, is being held in Newcastle for the first time, part of a broader industry effort to decentralize major cultural events beyond London. Other notable nominees include Fontaines DC, PinkPantheress, and 84-year-old folk legend Martin Carthy, the oldest nominee in the prize's history.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army cult has condemned plans to distribute the group's multi-million-pound fortune to former members, some of whom have been accused of perpetrating or covering up abuse. A BBC investigation found that 172 former loyal members are set to receive significantly larger payouts than the compensation awarded to abuse victims through a redress scheme. Survivors have described the prospect as "sickening," while their lawyer called the situation "shameful." The trust managing the sect's assets, estimated at over £50 million, stated it lacks the legal power to redirect the funds for charitable use.</p>

          <p>A scientist who was recently laid off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid the government shutdown has warned that the terminations will lead to preventable deaths. The anonymous scientist, who worked on chronic diseases for a decade, described the situation as chaotic and said entire legally mandated programs have been eliminated. The Trump administration has laid off approximately 600 CDC employees as part of a plan to cut over 10,000 federal jobs. This has severely hampered the agency's ability to respond to public health threats, such as ongoing measles outbreaks, at a time when its capacity is critically needed.</p>

Vance characterized the exchanges, which included one message calling sexual assault "epic" and another stating "I love Hitler," as "what kids do." Despite public records indicating the participants are adults aged 24 to 35, Vance suggested they were much younger and argued against ruining their lives over offensive jokes. His comments contrast with bipartisan calls for the individuals involved to resign from their positions within the Republican organization.</p>

The monument, inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, would be situated across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial and is reportedly being funded by private donors. This project is the latest in a series of aesthetic changes the president has initiated in the capital, which include a gilded White House makeover and the creation of a $250 million ballroom. Trump has shown models of the proposed arch to donors, expressing his preference for the largest version.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation into California's jury duty system has found that over 2.7 million residents, or one in four people summoned, failed to appear last year with minimal repercussions. While courts threaten fines and other penalties, the analysis of state data shows that roughly 21% of counties do not enforce any sanctions at all for dodging jury duty. Legal experts warn this failure to enforce compliance could undermine the right to a fair trial by a jury of one's peers. Some courts are experimenting with incentives like higher pay and improved facilities to encourage participation, as the cost of enforcement is considered prohibitive.</p>
