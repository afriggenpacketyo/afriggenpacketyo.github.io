          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested three individuals for allegedly assisting a suspect wanted in the killing of four relatives of an infant who was found abandoned but alive. Dearrah Sanders, Tanaka Brown, and Giovonte Thomas face charges of being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. The primary suspect, 28-year-old Austin Robert Drummond, remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous, with a significant reward offered for information leading to his capture. Investigators believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a relationship with the family, though many details about the motive and the crime itself remain undisclosed to the public.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages are criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported plan to pursue a "decisive military victory" following the collapse of ceasefire negotiations with Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum warned that this approach could endanger their loved ones, labeling military rescue attempts a "fraud." Meanwhile, Hamas has stated it would grant the Red Cross access to hostages if humanitarian corridors are opened throughout Gaza.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, many individuals nearing retirement are considering annuities to secure guaranteed income. The choice between fixed and variable annuities presents a key dilemma, as each offers distinct advantages in today's high-interest-rate environment. Fixed annuities provide safety and predictable returns, allowing savers to lock in currently favorable rates before potential cuts later this year. Conversely, variable annuities offer the potential for higher, market-linked growth, which may be more appealing for those with a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance.

          <p>A federal court case challenging President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose widespread tariffs is expected to reach the Supreme Court. The dispute centers on Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his "Liberation Day" tariffs, a move a lower court blocked. The U.S. Court of Appeals is hearing the case on an expedited basis, with a ruling anticipated in the coming weeks. Regardless of the outcome, both the administration and the plaintiffs plan to appeal, setting the stage for a pivotal high court review of executive power in trade policy.</p>

          <p>According to a communication expert, certain common phrases can undermine one's credibility and authority in professional settings. Phrases like "I think," "Does that make sense?" and "Sorry to bother you" may signal doubt or devalue your message before it is even considered. The article recommends replacing these with more powerful and direct alternatives, such as swapping "I think" with "I recommend" to show conviction. Other suggestions include replacing apologetic prefaces with purposeful statements and avoiding self-deprecating qualifiers like "This might be a dumb question," to project confidence and ensure your ideas are taken seriously.</p>

Robinson had reportedly left for Tenerife shortly after the incident on July 28, where a man was found with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. He was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and is now in custody for questioning, with social media footage showing him near the injured man after the alleged assault.</p>

          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has made a public appeal for donations of unwanted pets, such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and chickens, to be used as food for its predators. The zoo states this practice helps imitate the animals' natural food chain and provides a more natural diet, especially for its lions, tigers, and lynx. The donated animals are reportedly euthanized humanely by trained staff before being fed to the carnivores. The zoo also accepts horses, offering owners a potential tax deduction, and says the practice of using donated livestock as feed has been common for many years.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is calling for police to be required to release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments follow the charging of two men, reported to be Afghan nationals, in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest, referencing last year's deadly attack in Southport. Current national policing guidelines do not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged, a policy Farage believes should be changed immediately.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, researchers have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of sea stars along the West Coast since 2013. A new study pinpoints a specific bacterium, Vibrio pectinocida, as the pathogen responsible for the epidemic, which was particularly devastating to the sunflower sea star population. This discovery is a major breakthrough for conservation efforts, as it could lead to the development of diagnostic tests and strategies for breeding disease-resistant sea stars. Restoring the sunflower sea star, a keystone species, is critical for controlling urchin populations and protecting vital kelp forest ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to lead Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. Appointed Director-General in 1992, her tenure marked a period of increased openness for the traditionally secretive organization, and she became the first head to be publicly named. Her groundbreaking appointment was said to have inspired the casting of Judi Dench as M in the James Bond film series. After retiring, Rimington wrote a memoir and a successful series of spy thrillers, leaving a legacy that paved the way for other women in top UK intelligence roles.</p>

The new committee will advise the government and encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented communities and regions.

This move, where minority party members leave the state to prevent the legislature from conducting business, serves to delay legislation and draw national attention to contentious issues. This article examines the history and effectiveness of such walkouts in Texas and other states like Oregon and Minnesota, where they have been used to protest issues from voting rights to abortion. While often successful in the short term, the strategy's long-term ability to permanently block legislation is limited if the governor can repeatedly call special sessions.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order in a Louisiana redistricting case suggests the conservative majority may be preparing to weaken or eliminate key protections against racial gerrymandering. In the case, *Louisiana v. Callais*, the Court has asked for briefings on whether a lower court's order to create a second Black-majority district violates the Constitution. This move indicates a potential challenge to the precedent set in *Thornburg v. Gingles*, which underpins the Voting Rights Act's power to combat racial vote dilution. This development casts doubt on the future of such legal challenges, despite the Court's recent ruling against a similar gerrymander in Alabama.</p>

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has stated that she feels the Republican party has lost touch with its base and is turning its back on the "America First" agenda. In recent interviews, she expressed deep frustration with GOP leadership, particularly House Speaker Mike Johnson, accusing the party of reverting to its "neocon" past. Despite her disillusionment, Greene confirmed that she has no plans to leave the party and will instead continue to push for policies she believes resonate with working-class Americans. Her comments reflect a broader dissatisfaction among some voters with the established political parties.</p>

          <p>Following a weak July jobs report, market sentiment is strengthening for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, a move that analysts believe would likely boost stock markets. The report is seen as clear evidence of a weakening economy, bolstering the case for monetary easing. In separate analysis, Morgan Stanley noted that major tech companies are projected to continue their massive spending on AI infrastructure, with capital expenditures expected to grow 56% in 2025. This sustained investment signals strong confidence in the long-term growth and profitability of artificial intelligence technologies across the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle surged over 20% after President Donald Trump publicly praised its new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney.

The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced criticism for being overly sexualized and a potential double entendre.

          <p>Student loan borrowers who were in the now-defunct SAVE plan face costly consequences if they remain in the associated payment pause. As of August 1, interest has resumed accruing, which could add hundreds of dollars to a typical borrower's debt each month. Furthermore, time spent in this forbearance does not count toward loan forgiveness, including for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Experts recommend that most borrowers actively switch to a new repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to avoid growing debt and to continue making progress toward eventual cancellation.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has faced ridicule after announcing its latest defection from the Conservative party: Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland. Before entering politics, Matthews authored numerous books on paranormal subjects, including ghosts, UFOs, and cryptozoology. Critics, including the prime minister's press secretary and a Labour source, mocked the move, with one suggesting it was no surprise that someone interested in the "fantastical and the unexplained" would be drawn to Reform's fiscal plans. Matthews used his introductory press conference to criticize the "wokeness" of the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the separation of church and state, a foundational principle of the U.S. First Amendment, is facing an unprecedented attack. The author contends that this principle has historically allowed both religion and government to thrive without impeding one another. However, recent legislative and judicial actions, such as using taxpayer money for religious education vouchers and efforts to post the Ten Commandments in schools, are eroding this vital boundary. The article concludes by questioning the wisdom of abandoning a system that has served the nation well for one that has caused conflict elsewhere.</p>
