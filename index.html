          <p>The BBC has stated it should have cut the live broadcast of Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance, during which the singer led chants of "death to the IDF." The broadcaster expressed regret for the incident, calling the sentiments "utterly unacceptable" and having no place on its airwaves. Following criticism from the government and festival organizers, the BBC is now reviewing its guidance for live events to prevent similar occurrences. UK media regulator Ofcom is also investigating why the comments were aired.</p>

Bock described the situation as "outrageous" and suggested it shows a lack of interest in discovering the truth.

          <p>Trade negotiations between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology companies. The decision came after President Trump suspended talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke by phone, agreeing to restart negotiations toward a new economic and security relationship. The move is seen by some analysts as a concession by Canada to appease the White House.</p>

          <p>A massive spending package championed by President Trump has cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate, passing by a narrow 51-49 vote. The bill's passage required last-minute vote changes from several Republican holdouts who had expressed concerns over its potential $3.9 trillion impact on the national debt. The legislation, which Democrats are attempting to delay by forcing a full reading, now moves to a final vote. It will also need to pass the House again, where it faces potential opposition from some Republicans.</p>

          <p>UEFA has postponed its decision on whether Crystal Palace can compete in next season's Europa League, a spot the club earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from multi-club ownership rules, as co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. The decision is now pending the outcome of Lyon's appeal against a demotion to Ligue 2 due to financial issues. If Lyon's appeal fails, they have agreed to relinquish their Europa League spot, which would clear the way for Palace.</p>

The author shares a personal journey with chronic sleeplessness to explore the condition's psychological and neurobiological roots, challenging the hectoring tone of public health messaging. The piece examines how factors like work culture, poverty, and caregiving contribute to a national sleep crisis that disproportionately affects certain populations. It also provides a nuanced look at treatments like CBT-I and medication, arguing for a more compassionate understanding of the disorder.</p>

A government-backed foundation plans to use AI to "revitalize" 100 classic kung fu films, including creating animated reinterpretations of iconic movies. This initiative highlights differing global views on AI's role in creative fields, as U.S. guilds and studios grapple with concerns over labor displacement and intellectual property.

The prosecution presented graphic testimony from 34 witnesses, alleging a pattern of sex trafficking, violence, and coercion enabled by his employees. The defense has admitted to bad behavior and domestic violence but argues the federal racketeering charges are exaggerated.

          <p>A recent boating accident on Lake Tahoe that claimed eight lives serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of ignoring weather warnings on large bodies of water. The author, a veteran boater, argues that the tragedy was preventable, as forecasts had predicted strong winds that should have kept recreational boaters ashore. The commentary refutes the idea that the storm was "sudden" or "unexpected," emphasizing that afternoon winds are common on the lake. The article offers practical safety advice, urging boaters to monitor forecasts closely and head for shore at the first sign of rough conditions.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are on the verge of becoming commercial products that could restore communication and mobility for people with paralysis. Companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink, Precision Neuroscience, and Synchron are developing implantable devices that decode brain signals to control computers or generate speech. While Neuralink has garnered significant public attention, its competitors are also making major strides, some with less invasive technology. These advancements promise to significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with conditions like spinal cord injuries or ALS.</p>

          <p>Backed by a Trump administration executive order promoting mineral independence, The Metals Company is pursuing a pioneering and controversial project to mine the Pacific Ocean floor. The firm aims to extract vast quantities of nickel and cobalt from polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, arguing it is less harmful than land-based mining. However, the plan faces strong opposition from scientists concerned about irreversible damage to a little-understood ecosystem. Dozens of countries also argue the U.S. has no right to unilaterally approve mining in international waters.</p>

While the ban has broad public support, some smokers feel the restrictions are excessive for outdoor spaces. The law, which includes fines for violators, does not currently apply to e-cigarettes, a point of criticism for some.</p>

          <p>This article offers advice for supporting someone with a cancer diagnosis, drawing on insights from survivors and patient advocates. Key recommendations include simply reaching out and being present, as social isolation is a common and painful experience for patients. It's better to ask and listen rather than talk, avoiding platitudes or comparisons to others. When offering help, be specific with suggestions like "Can I drop off a pizza?" instead of a vague "Let me know if you need anything." Support should also continue after treatment ends, as the recovery journey is often long.</p>
