The talks are being closely watched globally, as their outcome could significantly impact Ukraine's territorial integrity, European security, and geopolitical alliances. The agenda includes one-on-one discussions between the leaders, followed by a joint press conference, with both delegations featuring high-level officials from defense, foreign affairs, and finance ministries.

          <p>As the Social Security program celebrates its 90th anniversary, providing benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, concerns about its future financial stability are intensifying. The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034, which could lead to a 23% reduction in benefits if no legislative action is taken. Debates on how to shore up the program include proposals like lifting the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or raising the retirement age. Despite assurances from the Trump administration about protecting and improving the program's efficiency, public confidence has declined amid these mounting challenges.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal corruption charges following a multi-year investigation into her conduct. The indictment is linked to allegations that she accepted gifts, such as sports tickets and a cellphone, from a local businessman in exchange for official favors. The investigation also scrutinized an alleged affair with her police bodyguard, who is a co-defendant in the case. Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to be charged with federal crimes while still in office, adding a significant layer of political turmoil as her second term nears its end.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to challenge President Trump's executive order placing the city's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. The suit argues the action is an unlawful "hostile takeover" that infringes on the district's right to self-governance and requests a temporary restraining order to halt the directive. D.C. officials maintain that the president's justification, based on rising crime, is misleading as data shows a significant decrease in violent crime. The legal challenge names the president, the Attorney General, and the Department of Justice as defendants, escalating the conflict over local versus federal authority.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, tracking towards the northeastern Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. Forecasters have issued storm watches for several islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, warning of heavy rainfall, potential flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions. The storm is expected to strengthen further into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 4 strength, although current models predict it will curve northward and remain offshore from the U.S. mainland. Earlier in its formation off the African coast, the storm system caused deadly flash flooding in Cabo Verde.</p>

Drake's lawsuit accuses UMG, the parent company for both artists' labels, of defamation and deliberately promoting Lamar's track to his detriment. UMG's legal team argues that the lawsuit's premise—that Drake could only lose a rap battle due to a corporate conspiracy—is absurd.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation details the potential impact of President Trump's recent tax legislation, showing significant variation in benefits by state and income level. On average, taxpayers are projected to save $3,752 in 2026, with residents in states like Wyoming and Washington seeing the largest cuts, while states like Mississippi will see the smallest. The report also notes that high-income individuals in wealthy areas, such as resort towns, disproportionately skew the average savings upward. A separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests the legislation could increase resources for top earners while reducing them for lower-income households due to cuts in social programs.

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to resume its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

This ruling is a significant development in the administration's efforts to reshape the powerful consumer watchdog agency, which has returned over $21 billion to consumers since its inception.

The move would align with the administration's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S. While the structure of such a deal is uncertain, it could involve funds from the CHIPS Act to give the government a direct ownership interest.

The new studio is part of a 27,000-acre development owned by billionaire Ross Perot Jr.'s real estate company, Hillwood, which is also a partner in the project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comprehensive ranking of the many film and television adaptations based on the legal thrillers of author John Grisham. The list evaluates nine different productions, from classic 1990s films like "The Pelican Brief" and "The Firm" to more recent television series based on "The Rainmaker." Each adaptation is assessed on its quality, casting, and faithfulness to the spirit of Grisham's signature underdog stories. The ranking places Alan J. Pakula's "The Pelican Brief" at the top, praising its pacing and charismatic leads, while the 2012 TV version of "The Firm" is ranked last for failing to capture the propulsive nature of the original story.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades, with an area nearly three times larger than last year already burned across the continent. Countries including Spain, Portugal, Greece, and France are battling dozens of blazes fueled by record-breaking heatwaves, with temperatures frequently exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The fires have resulted in multiple deaths and forced thousands to evacuate, with Spain alone seeing an area the size of London destroyed. Climate scientists warn that these extreme events are becoming more common and that urgent action is needed to address the growing risk wildfires pose to populations and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has levied significant penalties against the University of Michigan's football program for a sign-stealing scheme that occurred from 2021 to 2023. The sanctions include a fine of approximately $30 million, four years of probation, and an extended suspension for head coach Sherrone Moore. Former coach Jim Harbaugh, now with the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers, received a 10-year show-cause penalty, which could hinder any future return to college coaching. Importantly, the university will not have to vacate any victories, including its 2023 national championship, and is not subject to a postseason ban, avoiding the most severe possible punishments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his second term, President Trump has reportedly shifted his approach to foreign policy, sidelining the traditional National Security Council process in favor of a small, core group of loyal advisers. Major decisions, such as those concerning Ukraine and Gaza, are now primarily made by figures like Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This centralized structure allows the president's personal instincts and priorities to drive U.S. policy more directly, but critics warn it also increases the risk of unintended consequences by limiting expert input and diverse viewpoints. The article uses the summit with Vladimir Putin as an example of a move that likely would have been counseled against under a more traditional advisory process.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental groups has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it secretly commissioned a climate report to justify rolling back key environmental regulations. The suit claims the Department of Energy assembled a panel of "known climate contrarians" to produce a report that downplays the risks of greenhouse gas emissions. This report was then allegedly used by the EPA as a scientific basis to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of carbon dioxide. The lawsuit argues this process violated federal transparency laws and that the report itself is full of scientific inaccuracies and misrepresentations.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives have introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force. The resolution, invoking the Home Rule Act of 1973, argues that the president has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required by law to justify such a takeover. Sponsors of the measure, including Representative Jamie Raskin, contend that the president's action is an unlawful power grab based on a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate. They assert that Congress has the authority to terminate the federal control and restore local governance to the district.</p>

In India-administered Kashmir, a remote village was devastated by flooding that killed at least 60 people, with many more still missing.

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The seismic activity is believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting cold water deep underground, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift. Officials state that these small, localized quakes do not pose a significant hazard compared to the major regional fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>

While the order is narrow, it has reportedly led to a significant reduction in immigration arrests in the city.
