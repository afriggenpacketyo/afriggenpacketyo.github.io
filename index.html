          <p>Japan is taking steps to mitigate the impact of U.S. President Trump's tariffs, including corporate financing support and stimulating consumption, as bilateral trade negotiations continue. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief negotiator, will visit Washington for a second round of talks following discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Survivors and families of victims of a 2005 West Japan Railway Co. train derailment offered prayers at an event marking the accident's anniversary on Friday, with some pledging to pass on lessons learned from the tragedy which killed 107 people. Additionally, a government survey revealed that 35% of local public servants in Japan have experienced abusive behavior from residents.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 01:57:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council, Sean Stein, suggests the U.S. may have less leverage in tariff negotiations with China than it believes, noting China has been preparing for this situation since 2018. Stein points out that China doesn't want to be perceived as being bullied and views the tariff policy as part of a broader US strategy to contain China's growth. He also notes that Washington's expectation that Beijing would initiate contact after the first round of tariffs was a misjudgment. These factors make a quick resolution to the trade dispute unlikely.</p>

The article also highlights the case of Jose Hermosillo, a U.S. citizen wrongfully detained, and Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder facing deportation for his activism. Critics argue that these policies are creating widespread fear and undermining civil liberties, with deportations down, but the fear of them increased.</p>

John Moe The posted his prediction on 9 April, just two weeks after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake killed 3,500 people and destroyed centuries-old temples in the South East Asian nation. He was arrested Tuesday for making "false statements with the intention of causing public panic", Myanmar's information ministry said. Experts say earthquakes are impossible to predict due to the complexity of the factors involved in such disasters.</p>

          <p>South Korea is seeking a trade deal with the U.S. by early July to avoid tariffs, requesting "calm" and "orderly" discussions on trade issues. During talks in Washington, D.C., South Korean officials proposed mutually beneficial solutions and expressed concerns about tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobile imports. The deal is reportedly being pursued before U.S. President Trump's 90-day tariff suspension ends.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have committed to restoring funding to the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), a major study on women’s health, following an outcry from scientists and experts. The WHI's findings have significantly influenced medical practices and clinical guidelines, preventing numerous cases of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. The National Institutes of Health “remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research, and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.”</p>
