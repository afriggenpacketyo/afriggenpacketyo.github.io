          <h2>Business Advocate Suggests US Overestimates Leverage in China Tariff Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, indicated that the United States may overestimate its leverage in tariff negotiations with China, suggesting Beijing has been preparing for this situation since 2018 and doesn't feel pressured to make a deal. Stein highlighted that China does not want to be perceived as being bullied on the world stage and views US tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain China's growth. This perspective suggests a quick resolution to the trade tensions is unlikely, as Beijing is prepared to weather the storm and resist external pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, marking the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first. The Jacksonville Jaguars made a notable trade to select two-way Colorado star Travis Hunter, while Shedeur Sanders surprisingly went undrafted in the first round. The draft saw a focus on offensive and defensive lines, with only two quarterbacks selected overall, contrasting with the previous year's quarterback-heavy draft. The event was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the first time, with rounds two and three scheduled for Friday.</p>

The U.S. views this move as particularly important in the Tri-Border Area, a financial hub for Hezbollah-linked operatives, and hopes it will help cut off the Iranian regime's ability to fund terrorism in Latin America.</p>

These samples are unique because they appear to be younger than those from Apollo missions, suggesting more recent volcanic activity on the Moon.
