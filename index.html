          <p>Facing potential new sanctions, President Putin has suggested direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, scheduled for May 15 in Istanbul, without preconditions, despite an ongoing military campaign. This proposal follows a visit by European leaders to Kyiv, where they advocated for a 30-day unconditional cease-fire and threatened intensified sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if Putin refuses. While Ukraine has not immediately responded to Putin's offer, Russian forces launched drone attacks on several Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, shortly after Putin's announcement. The competing proposals underscore the ongoing efforts by both Russia and Ukraine to portray themselves as seeking peace amidst international pressure to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at easing tensions arising from the trade war initiated by President Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Economists warn that the ongoing trade dispute could hinder global growth and increase inflation, potentially triggering a recession in the United States. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng are leading the talks for Washington and Beijing, respectively. While Mr. Trump has hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical that a quick deal is likely.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent emotional appeal for reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced deep divisions within the British royal family. This public airing of family tensions is overshadowing the King's efforts to establish his reign and potentially undermining the monarchy's image of unity. Royal experts suggest that unless Charles can resolve the rift with Harry, it may define his reign, conflicting with the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness he has long promoted. The ongoing family drama, combined with Prince Andrew's scandals, contributes to a sense of a diminished and divided royal family.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has sparked widespread anger and opposition in Iran, uniting diverse political, ideological, and religious factions. The name Persian Gulf has been used since ancient times, deeply ingrained in Iranian national and cultural identity. Despite Trump's ability to change geographical names within the United States, the move has been widely condemned by Iranians, including opposition figures, who view it as an insult to their history and civilization. The proposal could also negatively impact ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S.</p>

His transformation began with social media posts, leading to connections with Trump advisors and a role in promoting U.S.-Greenland relations.

          <p>Danny Dyer, the British actor, revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani while in rehab in 2016 motivated him to continue his treatment. Dyer, who gained fame in the film 'Human Traffic' and played Mick Carter in 'EastEnders,' spoke about how fame led to poor decisions and drug use. He described a turning point in 2013 when he took the role in 'EastEnders' due to financial struggles and later sought rehab after realizing the impact of his addiction on his family.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being freed from federal custody, expressing joy and gratitude despite her ordeal. She thanked supporters and affirmed her belief in the American justice system, despite the Trump administration's efforts to deport her following an opinion piece she wrote. Supporters say her detention was a violation of her First Amendment rights, while the government maintained it was due to her engaging 'in activities in support of Hamas'. Ozturk's case has drawn attention to the administration's crackdown on international students and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced a “total reset” in US-China trade relations after high-level talks in Geneva, aimed at resolving a trade war caused by his tariffs. While stating that discussions were "friendly" and "constructive," Trump provided no specific details on progress. The meeting between US and Chinese officials occurred amidst escalating tariffs, with the US imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with 125% duties on US goods. Analysts remain cautious about a breakthrough, despite Trump's suggestion of reducing tariffs to 80%.</p>

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, indicates that zongertinib outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication targets the HER2 protein and blocks the activity of the protein’s tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signalling cell growth. The study was conducted at 82 sites worldwide, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan, with Asian populations accounting for a majority of the patients.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are feeling the economic strain of President Trump's trade war, with border crossings and Canadian tourism plummeting. The implementation of tariffs has led Canadians to favor domestic spending, impacting businesses in towns like Port Huron, Michigan, which rely on cross-border traffic.
