          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, is experiencing unprecedented flooding from the Mendenhall Glacier. An "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin caused the Mendenhall River to crest at a record 16.65 feet, surpassing previous highs and forcing evacuations. This annual event, exacerbated by climate change, has prompted the installation of temporary barriers to protect homes, though a permanent solution is still years away. The incident highlights the growing and immediate risks posed by retreating glaciers in a warming climate.</p>

          <p>Richard Kim, a former executive at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has been indicted on fraud charges for allegedly misappropriating nearly $4 million from investors in his online casino startup, Zero Edge. Prosecutors claim he gambled away most of the funds on another crypto casino within a week, concealing the loss from investors, which included his former employer Galaxy Digital. Kim allegedly admitted his actions were wrong, attributing them to a gambling addiction, but now faces federal charges for securities and wire fraud. The case underscores significant risks within the loosely regulated crypto and startup investment sectors.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats, who left the state to break quorum and block a special legislative session, are now discussing their return. Their departure successfully stalled Republican efforts to pass new congressional maps that Democrats argue are unfairly gerrymandered. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to call another special session with the same agenda, while Republican House leaders plan to bill the Democrats for overtime security costs. The political standoff highlights the intense partisan battle over redistricting and voting rights in Texas.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will host this year's Kennedy Center Honors, a break from tradition, and revealed his deep involvement in selecting the recipients. He stated that he rejected potential nominees for being "too woke" or liberal, naming supporters like Sylvester Stallone among the chosen artists. This move is part of a broader effort by Trump to assert authority over cultural institutions, which has included replacing the center's board with loyalists. The actions have drawn criticism and prompted some performers, like the producers of "Hamilton," to pull out in protest.</p>

          <h2>Small-Cap Stocks Surge as Investors Rotate Away From Megacap Tech Giants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 15:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while megacap tech stocks, including the "Magnificent 7," saw a downturn. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower borrowing costs are expected to disproportionately benefit smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on financing for growth and operations. The shift suggests investors are repositioning portfolios in anticipation of a new phase in monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's decision to federalize Washington D.C.'s police and deploy the National Guard, framing it as an authoritarian move rather than a genuine response to crime. The author argues the action serves to distract from other issues and energize his base by playing on racist tropes about "Democrat-run" multiracial cities. The move is presented as part of a larger pattern to consolidate power and create a personalized state apparatus. It calls for media and political actors to recognize these actions as a consistent, cumulative attack on democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of cargo in July, handling over one million container units for the first time in its 117-year history. This surge was driven by shippers front-loading goods from China to get ahead of impending tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While the port managed the volume without delays, logistics experts note that the peak season started and slowed earlier than normal. The data indicates that uncertainty over trade policy is significantly altering supply chain behavior and creating volatility for importers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move comes as rising tariffs spark renewed concerns about inflation and higher consumer prices. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded discount was one of its most requested benefits from employees. The decision could serve multiple purposes: easing the financial burden on its workforce, boosting employee morale and retention, and encouraging its own staff to shop more at Walmart stores.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders held a virtual conference before Trump's high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. During the call, Zelenskyy warned that Putin is "bluffing" and does not genuinely want peace, urging allies to maintain pressure and sanctions on Russia. Trump reportedly told the leaders there would be "very severe consequences" if the war continues and suggested a follow-up meeting involving both Putin and Zelenskyy. The discussions highlight Kyiv's and Europe's deep concerns that they could be sidelined in any deal struck between the U.S. and Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century due to climate change, with North American caribou facing the highest risk of an 80% drop. Researchers used ancient DNA and computer models to show that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses a more severe threat. The decline is not only a threat to the species but also has wider ecological implications, as reindeer help maintain tundra plant diversity. The findings underscore the cascading effects of climate change on Arctic ecosystems.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payment network. The suit alleges that EWS designed Zelle without critical safety features, which enabled scammers to steal over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims EWS knew its platform was susceptible to fraud but failed to implement basic safeguards or enforce anti-fraud rules on its partner banks. Zelle has called the lawsuit a "political stunt," stating that over 99.95% of its transactions are free of fraud reports.</p>

The Premier League had previously floated a "39th game" concept in 2008 but shelved it after strong criticism from fans.

While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires persistence, preparation, and a solid understanding of debt laws. The article warns of potential pitfalls, such as a lack of negotiation strategy and the risk of costly missteps regarding taxes on forgiven debt and credit score impacts. It advises that successful self-negotiation is a complex, high-stakes process. (not investment advice)</p>

It notes that while Nixon was pro-business, he still established the EPA and protected endangered species. The piece suggests that the current political climate is forcing environmental groups to reconsider their strategies and alliances. They must now navigate an administration that appears to view environmentalism as fundamentally at odds with economic progress, requiring new tactics to achieve their goals.</p>
