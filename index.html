          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, advocating for enhanced artificial intelligence cooperation among member states and rejecting a "Cold War mentality." Speaking to over 20 foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Xi positioned China as a global peacemaker amid persistent trade tensions with the U.S. and other international conflicts. He announced substantial Chinese investments and educational support for SCO countries, aiming to chart a new phase of high-quality development and cooperation.

          <p>BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell sharply after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a 30% decline in second-quarter net profit, despite a 14% revenue growth driven by overseas sales. This profitability slump is attributed to an aggressive and ongoing price war within China's domestic EV industry, which has seen retail car prices drop significantly over the past two years. The company's mid-year earnings filing highlighted the adverse impact of this competition, prompting Chinese authorities to warn against further price cuts. This article indicates BYD's strategy to expand into new global markets to mitigate intense domestic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) unexpectedly returned to growth in August, reaching 50.5 and surpassing economist estimates. This expansion, the fastest since March, was driven by a recovery in new orders and export business, partly attributed to an extended trade-war truce with the U.S. Despite this, the article highlights muted gains in overall output and new orders, suggesting persistent weak domestic demand. While overall business confidence improved, employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak for the fifth straight month, indicating a fragile and potentially unsustainable recovery dependent on export stability and domestic demand.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came in response to reports of children being prepared for immediate repatriation to Guatemala, where lawyers argued they faced risks of abuse and persecution. While the Guatemalan President and U.S. Justice Department claimed these were family reunifications, advocacy groups contested the validity of consent in some cases. This article details the legal challenge, asserting violations of federal laws designed to protect unaccompanied minors, with the order remaining in place for 14 days to prevent irreparable harm.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding its broad investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files. A committee spokesperson confirmed that Mueller has health issues precluding his testimony, with his family revealing he is battling Parkinson's disease.

          <p>A report has found that Australia could use various technologies to implement its social media ban for under-16s, but all methods carry inherent risks or shortcomings. The government's ban, effective in December, aims to limit social media's harmful impacts on children, requiring platforms to prevent underage accounts and deactivate existing ones. While identity document verification is deemed most accurate, it raises significant data privacy concerns, and facial assessment technology has accuracy limitations for the target age group. This article suggests a "layered" approach for robust enforcement, despite concerns from experts about privacy, potential false positives/negatives, and the risk of pushing children to less-regulated online spaces.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has significantly redecorated the Oval Office, applying what he calls "Trump touches" that include extensive gold detailing across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace. This article analyzes the transformation, noting the multiplication of gold trophies, vases, and presidential paintings, with the gold reportedly paid for personally by Trump. While some White House aides described it as a "golden office for the golden age," critics have likened the revamped office to a "professional wrestler’s dressing room," calling it vulgar and gaudy. The changes reflect a long tradition of presidents personalizing the space, but Trump's aesthetic has been particularly distinctive.</p>
