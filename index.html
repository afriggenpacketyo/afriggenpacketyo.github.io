          <p>China is proceeding with a monumental 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet, considered one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects. The line will traverse extreme terrain, including glaciers and permafrost, at an average altitude over 4,500 meters, requiring immense engineering prowess. With an estimated cost potentially reaching US$56.2 billion, the project underscores Beijing's strategic focus on integrating and developing its western regions, despite the significant financial and construction hurdles involved.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the former lead singer of the band Lostprophets, has died after being attacked in HMP Wakefield, where he was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses. West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men on suspicion of murder following the incident. Watkins, 48, was jailed in 2013 for crimes a judge described as plunging to "new depths of depravity," including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The attack occurs shortly after a report highlighted a marked increase in violence at the prison.</p>

          <p>President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar has announced that an "attempt to seize power illegally and by force" is underway in the country. The warning follows an incident where a faction of soldiers left their barracks to join thousands of anti-government protesters in the capital, Antananarivo. The protests, initially started by the youth-led Gen Z movement over utility shortages, have escalated into broader demands for political change amid deadly crackdowns by security forces. The government has stated it remains firm but is open to dialogue with all parties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a measure aimed at protecting its struggling domestic industry from global overproduction. This move is seen by some as a protectionist step similar to US policies, while the EU frames it as a WTO-compliant system that still allows for a substantial volume of tariff-free imports. The decision is also interpreted as a strategic effort to gain leverage and seek concessions from the United States regarding its own steep tariffs on European steel.</p>

          <p>Car dealerships across China are experiencing a severe financial squeeze, with many operating at significant losses and facing potential failure within two years. The industry's major participants saw a 10% sales decline in the first half of 2025, a continuation of a downward trend from the previous year. This crisis is attributed to a fierce price war among manufacturers and growing competition from e-commerce platforms, prompting calls for financial support from banks to stabilize the crucial auto distribution sector.

          <p>The European Union is gradually implementing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will replace passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. The system requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first entry, with the registration remaining valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential delays and queues during the initial rollout phase, which will continue until full implementation in April 2026.</p>

The move, which was initially misrepresented by some media as granting "extra holidays," reflects Germany's broader efforts to accommodate its evolving religious demographics within a framework of state-regulated public holidays.

This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized egg cells. The findings, published in the journal Cell, offer profound insights into the fundamental processes of life and could have major implications for agriculture and plant science.</p>

Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak is still integrating into the team, and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko has shown flashes of promise.

Pundits argue that his consistent, high-level performance and all-around game, including his ability to create plays, are sometimes undervalued compared to other top strikers.

          <p>Prince Andrew is facing renewed public condemnation after a leaked email from 2011 suggests he maintained contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he publicly admitted. The message, in which he reportedly told Epstein "we are in this together," directly contradicts his claims in a 2019 BBC interview that he had severed ties in 2010. This revelation has amplified calls for King Charles to take further action, such as stripping Andrew of his remaining titles, though the monarchy's options to fully distance itself from the disgraced prince are complex and limited.</p>

          <p>University of Southern California's football team secured a significant 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, powered by an unexpected breakout performance from walk-on running back King Miller.

His performance, combined with a strong defensive effort that stifled Michigan's offense, provided a statement win for the Trojans and bolstered their standing in the college football landscape.</p>

          <p>Beijing has sharply criticized Washington for employing "double standards" after the US threatened to impose new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and control exports of critical software. China's Ministry of Commerce warned it would take resolute measures to protect its interests if the US proceeds. The threat from Washington came a day after Beijing announced its own new export limits on rare earth minerals, which are vital for technology and defense industries. China defended its export controls as necessary for national security amid global instability, escalating the ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>An Indiana woman, Alison Davis, has been found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, after a trial that centered on conflicting expert testimony about his death. Prosecutors alleged she beat him to death and staged the scene to look like an accident, pointing to multiple skull fractures. However, the defense successfully argued that Kevin, who was intoxicated, tragically fell down a steep, narrow staircase, with a single impact against a banister post causing the catastrophic injuries. The jury acquitted Alison after just six hours of deliberation, ending a 17-month ordeal that began with her arrest.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to face the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series, a matchup that presents several key challenges. The Brewers built their successful season on a disciplined, small-ball offensive approach, ranking high in on-base percentage and stolen bases rather than home runs. Their pitching staff is a major strength, boasting the second-best team ERA in the majors, led by ace Freddy Peralta and a deep, effective bullpen. Having been swept by Milwaukee twice in the regular season, the Dodgers will need to find a way to counter this well-rounded and resilient team.</p>

          <p>Austin Beutner, the former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, is planning to run for mayor in 2026, challenging incumbent Karen Bass. Beutner is framing his campaign around what he calls a "failure of leadership" by the current administration, citing issues like crime, housing costs, and specifically the city's flawed response to the devastating Palisades fire. As a former investment banker and philanthropist with deep ties to the city, Beutner represents the first serious challenger to Mayor Bass as she seeks her second term.</p>
