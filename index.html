          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:19:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing significant economic uncertainty stemming from ongoing trade disputes, particularly with the United States. This pause follows four consecutive rate cuts earlier in the year, as the ECB assesses geopolitical volatility and its impact on the eurozone economy. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while the economy performed better than expected in the first quarter, risks to growth are tilted to the downside. The bank remains vigilant, keeping all policy options open as it monitors inflation and the potential effects of global tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant premarket drop after the company reported its second straight quarter of declining auto sales, with automotive revenue falling 16% year-over-year. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that Tesla could face "a few rough quarters" due to expiring EV tax credits and increasing competition from lower-cost manufacturers in Europe and China. The company did not provide official guidance for the year, leading some analysts to interpret this as a signal that management no longer forecasts volume growth for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as backyard cottages. The legislation would authorize FHA insurance for second mortgages specifically for ADU construction and allow government-sponsored enterprises to purchase these loans, addressing a significant financing gap. While the bill aims to boost housing supply amid a national shortage, its effectiveness will still depend on local zoning laws, which often restrict or ban ADU construction.</p>

          <p>A passenger plane crash in Russia's Far East has resulted in the deaths of all 48 people on board, including five children. The An-24 aircraft, operated by Angara Airlines, disappeared from radar before its wreckage was found burning in a remote forest. Authorities have cited adverse weather conditions and the aircraft's age of nearly 50 years as potential factors in the tragedy. An investigation into flight safety violations has been initiated amid a recent increase in aviation incidents in the country.</p>

          <p>Despite its capability to control the flow of illicit substances, China has not taken comprehensive action to stop the export of fentanyl precursors to Mexican cartels, which fuels the U.S. opioid crisis. This article suggests Beijing's cooperation fluctuates with the state of U.S.-China relations, using the crisis as a bargaining chip for concessions like tariff relief. While China cracked down on finished fentanyl exports under pressure from the Trump administration, its criminal networks simply switched to shipping the raw ingredients. This strategic inaction demonstrates how the regime prioritizes political leverage over addressing a global health crisis.</p>

The conflict was reportedly triggered by a mine explosion that injured Thai soldiers, prompting Bangkok to withdraw its ambassador.

          <p>A comprehensive study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable goal than the commonly cited 10,000, can significantly boost brainpower and lower the risk of serious health issues. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, linked this step count to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, dementia, and depression. Researchers note that the 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence.

          <p>This article explores the concept of “citizenship insecurity,” a feeling of estrangement from one's own country's values, which some Americans are experiencing due to the current political climate. This sentiment is not about immediate physical danger but a sense of disillusionment with the nation's direction, leading some to seek second passports. The feeling is particularly acute for marginalized groups who feel more vulnerable, but it also affects others who no longer trust the country's ideals. This trend signals a deep societal unraveling and a loss of faith in the American identity for a growing number of its citizens.</p>

The decision suggests the bank is confident in its progress against inflation, which has been decreasing but remained over 35% in June.

          <p>In a highly unusual move, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, intensifying his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades, breaking with the tradition of respecting the Fed's political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he could fire the chairman. The visit is a symbolic escalation of this conflict, bringing the president's criticism directly to the institution he has targeted.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party and now an Independent MP, has confirmed the launch of a new political party. In a joint statement with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, he called for a "real, democratic alternative" to the current political system. The new party, which is not yet officially named or registered, aims to stand candidates in local elections next year. Its platform is expected to focus on wealth redistribution, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel, positioning it to the left of the current Labour Party.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting between Ghislaine Maxwell and the Department of Justice, a 2022 sentencing memorandum from federal prosecutors offers a stark assessment of her character. The document described Maxwell as engaging in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct," showing a complete failure to accept responsibility for her "monstrous" crimes. Prosecutors argued she was a vital participant in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of teenage girls, using her position to groom and exploit victims.

The statement expresses deep concern for these local reporters, who are now facing the same dire humanitarian conditions as the population they cover, including a severe lack of food.

          <p>Despite a market rebound after an initial shock from tariff announcements, investors should expect continued volatility, according to a chief investment strategist at BlackRock. While the market has priced in mid-teen tariff rates and seems to believe the U.S. economy can absorb them, the threat of reinstated blanket tariffs still looms. The bull case for stocks relies on strong corporate fundamentals and a potential shift in focus away from chaotic policy headlines. However, uncertainty about who will ultimately bear the cost of tariffs could lead to abrupt market swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has imposed a 17 percent tariff on Mexican tomatoes, which is likely to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. Mexico is a primary source of year-round tomatoes for American supermarkets, especially varieties like cherry and roma tomatoes grown in greenhouses for better quality. While the U.S. grows its own tomatoes, particularly in Florida, it cannot supply the entire country year-round at current prices. Agricultural economists predict the tariff's cost will largely be passed on to consumers, making the already bland out-of-season tomatoes more expensive.</p>

          <p>This article examines the evolution of American summer camps, suggesting a shift from general, recreation-focused activities to more specialized, shorter sessions driven by parental anxieties. Historically, camps aimed to build character in nature, but today's camps often focus on specific skills like coding or are viewed as an extension of the high-pressure school year. This change, influenced by millennial parents' focus on achievement, may contribute to kids' reluctance to attend. The trend toward shorter, one-week sessions can also make it more challenging for campers to form deep friendships and a sense of community.</p>
