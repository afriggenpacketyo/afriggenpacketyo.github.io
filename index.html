          <p>A memorial service for assassinated right-wing activist Charlie Kirk featured emotional eulogies from prominent conservative figures, including Donald Trump Jr. In his speech, Trump Jr. described Kirk as being "like a little brother" and framed his death as a martyrdom, urging the audience to become "a million more Charlies" to continue his work. The address concluded with a call-and-response, asking the crowd if they would surrender or back down in fear, to which they responded with a resounding "no." The event was also attended by President Trump and Elon Musk, who watched from a secure suite.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and autism, according to reports. Federal health officials may advise pregnant women to avoid the painkiller unless necessary for a fever, a move that has drawn significant concern from Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue. The company stated that decades of research show no credible evidence for such a link and warned of the health risks if pregnant women avoid one of the few safe fever-reducing options available. This development follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on investigating the causes of autism.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been taken into federal custody after allegedly firing at least three rounds into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident, which occurred on Friday afternoon, is being investigated as a drive-by shooting and resulted in no injuries. After being briefly released on bail following his initial arrest by local police, Hernandez-Santana was re-arrested by the FBI on a federal charge. The motive remains under investigation, though the shooting follows recent controversy surrounding ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after comments about Charlie Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing and a separate deadly shootout in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro urged Americans to universally condemn political violence regardless of its source. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and called for healing and unity over division. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including the firebombing of the governor's mansion in April, to emphasize that such acts leave lasting scars on society. Shapiro stressed the legal distinction between protected, though often offensive, political speech and illicit incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's milestone 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto made a unique request to the Los Angeles Angels star. In addition to receiving three signed bats and two signed baseballs, Alberto asked if he and Trout could play catch on the field. The three-time MVP readily agreed, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family who were in attendance.

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young prevented a near-certain extra-base hit with a juggling, 'hacky-sack' style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss dropped the Mets into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final playoff spot.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. While the storm's center is projected to pass east of Bermuda without any current watches or warnings for land, its effects will be felt along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that swells generated by Gabrielle will create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada early this week. Forecasters noted that the storm could undergo rapid strengthening over the next couple of days as it moves through the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim measure. In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that halting the annual production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons would be a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could be leveraged to resume talks, which broke down in 2019. Lee's pragmatic approach aims to reduce regional tensions and establish a more stable path toward long-term peace.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 and passenger capacity to 80 million. While the government has championed the project as a "no-brainer for growth," it faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions. The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate these impacts.</p>

Traffic collisions are the primary cause of death for Southern California's mountain lions, whose habitats are heavily fragmented by roads.

A key sticking point for Democrats is the inclusion of an extension for the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, a demand Republicans are unlikely to meet.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend where Piastri uncharacteristically struggled. Piastri crashed in qualifying and again early in the race, failing to score any points. Norris, however, could only manage a seventh-place finish after a difficult qualifying session where he hit a wall, a result he attributed to track conditions and strategic decisions. While Norris viewed it as a missed opportunity, the weekend highlighted the intense pressure of the title fight and allowed Red Bull's Max Verstappen to close the points gap.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, aiming to build new momentum for a two-state solution. The announcement drew immediate and harsh criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "reward to terror" and insisted a Palestinian state would not be established. The largely symbolic but historic decision marks a significant shift, particularly for the UK, and reflects growing international pressure to find a political resolution to the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict amid the devastating war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration reportedly shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar," according to multiple sources. The probe involved an FBI sting operation in which Homan was allegedly recorded accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking future government contracts. The investigation, which began during the previous administration, was closed after internal discussions, raising concerns among some officials about the potential politicization of the Justice Department. Top DOJ officials stated that a full review found no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director in the first Trump administration, stated that the U.S. job market has clearly degraded, citing a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn explained that companies are cutting labor costs to protect their margins amid rising input costs, moving from a period of "hoarding labor" to aggressively managing expenses. He noted that this trend is showing up in the data and was a factor in the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over a new Pentagon directive that severely curtails journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters. The new rules, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, require reporters to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release. When asked about the policy, Trump commented, "Nothing stops reporters. You know that." The restrictions, which also limit reporters' physical movement within the Pentagon, have been denounced by press freedom advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism and an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication.</p>

          <p>A section of London's bustling Oxford Street was closed to traffic for one day as part of a trial for a permanent pedestrianization plan. Mayor Sadiq Khan, who visited the event, hailed it as "the day the fight back began to rescue this street," envisioning a future with increased footfall and space for outdoor events. The proposal aims to ban vehicles from the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. However, the plan has faced opposition from some local councillors and residents who are concerned about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

The German Eurofighters and Swedish Gripen jets monitored and photographed the aircraft in international airspace before the encounter ended without incident. The interception comes amid heightened alert among NATO and EU nations regarding Russian military and surveillance activities in the region, following recent incursions into Estonian airspace.</p>

Macron called the ambassador's published letter an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat," stating that such public criticism oversteps diplomatic boundaries. In his letter, Kushner had linked France's foreign policy, including gestures toward recognizing a Palestinian state, to a rise in violence against Jewish people in France. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner in a formal rebuke for interfering in the country's internal affairs.</p>

Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights, stating it has "no indication yet" when a secure version of the system will be functional again.

The team finished with a total of five medals—two silvers and three bronzes—matching their 2019 tally but falling short of expectations set after strong showings at recent Olympics and World Championships. The disappointing outcome was compounded by injuries to key athletes like defending 1500m champion Josh Kerr.
