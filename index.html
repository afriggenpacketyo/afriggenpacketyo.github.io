            <p>As trade tensions escalate between China and the United States, Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged officials to foster positive market expectations to mitigate risks and challenges.

            <h2>Small Nuclear Reactors Not a Solution for California's Energy Needs, Argues Contributor</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 06:03:41 EDT</div>

            <p>An opinion piece argues against the hype surrounding small modular reactors (SMRs) as a solution for California's energy needs, citing their high costs and historical failures. The author, who has analyzed nuclear power since 1993, contends that SMRs are even less economically viable than large reactors, especially with tariffs and competition from cheaper renewable energy sources. The article points to the high costs of existing nuclear plants and the increasing affordability of solar, wind, and battery storage as reasons to focus on those alternatives instead. The author suggests that SMRs are another overhyped energy technology that will lead to wasted resources.</p>

            <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port in Yemen, controlled by Houthi rebels, reportedly resulted in dozens of casualties, according to Houthi sources. Central Command stated the strikes aimed to eliminate a fuel source for the Houthis and deprive them of revenue used to destabilize the region. The Houthis and Iran condemned the U.S. action, with the Houthis calling it a violation of Yemen's sovereignty and Iran decrying it as an act of aggression. The U.S. also accused a Chinese satellite company of aiding Houthi attacks, further internationalizing the conflict.</p>

While other regional airports have seen an increase in passenger counts, LAX's numbers have dipped below forecasts, leading to revisions in future budget plans.

            <p>An opinion piece discusses Harvard's refusal to comply with what are described as illegal demands from the Trump administration, framing it as an important act of resistance. The author argues that universities must unite and develop a shared litigation strategy to combat the government's divide-and-rule tactics. The article criticizes the administration's use of moral panic about 'woke' and pro-Palestinian protests as a pretext to undermine institutions that encourage critical thinking. It calls for a defense of academic freedom and a rejection of totalitarian social engineering in the name of viewpoint diversity.</p>

            <p>The Lyrid meteor shower is set to peak on Earth Day, offering stargazers a celestial display. California is expected to have some of the best viewing conditions, though light pollution in major cities may hinder visibility. Experts recommend heading to the mountains or desert for a clearer view, emphasizing the importance of patience and minimizing distractions like cell phones. Despite the event's name, viewers are unlikely to see more than one meteor a minute, but even a single shooting star can be a special experience.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly targeting immigrants, including those with legal status, for expressing views that the government opposes and for simply following established procedures, such as filing taxes. This has led to arrests during scheduled immigration appointments and the sharing of confidential IRS data with immigration authorities. These actions are undermining trust in the government and pushing immigrants further into the shadows, with potential consequences for public safety. The article argues that the administration is creating a tiered citizenship system where immigrants are a permanent underclass with limited rights.</p>

            <p>Kensington and Chelsea Council is facing criticism for attempting to sell 14 properties purchased to house survivors of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, as the properties are in such poor condition that they cannot be rented out. The council admitted it knowingly took risks to purchase the properties quickly in 2017 to provide housing for displaced residents. Survivors and advocacy groups are condemning the council's actions, citing them as an example of failures in the aftermath of the disaster. The council plans to reinvest the proceeds from the sales back into social housing.</p>

            <p>A batch of lercanidipine, a common drug for high blood pressure, has been recalled after some packs were incorrectly labelled as containing 10mg tablets when they actually contain 20mg pills. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is urging patients taking the medication to check their packs and contact their GP or pharmacist if they have the wrongly-labelled medication. While the incorrect strength is printed on the face of the affected packs, the correct dose is printed on the blister strips inside and on the side of some of the boxes. The NHS advises that taking too high a dose of lercanidipine can cause dizziness and sleepiness.</p>

The report highlights that the UK is one of only three countries to rely upon self-reporting of visual conditions and the only European country to issue licenses without visual checks up to the age of 70.
