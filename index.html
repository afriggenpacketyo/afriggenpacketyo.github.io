          <p>An aid distribution in Gaza, designated as 'women only' to ensure safety, descended into chaos and tragedy, resulting in the deaths of at least two women. Witnesses described overcrowding, the use of pepper spray and stun grenades by security, and ultimately, fatal shootings by Israeli troops. This incident highlights the extreme dangers Palestinians face while trying to access humanitarian supplies, with the UN reporting over 1,000 deaths near aid points since a new distribution system was implemented in May. The Israeli military stated it fired 'warning shots' at approaching suspects but was unaware of casualties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is reportedly employing an artificial intelligence tool to identify federal regulations for elimination, aiming to cut 50% of them within a year of a potential second Trump term. According to internal documents, the 'Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool' analyzes government rules to find those no longer required by law, with some agencies allegedly already using it to make decisions on thousands of regulatory sections. The White House has confirmed that 'all options are being explored' to fulfill deregulation promises, describing the effort as a 'never-before-attempted transformation of government systems.'

          <h2>Arrest of Varna's Mayor Sparks Protests and Concerns Over Bulgarian Democracy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 11:43:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The arrest of Varna's reformist mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, on corruption charges has triggered widespread protests across Bulgaria, with citizens voicing concerns about authoritarianism and the politicization of the justice system. Demonstrators allege the case is part of a broader campaign by the ruling conservative party, GERB, to target political opponents, using the public prosecutor's office as a weapon. The accusations against Kotsev rely heavily on a witness allegedly close to GERB, and another key witness has since recanted his statement, claiming it was made under pressure.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his substantial overall lead. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever stage victory after a solo attack, all eyes were on Pogačar, who finished with the main group of riders. With only the final, traditionally processional stage into Paris remaining, the 26-year-old Slovenian's overall victory is considered secure, barring any unforeseen incidents. His performance solidifies his dominance in the world of professional cycling.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, previously a self-described 'raging bull' on Netflix, has expressed new concerns about the streaming giant's long-term growth, despite a strong recent earnings report. He points to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. Rogers suggests that while Netflix still dominates in hit shows, its ability to drive price increases and fund new programming is tied to user engagement, which appears to be flagging. He also notes that AI could be a 'double-edged sword,' helping Netflix with efficiency but also empowering independent creators on rival platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others contained high concentrations, suggesting PFAS were intentionally used in manufacturing.

While bipartisan support helped save its current funding, PEPFAR's congressional authorization has expired, and the administration has proposed major cuts for next year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their quality and make you more influential. This brief moment of forethought allows you to consider topics, questions, and goals before your brain becomes occupied with the cognitive load of real-time interaction, such as listening and formulating responses. By brainstorming beforehand, you can appear more prepared, considerate, and present during the chat. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and enhance communication skills in both personal and professional settings.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. Ten women, who all achieved high scores on their university entrance exams, were accepted into the prestigious military institution. The academy, founded in 1953, is responsible for training the personnel who operate China's fleet of nuclear and conventional submarines. This historic move marks a significant, albeit small, step towards gender integration within one of the most demanding branches of the Chinese military.</p>

Factors like a high cost of living, poor healthcare access, and the risk of natural disasters like hurricanes significantly lowered the scores for many of these states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's frantic efforts to deflect attention from his past association with Jeffrey Epstein are failing and may represent a serious political vulnerability. The author notes that new details about their relationship, combined with the administration's reversal on releasing Epstein-related files, have angered even parts of Trump's base. The article speculates on several outcomes, including the story fizzling out, a deal being struck with Ghislaine Maxwell for a controlled information release, or the scandal significantly harming Republicans in upcoming elections. It concludes that the issue is resonating because it involves powerful people acting behind closed doors.</p>

While the Mossad has not officially confirmed its connection to the account, the profile has been engaging in psychological warfare and satirical jabs aimed at the Iranian regime for several months, often soliciting information from Iranians.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams recently joked that she returned to competition 'for the insurance,' a comment that resonated widely and shed light on the challenges of the U.S. healthcare system. As an athlete with an on-and-off work schedule and pre-existing health conditions, Williams' situation exemplifies how difficult it can be to secure consistent, affordable coverage when not actively employed. The article explains concepts like COBRA, which allows individuals to keep their employer's plan but at a much higher personal cost. Her experience serves as a relatable, high-profile example of the 'job lock' many Americans face due to health insurance being tied to employment.</p>

The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature, where an opposition coalition currently holds the majority. The recall was initiated by citizens angry over the opposition's blocking of key legislation, including defense spending, and passing laws seen as favoring Beijing.

In June, 15% of homes under contract fell through, the highest rate for that month since 2017, as financially stretched buyers are more willing to walk away over issues like repairs. Simultaneously, sellers with significant equity and low mortgage rates are often unwilling to lower their prices or make concessions, choosing instead to pull their homes off the market.
