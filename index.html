          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration order that had halted work on the Revolution Wind project, a major offshore wind farm located off the coast of New England. The Danish energy company Orsted announced it will restart construction as soon as possible on the nearly completed project. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry, which it has criticized as being too expensive and unreliable. The Revolution Wind farm is expected to provide power to over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut once it becomes fully operational.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has been removed as a patron or ambassador from six different charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decisions came after a 2011 email surfaced in which she referred to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." The email appeared to contradict her previous public statements denouncing her association with him as a "gigantic error of judgement." A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent in an attempt to mitigate a legal threat from Epstein, and that she continues to regret any connection to him.</p>

He highlighted its low valuation compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions, projecting significant potential growth for the stock in the coming years. The endorsement caused a massive intraday rally for the company's shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown deadline just days away, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has criticized Democrats for what he calls "cold-blooded partisan" tactics in funding negotiations. Both parties blocked each other's short-term funding proposals last week, leaving little time to reach an agreement before the September 30 deadline. Republicans are pushing for a "clean" extension, while Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, insist that expiring Obamacare subsidies must be addressed in the current bill. The impasse has led to accusations from both sides, with Democrats blaming former President Trump's influence for the Republican strategy of refusing to negotiate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a planned announcement by the Trump administration linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism, medical experts and the drug's manufacturer are strongly refuting the claim. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stated there is no credible scientific evidence for such a link, citing over a decade of research. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical professionals have also pushed back, warning that such claims could cause pregnant women to avoid the safest available pain reliever for conditions like high fever, which itself poses risks to fetal development.

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has stated that his team faced an "unfair advantage" in their recent match against Arsenal due to the Premier League's scheduling. City had only 66 hours to prepare for the crucial game following a Champions League match, whereas Arsenal had a significantly longer rest period after their European fixture. Silva argued that for such important matches between top rivals, there should be more common sense applied to the scheduling to ensure both teams are in optimal condition. His comments echo previous complaints from manager Pep Guardiola, who has also criticized the demanding schedule placed on English teams competing in Europe.</p>

          <p>The annual spectacle of fall foliage is being delayed by the effects of climate change, with warmer temperatures pushing back the peak color season by about a week compared to historical averages. Experts note that while weather conditions in the spring and summer impact the vibrancy of the colors, rising fall temperatures are the primary driver for the later onset of the change. Leaf-peeping tourism is a multi-billion dollar industry, particularly in New England, and the shifting timeline presents new challenges for predicting the best viewing times. Scientists advise that while online maps provide general guidance, local conditions like elevation and rainfall cause significant variation in when and where the most brilliant colors appear.</p>

The airline has cited a decline in demand for domestic leisure travel as a primary reason for its financial difficulties, as budget-conscious consumers cut back on spending.

          <p>American parents are currently navigating a landscape of mixed and often contradictory messaging regarding childhood vaccinations, leading to confusion and uncertainty. Recent actions by a CDC advisory panel, including delaying a vote on the timing of the hepatitis B vaccine and stopping a universal recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine, have diverged from long-standing practices. This has prompted organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue their own, differing recommendations for the first time in decades. The situation is further complicated as some states form coalitions to encourage widespread vaccination while others, like Florida, plan to roll back vaccine mandates entirely.</p>

          <p>More than 400 prominent actors, musicians, and directors have co-signed an open letter organized by the ACLU, condemning the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel as a "dark moment for freedom of speech." The suspension by ABC followed pressure from the Trump administration after Kimmel's monologue criticized the political response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Signatories include major stars like Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The letter argues that the government is resorting to threats against journalists and entertainers to silence critics, a tactic that runs counter to constitutional values and sets a dangerous precedent for free expression in the nation.</p>

          <p>This editorial analyzes Donald Trump's recent statement at a memorial for activist Charlie Kirk, where he declared, "I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them." The article argues this admission clarifies his political approach, which seeks not just to challenge but to delegitimize and silence dissent, blurring the lines between truth and falsehood for political gain. The piece suggests that this weaponization of speech and state power creates a chilling climate where citizens fear reprisal for expressing their views. It contrasts the American ideal of robust public debate with a model where allies are rewarded and the conditions for honest dialogue are deliberately eroded.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs not paid by Original Medicare, but premiums vary significantly based on location, plan type, and personal factors. In 2025, monthly premiums can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for the most comprehensive coverage. On average, most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level options like Plan G or Plan N. To secure lower costs, experts advise enrolling as soon as one is eligible to avoid penalties for pre-existing conditions, comparing quotes from multiple insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing for lower monthly premiums.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cancels Annual USDA Survey on Food Insecurity in America</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it will discontinue its long-standing annual survey on household food insecurity, labeling the report "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." For 30 years, the survey has provided crucial data on the number of Americans struggling to access adequate food, informing policy and anti-hunger advocacy efforts. Anti-hunger organizations like the Food Research and Action Center have condemned the decision, stating that without this data, policymakers will be "flying blind" in their efforts to combat hunger. The move comes after the administration expanded work requirements for food aid, which is projected to increase food insecurity.</p>

          <p>A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3 struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking many residents. The quake was centered just east of Berkeley, and while it was felt widely across the region, there have been no immediate reports of major damage or injuries. The shaking prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing systemwide delays for commuters. Local officials confirmed that emergency services received an increase in calls but had not identified any significant impact. The event serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the earthquake-prone region.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has brushed off a heated sideline exchange with tight end Travis Kelce during their win against the New York Giants. Cameras captured the two yelling at each other, with Reid appearing to bump Kelce's shoulder, after the offense failed to score following a turnover. Reid told reporters not to "make too much of it," attributing the incident to Kelce's passionate and emotional nature, which he said he loves. This is not the first on-field dispute between the two, who had a similar, more intense interaction during Super Bowl LVIII, which both later downplayed as part of their competitive relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a strong case for significantly lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. He argued that current policy is far too restrictive and risks unnecessary job losses. Miran contends that policy changes from the White House regarding taxes, immigration, and deregulation have created a new economic landscape that allows for a rate cut of nearly two percentage points. This view places him in direct opposition to the more cautious consensus among his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the sole dissenter in last week's vote.

          <p>With the price of gold surging to a new record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Gold's value has risen over 40% this year, driven by low-interest-rate environments and geopolitical uncertainty. For those looking to invest, most financial experts recommend gaining exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more liquid, cost-effective, and tax-efficient than purchasing and storing physical gold bars or coins. Advisors generally suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement, Berrien dismissed the story as a "garbage political hit" and an attempt by the media to distract from his plans to improve the state's economy, without refuting the specific details of the report about his online activity.</p>

This figure is more than triple the number sold at the previous World Cup.

He successfully ordered three large bladed weapons, one of which was found under his bed along with a bow and arrows. The inquiry is examining the perpetrator's history and any missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy, which occurred when he attacked a children's dance workshop with a kitchen knife. Details from the investigation showed he was preoccupied with bypassing age verification checks for online weapon sales, and was able to receive at least one package despite being underage.</p>

The elk was tranquilized near a motorway and has been fitted with a GPS tag before being released on the Czech-Austrian border. Authorities hope he will join a small, established elk population in the nearby Sumava forest. Emil's journey covered nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, with his movements eagerly tracked by thousands of followers in online groups. Elk were hunted to extinction in the region centuries ago and have only recently been reintroduced in small numbers.</p>

Tech company Oracle will serve as the security provider, continuously monitoring the system to ensure it is not used for malicious purposes or subject to undue influence. A senior White House official stated that the compromise is designed to meet the legal requirements of both the United States and China, and will save the app for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Google is set to begin its second major antitrust trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, with this case focusing on the company's alleged illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market.

The Justice Department is advocating for a breakup of Google's ad-tech business, which the company argues would cause massive disruption to the internet ecosystem. This legal battle follows a recent, less severe ruling in a separate case concerning Google's search monopoly, the outcome of which may influence this trial's proceedings.</p>
