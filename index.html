          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, is set to be sentenced after being convicted of federal civil rights violations related to the 2020 raid that resulted in Breonna Taylor's death. A jury found him guilty of using excessive force by firing shots into her apartment through a covered door and window, endangering Taylor and her neighbors. The Justice Department's recommendation of a single day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from civil rights advocates and Taylor's family, who argue it undermines the verdict and fails to deliver meaningful accountability for the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that Donald Trump's new tax bill is projected to increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The legislation makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, including a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate, while also implementing cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs. Despite these spending cuts, the CBO estimates the bill will result in a net $4.1 trillion addition to the deficit with interest, and leave 10 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034.

          <p>Country singer Luke Bryan amused his concert audience by referencing a recent viral moment from a Coldplay show. He jokingly asked the crowd if anyone was attending with their secretary, a direct nod to the controversy involving Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, who was caught on a "Kiss Cam" with his company's HR chief. The incident, which led to Byron's resignation, has become a popular topic for commentary, with other artists like Morgan Wallen also making light of the situation during their performances.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, a company that rents out data centers for artificial intelligence applications, saw its stock price increase after announcing a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The company stated the capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, will be used for general corporate purposes, including paying down existing debt. This move follows a series of successful financing efforts and a major data center project announcement that have contributed to the company's stock price more than tripling since its public debut on the Nasdaq in March.

          <h2>Resurfaced Remarks Show Charlie Munger Believed Only Married Couples Truly Need to Buy Homes</h2>

          <p>In remarks from a 1998 Berkshire Hathaway meeting, the late investor Charlie Munger bluntly stated his old-fashioned view on homeownership, suggesting it was primarily a need for married couples. When asked for advice on buying a home, Munger quipped, "The single people, I don't care if they ever get a house," adding that the right time for a married person to buy is "when your wife wants one." His perspective, contrasting with Warren Buffett's capital allocation viewpoint, framed home buying as a decision of utility rather than a necessary financial milestone for everyone.</p>

          <p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), under Trump appointee Tulsi Gabbard, has released a report claiming the Obama administration "manufactured and politicized intelligence" regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The report is the latest in a series of efforts by the Trump administration to discredit the intelligence community's long-standing conclusions. Democratic lawmakers have dismissed the release as a politically motivated attempt to amplify conspiracy theories, noting that the declassified documents do not appear to contradict the central finding that Russia engaged in influence campaigns.</p>

          <p>A visually impaired Beyoncé fan reported being treated in a "dehumanizing" manner at a recent concert at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after staff required her to surrender her long cane to enter the VIP standing area. The fan, Esther Obigbesan, who had paid nearly £500 for her ticket, said staff deemed her a health and safety risk. Despite giving up her cane, she was later moved from her spot to a seated area far from the stage. A stadium spokesperson apologized, refunded the ticket, and stated the experience "fell far short" of their standards.</p>

          <p>In a growing trend, popular television series are proactively warning their audiences to refrain from online harassment and hate speech directed at cast, crew, or fellow fans. Prime Video's "The Summer I Turned Pretty" and "Love Island USA" have both recently posted zero-tolerance policies against cyberbullying on their social media channels. This direct approach marks a shift from the industry's typically reactive stance on toxic fandom. The article reflects on how this highlights the pervasive nature of online toxicity and the failure of social media platforms to adequately regulate such behavior.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced the recall of approximately 5 million above-ground pools linked to the drowning deaths of nine young children over two decades. The recall affects pools 48 inches or taller sold by major retailers like Walmart and Target, which were manufactured by Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup. The agency determined that an exterior compression strap could be used by children as a foothold to climb into the pools, even when the ladder is removed. The recall aims to apply an updated safety standard to all such pools sold since 2002.</p>

          <p>Community bail funds, which use donations to pay bail for those who cannot afford it, are facing increasing legislative backlash, primarily from Republican lawmakers. These organizations gained prominence during the 2020 protests but are now targeted by new laws in several states that add restrictions and regulations, often citing public safety concerns. Proponents argue the funds are a crucial lifeline that allows people to return to their families and jobs while awaiting trial. They contend the backlash is a political attack on a model that demonstrates the viability of alternatives to the cash bail system.</p>

          <p>In a formal letter titled "The Voyager Declaration," nearly 300 current and former NASA employees, including astronauts, have sharply criticized the Trump administration's sweeping budget cuts. They warn that the indiscriminate reductions to grants, staffing, and missions threaten safety, innovation, and U.S. national security. The letter, addressed to the new acting administrator, argues that the changes undermine safety protocols established after the Columbia disaster and have caused "catastrophic impacts" on the agency's workforce. The signatories are urging a reversal of the cuts.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, exemplified by new detention centers like "Alligator Alcatraz," are driven by a punitive agenda and misleading rhetoric. It refutes the claim that undocumented immigrants are a primary source of violent crime, citing studies showing they have significantly lower incarceration rates than U.S.-born citizens. The author notes that the administration is cutting funding for federal agencies that fight cartels and terrorism while tripling ICE's budget. The piece traces the racist origins of U.S. immigration crime laws to argue that the current crackdown is a continuation of a discriminatory history.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly insisted that the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians should revert to their previous, controversial names, claiming it would be respectful to Native Americans. However, his power to enforce such a change is likely limited. While Trump has implied he could block the Commanders' potential move to a new stadium in Washington, D.C., the land for the proposed site was transferred from federal to city control under the previous administration. Legal and political obstacles make it improbable that the president could compel the privately-owned NFL franchise to abandon its current name.</p>
