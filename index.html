            <p>Birmingham, the U.K.'s second-largest city, is grappling with a severe sanitation crisis as a garbage strike enters its fifth week, resulting in massive piles of uncollected waste throughout the city. The strike, initiated by Unite union members representing garbage truck workers, stems from disputes over job eliminations and pay cuts amidst the Labour-run Birmingham City Council's financial struggles following a settlement over historic pay discrimination, leading to significant budget cuts. Residents have reported overflowing bins, foul odors, and increased vermin populations, with some resorting to drastic measures like burning garbage bags. The U.K. government faces criticism from opposition parties, while negotiations between the city council and the union continue to resolve the escalating situation.</p>

Lovaglio maintains that the market situation confirms the need for size and revenue diversification, adding that a combined entity would be stronger.

            <p>A sharp decline in U.S. stocks, fueled by President Trump's sweeping tariffs, is raising concerns among investors about a prolonged global trade war and its impact on corporate profits. Wall Street strategists are considering worst-case scenarios, with some predicting a potential 50% drop in the S&P 500 from its February high, which would be similar to the dot-com bubble burst. The recent sell-off's speed and intensity are comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic's onset and the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan equity strategists have outlined a year-end S&P 500 target of around 4,000 in their 'bear case,' factoring in no tariff relief and stagnant profit growth.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean argues that the central bank should aggressively cut interest rates by at least 0.5% to 4% in May to combat the financial turmoil caused by Trump's trade tariffs. He believes the uncertainty created by the tariffs will delay business investments and reduce consumer spending, requiring a stronger response than financial markets currently anticipate. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, suggests an emergency meeting to consider a deep rate cut to bolster confidence and prevent a recession. The OBR previously forecasted that a similar trade dispute could reduce the UK's national income by 1%, prolonging economic stagnation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's imposition of steep new tariffs on imports from numerous countries may inadvertently pave the way for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Trump's actions, styled as America's 'Liberation Day,' have triggered market declines and recession fears, prompting countries to seek alliances against the U.S. threat. This could bolster China's application to join the CPTPP, a 12-member trading bloc including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the U.K., which China applied to join in 2021.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have reached an agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information to locate illegal immigrants subject to deportation. The agreement, formalized in a memorandum of understanding, establishes a process for ICE requests to the IRS to further investigate criminal illegal immigrants who have failed to leave the U.S. 90 days after a final removal order. The Treasury Department emphasizes that the MOU protects the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers while enabling law enforcement to pursue criminal violations, aligning with President Trump's increased deportation efforts. Some IRS officials have expressed concerns that the policy may hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants.</p>

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, expressing concerns about the government's conduct and its threat to the rule of law.

This comes after Trump's 'Liberation Day' announcement of tariffs affecting most countries and U.S. imports. China's commerce ministry strongly condemned the U.S. action as 'blackmail' and stated it would take resolute countermeasures. While global equity markets have been negatively impacted, Asian stocks saw some gains after heavy losses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced extreme volatility following President Trump's tariff rollout, with Wall Street fluctuating in and out of the red. Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China unless the country rescinds its retaliatory tariffs. Top officials in the administration have dismissed fears of a recession and reiterated the tariff policy will be implemented as planned. The EU has said it offered the US a 'zero-for-zero' tariff deal weeks ago, but Trump appeared to quash any such discussions.</p>

The court's decision specifies that challenges must be raised in Texas, where the migrants are confined, and not in Washington DC.

            <p>The article discusses the shifting dynamics between Europe and China, particularly in light of President Trump's global trade war. While Sino-European relations have faced turmoil in recent years, engagement has increased as the U.S. adopts protectionist trade policies. The author suggests that increased European engagement with China could offer a contingency plan for an increasingly adversarial transatlantic relationship. Tariffs are viewed as a sales tax on local consumers and can spark inflation, going against the idea of comparative advantage in trade. Hong Kong is presented as a gateway between the world and mainland China, facilitating understanding and engagement.</p>
