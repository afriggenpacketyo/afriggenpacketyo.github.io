        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luigi Mangione's defense attorneys allege that prosecutors are intentionally biasing the public against him by releasing his journal entries, violating his right to a fair trial. The prosecution included the writings to justify murder charges with a terrorism enhancement, related to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The defense argues that releasing the journal serves no legitimate objective other than to undermine Mangione's right to a fair trial, especially considering potential illegal search issues. Mangione faces both state and federal charges, with the federal prosecution potentially leading to the death penalty, complicating the defense's strategy. The next court date is set for September, with a federal court appearance in December to determine the trial date.</p>

          <p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth revealed that OpenAI countered Meta's lucrative job offers, including signing bonuses potentially reaching $100 million, to retain its AI talent. This revelation highlights the intense competition for AI expertise, as Meta invests heavily in superintelligence and related technologies. Meta's recent moves include investing over $14 billion in Scale AI for a 49% stake, hiring Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman from Safe Superintelligence, and approaching Perplexity AI for a possible acquisition. Bosworth emphasizes Meta's belief in AI's potential to assist humans, justifying the significant investments in personnel and compute power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical piece humorously critiques the lack of clear uniforms for ICE agents and the message it sends about accountability. The author suggests that the absence of a uniform allows agents to operate without clear identification or responsibility, contrasting this with the expectation of accountability when a uniform is present. The piece sarcastically suggests various outfits for ICE agents, emphasizing the importance of not appearing as an official representative of the law. Drawing a parallel to Coco Chanel's collaboration with the Nazis, the article underscores the need for ICE agents to avoid conveying any sense of accountability to the people of the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has given Iran a two-week deadline to 'come to their senses' amid stalled diplomatic efforts, dismissing European talks and reiterating the need for direct negotiations with the U.S. Despite Trump's claims, Iran has rebuffed U.S. offers to resume nuclear negotiations, demanding that Israel cease attacks before engaging in serious talks. Sharp differences exist between Israeli and American assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities, with Trump contradicting his own intelligence community's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Analysts warn that giving Iran extra time could allow them to advance their nuclear program, while the U.S. State Department is providing assistance to thousands seeking guidance on the security situation in the region.</p>

          <p>Rithy Panh's historical drama, 'Meeting With Pol Pot,' fictionalizes the true story of Western journalists invited by the Khmer Rouge to witness their proclaimed utopia. The film stars Irène Jacob as a French reporter, Lise, who is modeled after Elizabeth Becker, and explores the journalists' growing horror as they uncover the regime's cruel reality. Panh uses sound, pacing, and images to establish a mood of tense hospitality, with the journalists' experience resembling a prison drama. The film serves as a reminder of the value and dangers of journalism when confronting and exposing facades, reflecting Panh's soulful sensibility regarding the tragedy that drives his aesthetic temperament.</p>

          <p>José González Valencia, the brother-in-law of fugitive Jalisco New Generation cartel boss 'El Mencho,' was sentenced to 30 years in U.S. federal prison for international cocaine trafficking. González Valencia, known as 'Chepa,' led the 'Los Cuinis' group that financed the drug trafficking operations of CJNG, which was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The Trump administration has sought to increase pressure on CJNG, with the Justice Department prioritizing the dismantling of the cartel. El Mencho's son-in-law, Cristian Fernando Gutiérrez Ochoa, pleaded guilty in a separate case to a money laundering conspiracy charge.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell by about 2% after President Trump decided to postpone assisting Israel in destroying Iran's nuclear program, expressing hope for negotiations. Trump stated he would make a decision on striking Iran within two weeks, allowing space for potential negotiations regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Despite Trump's decision, Israel is escalating its attacks on Iran after eight days of conflict, with Prime Minister Netanyahu ordering intensified strikes on strategic and government targets. Global benchmark Brent crude fell to $77.01 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil settled at $73.84 per barrel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An insurance firm has been ordered to pay nearly $44 million in a lawsuit filed by Ryan Ferguson, who was exonerated after being wrongly convicted of murder. Ferguson had previously won $11 million against police officers, but the insurance company, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., resisted paying most of it. The company argued that its coverage didn't apply because the actions leading to Ferguson's arrest occurred before its coverage began. A jury concluded that St. Paul acted in bad faith and engaged in a 'vexatious refusal' to pay, resulting in the substantial punitive damages.</p>

          <p>Tristan Tate, the brother of Andrew Tate, is under investigation by Romanian authorities for allegedly violating election laws by posting political content on social media during the country's recent presidential elections. The probe was opened after police received an official complaint, alleging that Tate may have tried to influence voters. Tate claims he is 'not campaigning' and is not subject to Romania's 'no campaigning' law. Both Tate brothers are also facing separate charges in Romania and the UK, which they deny.</p>
