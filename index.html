          <p>Gap Inc. shares experienced a significant drop after the retailer announced that new tariffs could negatively impact its business by $100 million to $150 million. This projection accounts for mitigation efforts such as diversifying the supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which is expected to represent less than 3% of sourcing by year-end. Despite tariff concerns, Gap's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, with sales rising 2% to $3.46 billion and earnings per share at 51 cents versus an expected 45 cents. The company anticipates full-year sales growth of 1% to 2%, while navigating potential impacts from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>

He expressed disappointment with a recent budget bill passed by House Republicans. The interview occurred shortly before SpaceX's Starship experienced a setback during its ninth test flight and before Musk's departure from DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).</p>

Comparable sales also increased by 8%, and e-commerce sales rose nearly 16%. As tariffs raise economic concerns, Costco may benefit from its competitive prices and bulk discounts, potentially driving more customers to renew memberships. CEO Ron Vachris stated that customers rely on Costco more in challenging economic times, but tariffs could also lead to higher prices for shoppers (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal court initially froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump, deeming them illegal and exceeding the president's legal authority. The ruling halted the 10% tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner and tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that Congress did not grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs. However, an appeals court temporarily halted this ruling, reinstating the tariffs pending further review.

          <p>Gaza is experiencing a breakdown of security and widespread looting as desperate people search for food amid difficult aid access. A Hamas-run interior ministry reported that seven of its police officers were killed in an Israeli airstrike while attempting to restore order. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) stated that at least two people were shot dead as people broke into its warehouse in search of food. Increased lawlessness has been reported since Israel began targeting Gaza's interior ministry police officers, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Stocks closed higher on Thursday after a panel of federal judges initially blocked President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 117 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 increased 0.4%. The ruling centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. However, an appeals court moved to temporarily reinstate the tariffs, leaving the ultimate fate of the policy uncertain (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized federal judges who blocked President Donald Trump from imposing global tariffs, calling it "judicial overreach" and urging the Supreme Court to intervene. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the judges are threatening to undermine the credibility of the United States on the world stage. She defended Trump's rationale for imposing the tariffs as legally sound and grounded in common sense. The Court of International Trade had previously struck down Trump's global tariffs as "contrary to law."</p>

          <p>Federal authorities busted an Armenian fraud ring in Los Angeles, accusing them of stealing $30 million in COVID relief and Small Business loans. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carried out early-morning raids, arresting fourteen suspects. Investigators say the suspects used phony documents to create multiple shell companies that applied for federal funds. Authorities seized cash, money-counting machines, cell phones, laptops, and firearms. Some of the money was spent on houses and luxury goods, while other amounts were sent to Armenia.</p>

The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33 and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attributed the decline to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss.

This measure has drawn criticism, but it is permitted under the German constitution. The article explores the historical context and rationale behind this constitutional provision.</p>
