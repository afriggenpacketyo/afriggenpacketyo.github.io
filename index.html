          <p>In a recent interview, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, stated that the agency will arrest any person found to be in the country illegally, regardless of their criminal history. While prioritizing serious criminal offenders, this policy marks a reversal of previous rules and includes "collateral" arrests of non-criminals encountered during operations. Lyons also affirmed a crackdown on companies that hire unauthorized workers, framing it as a move against labor exploitation and not just a focus on the workers themselves. The agency aims to meet the administration's goal of one million deportations per year with newly allocated funding.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Describes 'Reign of Terror' from Federal Immigration Raids</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating the raids have instilled widespread fear throughout the city's large immigrant and Latino communities. She condemned the tactics of federal agents, describing masked men in unmarked cars creating a "ghost town" atmosphere and detaining people, including legal residents. Bass also argued that the deployment of military troops to the city was an unnecessary political stunt that misused taxpayer funds. While critical of the immigration policies, she acknowledged the administration's help during the January wildfires and expressed a willingness to work with the White House on future events.</p>

          <p>Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald argues that the recent civil unrest and riots in Los Angeles are a direct result of lawlessness stemming from the Biden administration's border crisis. She suggests that the large influx of immigrants poses challenges to cultural assimilation and that a temporary halt to immigration would be beneficial for the country to properly integrate new arrivals. Mac Donald also states that all individuals in the country illegally are legitimately eligible for deportation, not just those with criminal records, though she questions if the American public has the "stomach" for such large-scale enforcement. The article also notes LA Mayor Karen Bass's strong opposition to the federal sweeps.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident occurred at Dillon Falls on the Deschutes River in Oregon, where one person was killed and two others remain missing after being swept over a waterfall. The group consisted of six people, three of whom were successfully rescued and transported to a hospital for medical attention. Emergency responders utilized drones in their search for the missing individuals near the popular recreational area. The search was paused overnight and is scheduled to resume, as officials have not yet released the names of the victims pending family notification.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls predict his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election took place amid public frustration over rising prices and the potential for U.S. trade tariffs. This projected defeat would undermine the coalition's influence, as it follows a loss of majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts suggest the result could lead to political instability and a potential leadership challenge within the Liberal Democratic Party at a critical time for US-Japan trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebellion have signed a peace declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations. The agreement, which took effect immediately, calls for the restoration of state authority in rebel-held areas and sets a timeline for a comprehensive peace accord by early August. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to immediate disagreements over rebel withdrawal and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. The main challenge, as with past agreements, will be the political will for sustained implementation and the establishment of a functional monitoring mechanism.</p>

The pledge marks the first time the government has set a specific target on spill numbers amid public anger over the state of the nation's waterways and executive bonuses at polluting firms.

His planned trip also includes Scotland, where he previously criticized the government over abortion rights, making claims a spokesperson called inaccurate.

          <p>Despite a strong economy, many companies are conducting layoffs using vague terms like "restructuring" or "optimization," which experts believe often masks job replacement due to artificial intelligence. While firms like IBM and Klarna have been transparent about AI-driven workforce reductions, most are hesitant to explicitly state this, fearing backlash from employees and the public. Experts note that roles in customer service, HR, and content creation are particularly vulnerable. The trend suggests a strategic silence as companies reshape their workforce, even as they sometimes overestimate AI's current capabilities and quietly rehire or outsource to fill the gaps.</p>

He encourages people to connect over shared interests rather than focusing on differences, allowing for relationships to form outside the political sphere.

          <h2>Child Development Expert Argues 'Self-Connection' is the Single Most Important Skill for Parents to Teach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the most crucial skill for a child's lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are vital for mental health and well-being.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The meeting could occur on the sidelines of the summit, or potentially during a visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows a recent face-to-face meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was seen as a key step in stabilizing relations. After a period of tension marked by tariff threats, both nations have recently worked to de-escalate, including agreeing to a preliminary trade deal.</p>

          <p>Amid conflicting data on the U.S. jobs market, this analysis argues that traditional metrics like unemployment and job creation are becoming obsolete. The rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work creating time for side hustles means that "jobs" are no longer a clear indicator of economic health. The article suggests a more relevant measure would be tracking the number of people earning above a certain income threshold from all sources, adjusted for inflation. This shift would provide a more accurate picture of the labor market's health in an economy being reshaped by AI and new work structures (not investment advice).</p>

Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by Interstate 40 in the 1970s, a fate shared by many similar communities. Local residents and business owners are now banding together to prepare for an anticipated flood of visitors, planning history tours, events, and new accommodations. They hope the centennial will breathe new life into their community, which they describe as a slice of Americana "frozen in time," while preserving its unique rural character.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy has died following a school coach crash in Somerset, with four other individuals—two children and two adults—still receiving hospital care. The coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School returning from a zoo trip, veered off the road and slid down a 20-foot slope, prompting the declaration of a major incident. The school was closed as the community left tributes and flowers at the gates, and the head teacher described the event as "horrific." Local residents have raised over £40,000 to support those affected by the tragedy, and a service of reflection is planned at a local church.</p>

Singh, who gained international fame for completing marathons after the age of 89, had retired from racing and moved back to India. His death has drawn condolences from around the world but has also highlighted India's severe road safety crisis, which claims over 150,000 lives annually. Experts point to failures in road engineering and a lack of pedestrian infrastructure as key factors, arguing that authorities often blame victims instead of addressing systemic issues.</p>

Campaigners feel that opportunities to secure the release of their loved ones have been missed, pointing to the deaths of hostages who were alive during previous negotiation periods. Many now place more hope in the U.S. administration to force a deal, believing that far-right elements in Netanyahu's coalition prioritize land and political goals over human life.

Conversely, she is most impressed by applicants who can openly discuss their past mistakes and what they learned from them.

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases, an action that flouts a 2021 law mandating their renaming. To circumvent the law, Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move has been rebuked by members of Congress, including some Republicans, who passed a measure to block the action. The article details the problematic legacies of the original namesakes, such as the incompetent Braxton Bragg and the white supremacist Henry Benning.</p>

          <p>This long-form essay posits that to understand America, one must understand Oklahoma, a state whose history is a stark reflection of the nation's foundational contradictions. The author recounts learning a sanitized version of the state's history, which was built on the violent dispossession of Indigenous nations and racial terror, now rebranded as a pioneering spirit. The piece explores the state's cycle of reinvention, from all-Black towns seeking refuge to modern programs attracting remote workers, arguing it often papers over deeper issues. Oklahoma's history of collision between ambition and betrayal, the essay concludes, makes it a crucial map for navigating America's current political battles.</p>

Americans overwhelmingly want the administration to focus more on lowering prices, and disapproval of Trump's handling of inflation has reached a new high.
