          <p>The Unite union has voted to suspend Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her handling of the prolonged Birmingham bin strikes. Rayner had encouraged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council, escalating a rift between the union and the government. The union's emergency motion also threatens to re-evaluate its relationship with the Labour Party if any union members face redundancy. This public dispute highlights broader tensions over workers' rights, welfare cuts, and job security, potentially impacting Labour's significant financial and political support from one of its largest union backers.</p>

          <p>Reigning champion Tadej Pogačar has won stage seven of the Tour de France, reclaiming the yellow jersey from Mathieu van der Poel. The victory came on the iconic Mur-de-Bretagne climb, where Pogačar sprinted ahead of Jonas Vingegaard to secure the win. British rider Oscar Onley achieved a notable third-place finish, moving him up to seventh in the overall standings. The stage saw 2018 winner Geraint Thomas in a breakaway for much of the day before being caught by the peloton in the hilly final section of the race.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Eligibility for Credit Card Debt Forgiveness for Social Security Recipients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:33:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether individuals living on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, a process of negotiating a reduced lump-sum payment with creditors. While Social Security income does not disqualify someone, the ability to save for a settlement, which averages 50-70% of the original debt, can be a significant hurdle for those on a fixed income. A key advantage for recipients is that federal law protects Social Security benefits from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide leverage in negotiations. The article suggests weighing this option against alternatives like credit counseling or debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has led to the temporary closure of the Grand Canyon's North Rim and mandatory evacuation orders for the area. The fire, which started near Jacob Lake, has burned approximately 1,000 acres and remains uncontained as of Friday. Officials reported that the fire was sparked by a thunderstorm, and crews, supported by air tankers, have been working to suppress it. Key transportation routes, including Highway 89A to Fredonia, have been closed, and hikers are being advised to avoid the canyon due to extreme heat and smoke.</p>

          <p>This article assesses the advantages and disadvantages of using high-yield savings accounts in July 2025, noting that while rates are still high, they may soon decline. Currently offering rates around 4.30%, these accounts provide a significant return compared to traditional savings, but potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could lead banks to preemptively lower these variable rates. A key benefit is the flexibility and access to funds, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty. However, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer traditional branch banking. (not investment advice)</p>

The law also eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students, sets new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS loans, and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants.

The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.

          <p>This article analyzes the interest-earning potential of depositing $10,000 into either a long-term or short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current market. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, long-term CDs ultimately generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a top-rated one-year CD might yield around $440, whereas a five-year CD could earn nearly $2,300 on the same principal. The choice depends on the saver's financial goals and their need for liquidity, as long-term CDs require locking up funds for a longer duration. (not investment advice)</p>

Under UEFA rules, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same competition, and Lyon takes precedence due to their higher domestic league finish.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while the Trump Justice Department's conclusion that Jeffrey Epstein's death was a suicide and that no "client list" exists has caused public outrage, it is unlikely to be a major political issue. The author suggests that the obsession with the case is a distraction from more substantive topics like the economy, immigration, and crime, which will truly determine elections. The writer acknowledges the administration's conflicting statements on the matter but urges the public to focus on real-world issues and personal well-being rather than getting consumed by what is framed as a tawdry sideshow.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis has ranked the most affordable states in the U.S. for 2025, with West Virginia claiming the top spot as the least expensive place to live. The rankings consider a cost of living index, housing affordability, and home insurance costs, which are becoming a major factor nationwide. Other states praised for their affordability include Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, and Alabama. The report highlights how some states have managed to keep costs for housing and everyday goods relatively low, making them attractive for both residents and businesses looking to mitigate the effects of inflation.

However, economists warn that the full impact of existing and potential tariffs has yet to be felt and could lead to a mild stagflationary shock.

          <p>Virginia has dropped to fourth place in CNBC's annual "Top States for Business" rankings, down from its number one spot last year, largely due to the economic impact of federal job cuts. The Trump administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce have disproportionately affected Virginia, where a significant percentage of the population is employed by the government or federal contractors. This has led to a slowdown in job growth and concerns about the state's economic resilience. Governor Glenn Youngkin insists the state can absorb the losses, pointing to hundreds of thousands of open private-sector jobs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating trade tensions with a key ally. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the flow of fentanyl as reasons for the new levy. He warned that the rate could increase if Canada retaliates further, stating that any new Canadian tariff would be added to the 35% charge. This move adds to existing U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, creating further uncertainty for North American trade.</p>

          <p>Data from the CDC shows that emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. are at their highest level in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute this rise to record-high tick populations and a longer tick season, both driven by climate change causing milder winters and wetter springs. This trend increases the public health risk from tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Powassan virus. Health officials are urging people to take preventive measures, including wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the national conversation about boosting U.S. birth rates, including debates over IVF, largely overlooks the significant role of male infertility. Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases among heterosexual couples, men are often not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The piece suggests that a politically viable path to improving fertility rates could involve expanding access to and coverage for male-specific infertility treatments. This approach could offer an alternative to the contentious IVF debate and more equitably distribute the burden of fertility care.</p>
