            <p>Design software company Figma has confidentially filed for an IPO with the SEC, a move that comes after the company's $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe was called off due to regulatory concerns. The IPO filing occurs 16 months after the Adobe deal termination, where Adobe paid Figma a $1 billion termination fee. Figma's software is popular among designers who collaborate on website and app prototypes, and the company was valued at $12.5 billion in a 2024 tender offer. The IPO market has been relatively quiet since late 2021, making Figma's move a notable event. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A study revealed that zoo animals, particularly primates, exhibited changes in behavior when zoos closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bonobos and gorillas spent less time alone when visitors returned, while chimpanzees ate more and engaged more with their enclosures. Olive baboons engaged in less sexual and dominance behavior with visitors present. The researchers suggest that returning visitors stimulated the chimpanzees and baboons, while the gorillas may have been disrupted by the crowds. The findings provide valuable data for understanding how visitors affect animal welfare in zoos and parks.</p>

            <p>The Trump White House has reduced press pool access for all wire services, including the Associated Press, following a court order to restore AP's access to Oval Office events. The move expands the pool to include more print journalists, networks, and new media outlets, while limiting the guaranteed access previously granted to wire services. The decision follows AP's victory in a lawsuit over its exclusion from the press pool, which the court ruled was unfair. The Trump administration has been persistent in including new media and dismantling the traditional press pool system.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are questioning the constitutionality of President Trump's suggestion to send US citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons. While Trump stated he was "studying the laws," experts argue that such a move would violate several constitutional provisions, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Concerns have been raised following the deportation of migrants alleged to be MS-13 gang members to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. The discussion has intensified amid the legal battle surrounding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing his health department to work with Congress on revamping a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, potentially benefiting pharmaceutical companies. The order seeks to delay the timeline for small molecule drugs to become eligible for price negotiations, aligning it with the longer wait for biotech drugs. While the order aims to reduce healthcare costs, critics argue that it could stifle innovation and benefit drugmakers. The executive order also addresses other aspects of healthcare costs, including aligning Medicare payments with hospital costs.</p>
