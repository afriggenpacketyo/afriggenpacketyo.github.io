          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not finalize a trade deal with the U.S. unless all new tariffs are reconsidered, highlighting a disagreement over which tariffs are negotiable. Japan is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties on the auto industry, which accounted for a significant portion of exports to the U.S. last year. Akazawa's remarks emphasize the divide between the two countries regarding tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. Despite ongoing negotiations, both sides have yet to reach common ground on the issue of tariffs.</p>

          <h2>New Tariffs on Imported Auto Parts Expected to Raise Vehicle Costs in the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has implemented 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. This move, initiated by President Trump to boost domestic manufacturing, follows earlier tariffs on imported cars and impacts even vehicles assembled in the U.S., as they often rely on foreign-made components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico and a temporary reprieve for U.S. car manufacturers, analysts predict car prices will still rise, possibly leading to parts shortages as suppliers face financial strain. General Motors estimates the tariffs will cost them up to $5 billion this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is designed to reduce the use of 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk often used with older adults, which can convey assumptions of frailty and incompetence. Studies have shown that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care among residents with dementia. The CHAT program, involving videos and discussions, has proven effective in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, and is now being adapted for online use. The article emphasizes the importance of respectful communication and addressing older adults as adults.</p>

However, President Trump criticized Harvard's handling of the situation and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. Litvak also emphasized the importance of addressing the financial challenges facing Medicare and Medicaid, advocating for waste reduction in healthcare spending. A lawsuit over frozen research grants adds further tension between Harvard and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia's center-left Labor Party has won a second term as Prime Minister, overcoming earlier poll deficits due to cost-of-living concerns. Voters opted for the known quantity of Albanese amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. The conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, faced a significant defeat, even with dissatisfaction regarding the status quo, partly due to campaign missteps and association with Trump's policies. The election outcome reflects a disaffection with major parties, especially among younger voters, who seek bolder solutions for national challenges.</p>

          <p>A Member of Parliament is advocating for a reevaluation of the ban on alcohol consumption in football stands, citing the need for a "modern approach." Current legislation prohibits fans from drinking alcohol in view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football. The MP suggests that trials should be conducted to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions, drawing comparisons to other sports and European football leagues. The Football Supporters Association supports the call for trials and a discussion on the issue.</p>
