          <p>Tim Leiweke, CEO of sports and entertainment venue company Oak View Group, faces a federal indictment for allegedly rigging the bidding process for a major University of Texas arena project. The indictment accuses Leiweke of conspiring with a competitor to have them drop their bid in exchange for lucrative sub-contracts, a promise he later reportedly broke. Two related companies, Oak View Group and Legends Hospitality, are expected to reach non-prosecution agreements and pay substantial penalties totaling over $16 million. The case highlights aggressive antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice in corporate dealings.</p>

His performance significantly altered the general classification, positioning him second overall.

          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and significant legislative changes looming, borrowers are facing a new financial landscape. A new law is set to phase out popular income-driven repayment (IDR) plans and tighten borrowing limits, potentially making repayment more challenging. This article outlines several strategies for borrowers to make their payments more affordable now, including switching to an existing IDR plan before they are eliminated and exploring employer assistance programs. Acting proactively can provide crucial financial breathing room before the stricter rules take full effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book on the 2024 election provides insight into Vice President Kamala Harris's decision to choose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate over other finalists like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. According to the book, Harris felt a better personal rapport with Walz, who came across as more deferential and less ambitious than Shapiro during their final interviews. The choice was aimed at appealing to white voters in key "Blue Wall" states, despite Walz's self-professed nervousness about debating and lack of teleprompter experience. The decision was later criticized by some pundits following the election loss.</p>

          <p>Following the recent war with Israel, questions surrounding the succession of Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have intensified. The process of choosing a successor is opaque but critical for the future of the Islamic Republic, with potential candidates ranging from Khamenei's own son to past reformist presidents. Analysts suggest that after significant setbacks, Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may favor a change, potentially even to a non-clerical leader, to alter the country's course. The ultimate choice will depend on whether Khamenei dies naturally, which could favor a moderate, or is assassinated, which would likely empower a hardliner.</p>

          <h2>Report Details Use of Civilian Contractors to Drive Bulldozers for Demolitions in Gaza</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights a new and controversial aspect of the conflict in Gaza: the Israeli military is reportedly outsourcing the demolition of buildings by hiring civilian bulldozer drivers. Advertisements on social media have offered significant daily wages for this work, which involves the systematic destruction of entire neighborhoods. Scholars on genocide and international law quoted in the article characterize this large-scale demolition as unprecedented and a flagrant violation of legal principles. The practice is seen as part of a broader strategy to render large parts of the Gaza Strip uninhabitable, raising serious questions about corporate and state complicity in potential war crimes.</p>

          <p>The deadly Texas flash floods were caused by a confluence of weather factors, including moisture from a tropical system, over a region naturally prone to such events. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching many residents and campers by surprise in the early morning hours. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of their emergency warnings, with many survivors stating they received no alerts. Some officials have defended their actions, citing the unprecedented nature of the deluge, while others point to a lack of a robust, modern warning system in the rural area.</p>

          <p>In a podcast conversation with The Atlantic's David Frum, lawyer George Conway discusses the profound threats to the rule of law under the Trump administration. Conway, a lifelong conservative who has become a prominent Trump critic, argues that the president's character makes him incapable of fulfilling the fiduciary duties of his office. He and Frum explore how the legal system is struggling to contain a president who disregards norms and laws, and why Congress has failed in its constitutional oversight role. Conway warns that the courts alone cannot save democracy from a lawless executive, emphasizing the critical role of political and moral accountability.</p>
