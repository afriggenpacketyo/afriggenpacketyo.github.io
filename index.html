          <p>Amid the devastating flash floods in central Texas that have claimed 68 lives, a U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer is being hailed as a hero for his life-saving actions. Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, 26, is credited with rescuing 165 people, many of them children from the inundated Camp Mystic. This was reportedly the first rescue mission of his career, and he served as the sole triage coordinator at the scene, earning praise from officials for his selfless courage. His efforts represent a significant positive story of bravery and resilience during the ongoing tragedy.</p>

          <p>After making landfall in South Carolina, Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression but continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and into Virginia. The system brought heavy rainfall, with some areas expecting up to six inches, leading to numerous road closures and the collapse of a highway section in Chatham County, North Carolina. While no injuries were immediately reported, emergency crews were conducting rescues of stranded motorists. Forecasters also warned of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast for the next several days as the system moves northeast.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Extend Bereavement Leave for Miscarriages at Any Stage of Pregnancy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning a significant change to its Employment Rights Bill that will grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to paid bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks, so the amendment aims to formally recognize the grief associated with loss at any stage. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time away from work to grieve without having to rely on sick leave. Advocacy groups have praised the move as a major step forward in acknowledging the emotional impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The difference in taste between American and European chocolate stems from distinct production priorities and regulations. U.S. chocolate, like Hershey's, often includes butyric acid, a preservative that extends shelf life but imparts a slightly sour tang that can be unfamiliar to European palates. American recipes also tend to have a higher sugar content. In contrast, EU regulations mandate higher cocoa solid percentages and the use of cocoa butter as the main fat, while traditional processes like conching create a finer texture. These varying approaches reflect different consumer preferences and historical developments in the global chocolate industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has successfully deported eight men to war-torn South Sudan, a country with a "do not travel" advisory, following a prolonged and contentious legal battle. The men, originally from several different countries, were held for weeks at a U.S. military base in Djibouti after a federal judge initially halted their removal. After the case reached the Supreme Court, which cleared the way for the transfer, the men were flown to South Sudan. The Department of Homeland Security stated the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S. and framed the deportation as a "win for the rule of law."</p>

Military analysts suggest that using these mines could help Ukraine fortify its defensive lines against Russian assault squads, a tactic Moscow has increasingly employed. Russia is not a signatory to the treaty and has been widely accused of using such mines in the conflict.

This access to critical engine technology is vital for Comac to fulfill hundreds of existing orders and pursue its ambitions of expanding into European markets.

This demographic shift is driven by factors including increased economic independence for women and changing social norms, but it poses long-term challenges such as shrinking workforces and straining social safety nets like Social Security.

          <p>Jason Chapman, a world-renowned British ecologist and expert on insect migration, has taken a full-time position at Nanjing Agricultural University in China, highlighting the country's growing prominence in natural sciences. Chapman stated that China is now a world leader in radar entomology, possessing cutting-edge technology for tracking flying insects that was a major draw for his move. His decision to leave the University of Exeter for the role in Nanjing underscores a broader trend of China attracting top international scientific talent. This is due to its significant investment in research infrastructure and its growing influence in various scientific fields.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Links European Housing Crisis to Financial Sector's Growing Influence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis argues that the severe housing crisis across Europe, from Dublin to Berlin, is being fueled by the increasing financialization of the housing market. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have treated housing as a lucrative "asset class," buying up vast numbers of properties and driving up prices and rents to maximize profits. This shift has been enabled by government policies that privatized public housing and liberalized mortgage credit, empowering investors at the expense of residents. The result is a growing inequality and political disillusionment, as homeownership becomes unattainable for the working and middle classes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States men's national team lost to Mexico 2-1 in the Gold Cup final, ending a promising tournament run on a disappointing note. The defeat raises questions about the team's progress under coach Mauricio Pochettino less than a year before the World Cup is set to be held on home soil. Despite missing several key players, the U.S. had shown signs of progress, but the loss in the final highlighted ongoing inconsistencies. Pochettino noted the heavily pro-Mexico crowd in Houston as a factor, but the result will likely fuel debate about the team's readiness for the 2026 tournament.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that killed at least 80 people, attributing the lack of advance warning to the storm's unexpected intensity and speed. In Kerr County, where the majority of deaths occurred, the Guadalupe River surged to near-historic levels in under an hour during the night while residents were asleep. The county judge noted the absence of a river warning system and stated there was no reason to believe the rainfall would lead to such a catastrophic event. This lack of preparedness is a key focus as the community grapples with the immense scale of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has publicly criticized his former ally, Elon Musk, following the tech billionaire's announcement of a new political party called the "America Party." Trump dismissed the idea as "ridiculous," stating that a third party would only add to political confusion within the established two-party system. The spat marks a significant falling out between the two, who had previously collaborated on a government efficiency initiative. Musk's move to create a new party was prompted by his public disagreement with the president's recent tax and spending legislation, which he argued would increase the national debt.</p>

The bloc, which recently expanded to include several new members, issued a joint statement expressing serious concerns about unilateral measures that distort global trade. The summit took place as U.S. President Trump threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on countries that align with BRICS, escalating geopolitical and economic tensions. The meeting highlighted the bloc's goal of challenging the Western-dominated global order and increasing the influence of the Global South. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in all participants of a small clinical trial. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. Researchers reported significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants, with children responding particularly well; one seven-year-old regained almost full hearing within months. This cutting-edge treatment, which was found to be safe, offers hope for treating other forms of genetic deafness in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has caused confusion in global markets regarding the implementation of new trade tariffs, with officials giving conflicting information about the effective date. While President Trump suggested deals or tariff letters would be finalized by July 9, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that the new rates would not take effect until August 1. The president also announced an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with the "Anti-American policies of BRICS," adding another layer of uncertainty for importers and trade partners. This lack of clarity has contributed to market jitters as nations await formal notification of their new tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>
