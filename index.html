          <p>Israelis gathered across the country to mark two years since the devastating Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, which resulted in over 1,200 fatalities and 251 hostages. This solemn commemoration coincides with ongoing indirect negotiations in Egypt, aiming to finalize a US-backed peace plan to end the war in Gaza. The conflict has tragically claimed over 67,000 lives in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with Israeli military operations continuing intensely in areas like Gaza City. UN Secretary General António Guterres has urged all parties to embrace the proposed peace plan, highlighting it as a crucial opportunity to bring the protracted and tragic conflict to a resolution and foster stability in the region. Families of victims and hostages expressed deep pain and a longing for the return of captives, underscoring the immense human toll of the ongoing violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor, Dwayne Dixon, revealed at a Harvard panel that an Antifa-linked group, the Anarchist People of Color Collective (APOC), had requested his gun club, Redneck Revolt, to provide security during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Dixon, who was temporarily suspended and then reinstated by UNC due to reports of his activism, was a member of Redneck Revolt, which has since disbanded. The video of the Harvard panel, initially published in 2018, was abruptly removed last week. This article highlights the perceived organized nature of some far-left groups, despite their claims of operating without serious organization, amid broader discussions on political activism and potential violence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to significantly raise trash collection fees for many residents, doubling costs for some, to address a nearly $1-billion budget deficit. The city's trash program had been heavily subsidized for 17 years, accumulating a $500,000 daily deficit, exacerbated by a 2016 state law on organic waste disposal and rising operational costs. The new fees, expected by mid-November, will impact single-family homes and smaller apartments, aiming to cover actual service costs. This measure comes as residents already grapple with soaring living expenses, with some council members dissenting due to concerns over affordability and perceived misaligned city priorities.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois, reportedly at an Army Reserve facility near Chicago, despite strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Governor Pritzker accused the Trump administration of an "authoritarian march" and a "power grab," filing a lawsuit to block the deployment, which he deems illegal and unconstitutional. Texas Governor Greg Abbott confirmed authorizing the deployment to protect federal officials. Chicago officials assert there is no crime emergency to justify military presence, citing significant reductions in homicides and shooting incidents. The situation highlights a growing federal-state clash over domestic military deployment and law enforcement roles.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about resolving U.S.-China trade disputes, emphasizing America's need to win the AI race to ensure the future is built on an American tech stack. Huang advocates for American companies to access the best chip technology, desiring a global reliance on U.S. tech, similar to the dollar's role. His remarks follow an agreement for Nvidia and AMD to share 15% of China sales revenue with the U.S. government for export licenses. Huang warned that a complete ban on chip exports to China would harm American companies long-term, though Nvidia's guidance excludes China sales, suggesting potential upside from any resolution.

Soto was inspired after an article he was writing about writers leaving L.A. due to lack of opportunities was decommissioned due to a layoff. Renowned authors like Roxane Gay support the center, emphasizing the need for community and resources for writers. The center’s recent launch showcased diverse literary talents, fostering excitement for a new era in L.A.'s literary arts.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to review the feasibility of random polygraph examinations for employees and contractors, and to intensify scrutiny on leaks to the press. The directive emphasizes incorporating leak-related questions into standard security clearance processes. While ODNI states this reinforces existing policies, sources suggest it aims to curb disclosures of classified and sensitive information, potentially chilling the flow of information to the public. Gabbard has made criminal referrals for leaks, arguing they damage national security and credibility. Critics, however, warn the mandate could be an "obnoxious flexing of bureaucratic muscle" and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Conor McGregor has accepted an 18-month ban for violating the organization's anti-doping policy, specifically for missing three attempted biological sample collections in 2024. The ban, reduced from 24 months due to his cooperation and injury circumstances, began on September 20, 2024, and will conclude in March 2026. McGregor, who last competed in July 2021, was ordered to pay £206,000 in damages in November 2024 to Nikita Hand, who accused him of sexual assault in 2018. UFC President Dana White recently denied McGregor's claims of signing to fight on a 2026 White House card, adding to the fighter's ongoing controversies.</p>

          <p>Major drugmakers are increasingly adopting direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales models, a strategy encouraged by the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Amgen, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis, and Bristol Myers Squibb have all launched or expanded DTC programs, offering significant discounts on various medications like cholesterol-lowering drugs, weight loss treatments, and blood thinners. This approach bypasses traditional middlemen, aiming to reduce costs for patients and capture more revenue. The Trump administration's "most favored nation" policy and the upcoming TrumpRx.gov website are driving these changes, signaling a significant shift in pharmaceutical sales and pricing strategies.

Experts note that markets are forward-looking and tend to price in future conditions rather than current political "noise."

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for car finance mis-selling, potentially leading to payouts from 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The scandal stems from undisclosed discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) where dealers received commissions based on interest rates, incentivizing higher charges. The FCA banned DCAs in 2021, recognizing they led to consumers overpaying. While an earlier Supreme Court ruling narrowed the scope, the FCA expects average payouts of £700 per mis-sold agreement, totaling around £8.2 billion. Lenders are expected to cover costs, with many already setting aside billions for potential redress.</p>

          <p>Deciding between traditional pretax and after-tax Roth 401(k) contributions for retirement savings can be complex, often misjudged by focusing solely on marginal tax rates. Certified financial planner Cody Garrett emphasizes that understanding one's *effective* tax rate—taxes paid as a percentage of total income—is crucial, as it may be significantly lower in retirement than anticipated. Pretax deferrals offer upfront tax breaks, while Roth contributions grow tax-free. This article advocates for a multiyear perspective on tax decisions, suggesting pretax options might be more beneficial if a lower effective tax rate is expected in retirement, potentially enabling future planning opportunities like Roth IRA conversions.
