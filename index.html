          <p>A Singapore-based scientist, formerly a quantum researcher in Russia, has raised concerns about the security of China's quantum satellite, Micius. The scientist, Alexander Miller, suggests that tiny delays between the satellite's onboard lasers could be exploited by eavesdroppers to hack the system. Miller's analysis of communication data between a ground station and Micius revealed time delays in the quantum transmitter, indicating a potential vulnerability in the distribution of quantum keys, which are essential for secure quantum communication. This vulnerability could compromise the security of China's expanding quantum communication network.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, indicating a willingness to release hostages but demanding key changes to the plan. The group insists on a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guaranteed humanitarian aid, conditions not fully addressed in the current proposal. Steve Witkoff, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, has deemed the response "totally unacceptable," urging Hamas to accept the original framework for further talks. Despite the pressure from the international community and the dire conditions in Gaza, Hamas is caught between the need to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians and its commitment to securing a lasting end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog indicates that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February, raising concerns about potential proliferation implications. The IAEA has called on Tehran to urgently cooperate with its investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites, suspecting a secret military nuclear program until 2003. This development could lead to heightened tensions between Iran and the West, potentially triggering snap-back sanctions.</p>

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, faces scrutiny as satellite data and field reports question its effectiveness. While the program aimed to replant millions of native trees, analysis suggests that deforestation has occurred on NGP lands, with native trees being cleared to grow cash crops. The investigation highlights concerns about greenwashing and the sustainability of the program. Communities involved often lack long-term access to the land and are pressured to grow single cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods.</p>
