          <p>Dr. Tsion Firew shares her personal and professional journey during Rwanda's 2024 Marburg virus outbreak, a deadly relative of Ebola. Faced with immense personal sacrifice, including sending her young children to another country, she navigated the fear and exhaustion of treating colleagues and friends. The article highlights Rwanda's effective public health response, which achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak, contrasting it with the politicization of health crises elsewhere. Her story underscores the power of a science-led approach and the profound human cost borne by healthcare workers on the front lines of epidemics.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old skydiving instructor, Justin Fuller, died during a tandem jump near Nashville after becoming separated from the rig and falling without a parachute. His student survived, becoming lodged in a tree with an open parachute before being rescued by fire crews. Fuller was an experienced skydiver with over 5,000 jumps who had also trained military personnel. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, though initial reports suggest the equipment was not faulty. The jump was organized by Go Skydive Nashville, which states its instructors are highly trained professionals.</p>

This landmark deal positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI's ambitious infrastructure projects, reducing its reliance on Nvidia and highlighting the increasingly interconnected economy of the AI industry.

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine has been awarded to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their foundational discoveries regarding peripheral immune tolerance. Their collective work identified regulatory T-cells (T-regs) and the Foxp3 gene that controls their development, revealing a critical mechanism the body uses to prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues. This breakthrough has opened a new field of immunology, paving the way for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The trio will share the prize money of nearly $1.2 million.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's ambitious Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program is facing significant challenges as sea tests for its prototype vessel, the Hai Kun, have fallen behind schedule. The submarine, a key component of Taiwan's strategy to enhance its asymmetric naval defense capabilities, has spent an unexpectedly long time in dry dock for maintenance between surface navigation tests. These delays are raising new questions about the project's future and whether it can meet its operational targets. The program is seen as a critical effort by the island to bolster its defenses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chuck Collins' new book, "Burned by Billionaires," argues that the U.S. economic system is designed to perpetuate wealth inequality, making it opaque to most Americans while the ultra-wealthy thrive. The article outlines Collins' analysis of how billionaires not only accumulate wealth but also employ a "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants to protect it, while using political influence to further rig the system in their favor. This "hyper-extraction," often through private equity, impacts everyday costs like healthcare and rent. The piece suggests this growing inequality fuels political discontent, which can be exploited by populist rhetoric.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning to repeal the Clinton-era "roadless rule," a policy that has protected 58 million acres of America's national forests from new roads and development for over two decades. The move is part of a broader push to increase timber harvesting from federal lands, which the administration frames as a way to generate revenue and reduce reliance on lumber imports. Environmental advocates and former officials argue that rescinding the rule threatens critical ecosystems, clean drinking water sources for millions of Americans, and vital carbon stores. Critics also question the economic sense of building expensive new roads into remote areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling granting former presidents broad immunity for official acts could have significant negative consequences for international justice and the global legal order. The article contrasts this decision with the evolving international legal precedent, exemplified by the 1999 Pinochet case, which moved away from absolute immunity for former heads of state accused of international crimes like torture. The author argues that the U.S. court's decision weakens America's moral authority to hold other leaders accountable and could encourage other nations to adopt similar far-reaching immunity protections. This shift represents a departure from the principles established at the Nuremberg tribunals.</p>

          <p>The animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has unexpectedly become Netflix's most popular film of all time, driven by its hit soundtrack and a story that authentically embraces its cultural roots. The film, which follows a K-pop girl group who are secretly demon hunters, was initially passed over for distribution by its production studio, Sony, before landing on Netflix. Analysts attribute its success to its immersive approach, which assumes the audience's familiarity with K-pop culture rather than explaining it from an outsider's perspective. The movie's success has defied industry expectations, leading to a massive cultural footprint and merchandise demand.</p>

Team management noted that Kershaw embraced the decision, prioritizing the team's chances of winning over a starting role.

          <p>Alverno College's decision to sell its on-campus Early Learning Center to the United Community Center has created uncertainty and distress for parents, particularly students who rely on its services. The college cited a shift from student to community usage as the reason for the sale. However, the transition will bring changes like a new age cap and a schedule no longer aligned with the academic calendar, forcing some student-parents to find alternative care mid-year. Despite guarantees that federal childcare grants will remain accessible, affected parents have expressed frustration over the unclear timeline and lack of communication from the college.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Lowered Hiring Standards for ICE Amid Rapid Expansion Pose Public Safety Risks</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) recent decision to lower its hiring standards is reckless and poses a danger to the public. To meet an ambitious hiring goal of 10,000 new agents, the agency has reduced the minimum age to 18, eliminated an age cap, and shortened training time, including firearms and language lessons. The author contends that these lowered requirements, which are less strict than many local police departments, risk placing inexperienced and poorly trained agents in volatile situations. This could lead to rights violations and repeats the mistakes of a previous rapid Border Patrol expansion that resulted in corruption and misconduct.</p>

          <p>Welsh singer Charlotte Church, who rose to fame as a child, has reflected on the "insane" press intrusion she experienced as a teenager, calling her treatment by the media a "travesty." She recalled how newspapers constantly tried to create a "fallen angel" narrative, misconstruing events and publishing stories that felt like a "knife to the skin." Church, who successfully sued the publisher of the News of the World for phone hacking, believes her defiance and anger at the time helped protect her from internalizing the shame the media attempted to impose on her.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece questions why the Supreme Court's conservative majority has repeatedly ruled in favor of the Trump administration, drawing parallels to judiciaries in authoritarian states. The author explores several theories for this deference, including ideological alignment, a fear of direct confrontation with a president who might ignore their rulings, and a fundamental miscalculation about the strength of U.S. democratic institutions. The article argues that by consistently siding with the administration, particularly on its emergency docket, the justices are engaging in a form of appeasement that cedes dangerous levels of power to the executive branch and fails to provide necessary constitutional checks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court begins a new term under intense scrutiny, with its conservative majority expected to rule on a series of ideologically charged cases that could reshape American democracy. Following recent transformative rulings on abortion and presidential immunity, the court will now hear cases concerning the Voting Rights Act, mail-in ballots, and presidential tariff powers. Legal experts express concern that the court's recent tendency to side with the Trump administration on its "shadow docket" signals a shift toward expanding executive power. The outcomes of these cases could have profound consequences for the separation of powers and the future of U.S. elections.</p>

          <p>The use of the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, often called the "psychopath test," in capital cases is under increasing criticism from researchers and lawyers who argue it can unfairly prejudice juries. The article focuses on the case of Robert Roberson, a Texas man facing execution who was labeled a psychopath during his trial's sentencing phase based on the test. Critics argue the checklist can be subjective, weaponized by prosecutors, and gives a false impression of scientific neutrality, leading to harsher sentences. Even the test's creator, Robert Hare, has stated he would be "appalled" if a life-or-death decision were based primarily on the checklist.</p>

          <p>Following their 2024 election loss, the Democratic Party is embroiled in an internal debate over its future direction, with a growing clash between moderates and progressives. Moderates argue that progressive activists have pushed the party to adopt unpopular positions that alienate mainstream voters. In contrast, progressives contend that the party's problem is timidity, not ideology, and that they should double down on a bold, unapologetic platform. This article analyzes the progressive argument, which dismisses unfavorable polling and advocates for re-educating the electorate rather than compromising to meet voters where they are, a strategy that could determine the party's viability.</p>

          <p>Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki discusses the complex nature of empathy, explaining it as a three-part skill involving emotional sharing, cognitive understanding, and compassionate concern. The article explores the potential downsides of empathy, such as burnout and biased decision-making, as well as its profound benefits for personal well-being, social connection, and health outcomes. Zaki argues that empathy is not a fixed trait but a muscle that can be strengthened through conscious practice, such as developing humility and turning empathic feelings into positive action. He refutes the idea that empathy requires condoning others' actions, framing it instead as a tool for connection and understanding.</p>

          <p>California is grappling with a severe nursing shortage, a paradox given that tens of thousands of qualified applicants are turned away from nursing schools each year. The primary obstacles are a lack of faculty to teach courses and a scarcity of required hands-on clinical training slots in healthcare facilities. This mismatch has led to intense competition among students and tensions between public and private nursing programs vying for limited resources. State initiatives are attempting to expand public programs, but the crisis highlights systemic challenges in producing enough healthcare professionals to meet the state's growing demand.</p>

Under the plan, young individuals would receive a £5,000 tax rebate toward their first home upon securing their first full-time job, funded by diverting their National Insurance payments into a savings account. The party stated this policy would be paid for by significant cuts to public spending, including reductions in welfare, the civil service workforce, and the foreign aid budget.
