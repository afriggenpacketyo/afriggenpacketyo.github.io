          <p>Israel's President Isaac Herzog expressed his country's openness to international support in eradicating Iran's nuclear program. Herzog stated that Israel shared intelligence with the U.S. prior to attacking Iran, indicating the country's plans to produce nuclear weapons. While not explicitly requesting U.S. intervention, Herzog implied that active participation would be welcomed. He also suggested that the war could weaken Iran's regime and potentially lead to the end of the conflict in Gaza, though analysts warn of potential escalation and market instability.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the NHS, with NICE concluding they offer too little benefit for the cost. These drugs slow the disease but do not reverse or stop it, potentially delaying the transition from mild to moderate dementia by a few months. The official price in the US is £20,000-£25,000 per patient per year, and NICE determined that funding them could lead to cuts in other essential services. Pharmaceutical companies plan to appeal the decision, while some experts support NICE's assessment of the drugs' limited real-world benefits.</p>
