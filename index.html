            <p>As major tech companies like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia prepare for first-quarter earnings, they grapple with uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. These tariffs disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and potentially slow down consumer spending, impacting ad revenue and overall profitability. Companies face challenges in planning for the future, deciding where to manufacture, and managing inventory amidst fluctuating trade conditions. Tesla's reliance on imported parts, Alphabet's cloud infrastructure spending, and Apple's manufacturing in Asia highlight the broad exposure to these trade headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Simone Biles's former coach, Aimee Boorman, revealed that the gymnast suffered from the "twisties" prior to the 2016 Olympics, years before the condition affected her performance at the Tokyo Games. This condition causes gymnasts to lose spatial awareness during aerial maneuvers, posing a significant risk of injury. Boorman's account highlights the challenges Biles faced even during her peak performance years, and how they managed to overcome them. Biles has not publicly commented on Boorman's claims.</p>

            <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped significantly, and other major indexes also fell sharply. The market's reaction suggests investor unease with the ongoing tension between the White House and the Federal Reserve, and the potential economic impact of Trump's tariffs. The president is pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but the Fed is hesitant to do so until the impact of the tariffs is more clear. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The friendship industry, comprising ventures aimed at alleviating loneliness, often focuses on meeting new people rather than fostering deeper connections with existing friends. Research suggests that loneliness stems from a lack of intimacy and vulnerability in relationships, rather than a shortage of friends. Building frientimacy requires consistency, positivity, and vulnerability, aspects that are often overlooked in the superficial interactions promoted by the friendship industry. Structural issues, such as affordability and access to mental healthcare, also contribute to loneliness and are not addressed by these ventures.</p>
