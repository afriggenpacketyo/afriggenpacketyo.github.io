        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for the restaurant chain Cracker Barrel fell by approximately 10% after the company revealed a new, more modern logo as part of a broader brand revitalization effort. The new design, which removes the iconic image of a man leaning on a barrel, has drawn significant criticism on social media, particularly from conservative commentators who argue it moves away from the brand's traditional American identity. This backlash is part of a larger trend where corporate branding changes have led to notable stock market fluctuations based on political and social reactions.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary fine, which had exceeded $500 million, imposed on Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled the penalty was unconstitutional, citing the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by overstating asset values to secure better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions imposed by the original judge will also remain in place.</p>

He assured fans he is receiving medical care and is expected to recover fully, but not in time for the show's intensive training schedule. Actor Lewis Cope will replace Nairn in the competition.</p>

While the influential "Magnificent Seven" stocks are mostly weaker, the health-care sector has shown resilience. Pharmaceutical stocks, in particular, have performed well following news that a new U.S.-EU trade agreement framework would set tariffs on imported drugs at a more manageable 15% rate. Investors are now awaiting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium for further market direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chicago-area man, Sergio Ramirez, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since late May after he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, allegedly made a wrong turn at the U.S.-Canada border. Ramirez, who has lived in the U.S. for two decades and has a U visa application pending for seven years, is being held in a Michigan jail. His family and civil rights advocates are calling for his release, arguing his detention is unjust given his legal status is under deferred action.

          <h2>Erik Menendez Appears Before Parole Board Seeking Release After Nearly Three Decades</h2>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted along with his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, appeared for a parole hearing after serving nearly 30 years in prison. His eligibility stems from a sentence reduction under California's youth offender law, as he was under 26 at the time of the crime. The defense argues the brothers acted in self-defense after years of abuse and have been rehabilitated, while the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office strongly opposes their release. The final decision on any parole grant would rest with Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Around 600 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have received termination notices as part of a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

A recent court ruling protected some CDC divisions but cleared the way for these terminations, which affect various departments, including the Division of Violence Prevention.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals a growing trend where nearly 44% of American adults are ordering meals from children's menus at restaurants. The primary motivations cited are saving money amid economic uncertainty and a preference for smaller portion sizes. This consumer behavior coincides with major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's reporting slower sales, particularly among lower-income customers. The research suggests that the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus are becoming an increasingly attractive choice for budget-conscious adult diners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a decline. This uptick is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also increased by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price increases. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% annual gain, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point with improving affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a taxable account for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, effectively postponing the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. While this tax-deferral technique can be highly beneficial, it comes with strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, typically starting at $1 million. Financial advisors caution that investors must also be comfortable holding the resulting ETF for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds worldwide. On average, artificial light at night causes birds to begin their vocalizations about 20 minutes earlier and end them 30 minutes later, effectively extending their day by nearly 50 minutes. The research, which covered over 500 species, found that birds with larger eyes, such as American Robins, were most affected. The long-term consequences of this disruption on bird health, sleep, and breeding cycles are not yet fully understood.</p>

The discussions reportedly focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. Tensions have been high since the fall of the Assad regime, with Israel conducting numerous strikes in Syria. While full normalization of ties is seen as a long-term goal, the talks represent a potential pathway to greater stability in the region.</p>

          <p>A resident of South Lake Tahoe, California, has tested positive for the plague and is currently recovering at home. Health officials believe the individual was likely bitten by an infected flea during a recent camping trip in the area. Plague is naturally present in rodent populations in many parts of California, and while human cases are very rare, they can be serious if not treated promptly with antibiotics. Officials are reminding the public to take precautions when outdoors, such as avoiding contact with wild rodents and their burrows.</p>

Storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to go out and patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., on Thursday night, alongside police and members of the National Guard. The announcement follows the recent deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to the city as part of a new anti-crime initiative. The administration claims the surge has led to hundreds of arrests and a reduction in crime, though local police data shows violent crime has been declining for over a year. The move is unusual for a sitting president.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom received a record 111,000 asylum applications in the year ending in June, a 14% increase from the previous year and surpassing the previous peak in 2002. Despite the record number of new applications, new Home Office figures show that the government is processing cases at a faster rate, leading to a reduction in the overall backlog of undecided cases. The number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has risen slightly, and the Labour government continues to face pressure over its handling of immigration and its pledge to clear the backlog by 2029.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that Stephen Miller's intense focus on mass deportations, while cruel, may be counterproductive to the Trump administration's broader authoritarian aims. The author suggests that the highly visible and aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, such as the militarization of Washington, D.C., generate significant public resistance while failing to consolidate political power effectively. Unlike more subtle, systemic changes, these actions serve as a galvanizing force for the opposition. The article posits that Miller's personal obsession with immigration may be undermining the administration's strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer WH Smith dropped by 42%, wiping nearly £600 million off its market value, after the company announced a £30 million accounting error in its North American division. The mistake, which involved recognizing income from supplier arrangements too early, forced the company to slash its group profit forecast from an expected £140 million to £110 million. The board has launched an independent review to be conducted by Deloitte.

          <p>A record number of students in the UK, nearly a quarter of all candidates, are resitting their Maths and English GCSE exams, prompting educationalists to warn of a "resit crisis." In England, students who fail to achieve a passing grade at age 16 must continue to retake the exams, but pass rates for these resits are very low. Experts suggest the curriculum may be too demanding and that many students are falling behind on fundamental skills much earlier in their education. The situation places a significant strain on students and the colleges that must facilitate the repeated exams.</p>

At the same time, many of these firms made opportunistic buys, increasing their stakes in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and beleaguered stocks like UnitedHealth Group, demonstrating a long-term investment horizon despite short-term market volatility.

The primary drawbacks include high upfront fees and compounding interest that can rapidly deplete a home's equity over time. Homeowners also face the risk of foreclosure if they fail to pay property taxes and insurance or no longer use the home as their primary residence. Furthermore, the growing loan balance reduces the inheritance left for heirs, potentially leaving them with substantial debt to settle upon the homeowner's death. (not investment advice)</p>
