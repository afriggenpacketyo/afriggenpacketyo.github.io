            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey, resulting in the deaths of all six people on board, including a family of five from Spain and the pilot. The helicopter, operated by New York Helicopters, took off from Lower Manhattan and flew past landmarks before crashing, with witnesses reporting seeing parts of the helicopter separating in mid-air. Emergency responders recovered the bodies, and investigations are underway by the FAA and NTSB to determine the cause of the crash, which involved a Bell 206 helicopter owned by Meridian Helicopters. The incident prompted a safety zone in the Hudson River, impacting ferry services and raising concerns about helicopter safety in the area.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Despite recent weakening of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar, economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its currency to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about triggering financial market instability and capital outflows. Analysts expect the People's Bank of China to manage a gradual and orderly depreciation of the yuan instead of a rapid devaluation, which could weaken consumer confidence and risk capital flight, as seen in 2015. Capital flight is Beijing's top concern, and the government will try to assure the market that it has the ability to defend the yuan against U.S. sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With the U.S. raising tariffs on Chinese imports, Chinese exporters are raising prices for American consumers and accelerating plans to diversify operations, with some halting shipments entirely. U.S. consumers could lose access to certain products, and prices for continuing shipments are expected to rise, and some American companies are looking for alternatives. China's Ministry of Commerce is encouraging domestic sales, but Chinese consumers are reluctant to spend, while Goldman Sachs cut its China GDP forecast to 4% due to U.S. trade tensions and slower global growth, with an estimated 10 to 20 million workers in China involved with U.S.-bound export businesses.

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting American products in protest of President Trump's stance on Greenland and trade tariffs, with grocery stores like Føtex labeling European-owned brands to help consumers make informed choices. The boycott reflects broader anti-American sentiment in Europe, with hashtags like #BoycottUSA gaining traction on social media, and some U.S. brands like Tesla facing backlash and declining sales. Travel data also suggests a decline in trips to the U.S. amid Trump's policies and unfavorable currency fluctuations, though some analysts believe consumer protests may be short-lived as shoppers prioritize value.</p>

While the White House boasts about world leaders reaching out to make deals, the president's on-again, off-again tariff moves create instability for businesses, and the trade war with China carries enormous risk and may alienate allies. While Trump aims to generate revenue through tariffs, the long-term impact on prices for U.S. consumers remains to be seen, with some analysts suggesting Americans may switch to more domestic production.</p>

Instead, Europe should present itself as a stable alternative to the U.S.'s chaos and unpredictability, leveraging its rule of law and the potential of the euro as a reserve currency.

            <p>The US Supreme Court instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. The court declined to block a lower court's order, but directed the lower court to explain the extent to which it required the Trump administration to 'effectuate' Mr Garcia's return. The government has said Mr Garcia was deported due to an 'administrative error', although they also allege he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies.</p>

            <p>Doctors and nurses are calling out common health 'lies' you should stop believing, including that getting cold or wet will give you a cold, that sugar causes kids to be hyper, and that health insurance companies always follow the best medical practice. They also emphasize that doctors and nurses do not perform lab tests, that antibiotics will not cure a cold, and that ER wait times are often due to overcrowding and abuse of ER services, and the hospital will never give you a blood transfusion based on a blood type found on a medical alert bracelet.</p>

Some of her bets have paid off after markets soared on Trump's decision to pause most tariffs, but the move has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest for lawmakers owning shares of companies they can influence. The MAGA supporter has been outspoken in her support of Mr. Trump's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Then, a single warning, posted in Arabic on X by a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), triggered panic and chaos in the densely populated area known as Dahieh. The area was soon cleared, and Israeli forces destroyed the marked building, which they said was a warehouse storing Hezbollah drones.</p>
