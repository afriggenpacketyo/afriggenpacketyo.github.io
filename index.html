          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto advisor, anticipates the stablecoin legislation, GENIUS Act, will pass with bipartisan support in the Senate. He claims that providing a legal framework for stablecoins could create trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks notes that there is already over $200 billion in stablecoins that are currently unregulated. The bill has cleared a key procedural vote, indicating strong support, although concerns remain about safeguards preventing the president and his family from profiting from the legislation.

          <p>The Trump administration has expedited refugee status for Afrikaners, a White ethnic minority from South Africa, citing violence and discrimination. This decision has sparked debate, with some Afrikaners claiming a 'White genocide' is occurring, a view supported by Elon Musk. However, other Afrikaners, like commentator Piet Croucamp and cattle farmer Nick Serfontein, dismiss these claims as untrue, stating that Whites remain economically strong and that crime affects all races. Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted. They also highlight government efforts to train Black farmers and share land, emphasizing that the real issue is general crime, not racial targeting.</p>

The New York Times reported on these allegations, leading to an emergency meeting where the national board voted to remove Steinley. Steinley denies the accusations, calling the decision retaliatory. The Appraisal Institute had previously paid $412,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against him.

Mao added that the project will heighten the risk of turning space into a war zone and creating a space arms race, shaking the international security and arms control system.

This decision has sparked debate about the impact of federal oversight on policing, with critics claiming consent decrees are too broad and restrictive. Supporters argue that these agreements are the government's most powerful tool to overhaul troubled departments and set a standard for American policing. Despite the administration's move, some community members say the consent decree process helps restore trust in the police.</p>

          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly to Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019, marking a shift in the sneaker giant's distribution strategy. Nike had previously stopped selling wholesale on Amazon due to concerns about counterfeit products and a desire for greater control over the customer experience. The new agreement represents a win for Amazon, which has sought to attract more high-end brands to its platform, expanding its selection for U.S. customers. Amazon will soon begin sourcing a much wider range of Nike products directly.</p>

The deal, announced last October, faced delays due to government changes in both Mauritius and the US. Under the terms, Britain is expected to give up sovereignty of the island territory to Mauritius, and lease back a crucial military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The government is yet to spell out the estimated cost of payments the British taxpayer will make under the deal, but it is expected to run into the billions.</p>

Cramer believes that the market will rebound once the budget bill is passed, shifting focus to the potential for tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. He acknowledges current market stresses, including higher rates and new tariffs, but emphasizes that the U.S. economy is resilient and can navigate these challenges. According to Cramer, the U.S. is so wealthy that it can "kick the can down the road for decades before the national debt blows up in our face."</p>

The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a 'life-threatening' condition as one capable of causing death. While the changes do not expand abortion access, it represents a pivot for Texas Republicans and aims to avoid confusion among doctors, supporters of the bill have said.</p>
