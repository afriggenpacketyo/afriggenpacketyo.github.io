          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina. While the storm has weakened, it continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and into south-central Virginia, with forecasts predicting 2 to 4 inches of rain and localized amounts up to 6 inches. Authorities have issued flood watches and warned of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast. In Chatham County, North Carolina, heavy rainfall has already caused a highway to collapse and flooded over 100 roads, demonstrating the ongoing danger even as the storm's wind speeds decrease.</p>

          <p>Campaigners in the United Kingdom are calling on ministers to maintain the existing system of education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special needs and disabilities. They argue that these legally binding documents are "precious legal protections" and that abolishing them could deny thousands of children access to vital educational support. The government has acknowledged the current system is struggling and is considering reforms, but has not ruled out scrapping EHCPs, leading to criticism from opposition figures. Despite the debate, recent data shows a significant increase in both the number of existing EHCPs and new requests for assessment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on its global trading partners to finalize new trade agreements, warning that higher tariffs could be implemented as soon as August 1. White House officials stated that letters will be sent to numerous countries that have not yet secured a deal, with a particular focus on the 18 nations that account for 95% of the U.S. trade deficit. President Trump also threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with the economic policies of the BRICS alliance. While some deals have been made, the impending deadline creates significant uncertainty for the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior South African police official has publicly accused the country's police minister and other high-ranking officers of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. The provincial commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Lt. Gen. Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, alleged that officials were shielding politically connected individuals and obstructing probes into organized crime. The allegations have been labeled a matter of "grave national security concern" by President Cyril Ramaphosa and have prompted calls from opposition parties for an urgent parliamentary debate and an independent inquiry. The controversy highlights deep-rooted concerns about corruption within the South African Police Service amid a rising tide of targeted killings.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen, stating the action was a response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel. The targeted sites, including the ports of Hudaydah and Ras Isa, were allegedly used to transfer weapons from Iran. Israel's defense minister confirmed the strikes were part of "Operation Black Flag" and that one target was a commercial ship hijacked by the Houthis in 2023. Shortly after the Israeli attack, Houthi-run media reported that its air defenses confronted the strikes, and the Israeli military confirmed two missiles were subsequently launched from Yemen toward Israel.</p>

His instrumental music became a powerful form of expression, conveying a vast range of emotions from joy to melancholy. The author, who has processed her past through writing, notes that while she gave him back his childhood through her memories, he gives her his through his melodies, teaching her the importance of silence and listening.</p>

          <p>The death toll from devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to at least 81, with more than 40 people still unaccounted for. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River rise to the height of a two-story building, was particularly catastrophic in Kerr County, where 68 fatalities occurred, including 28 children. A children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely impacted, with at least 10 campers and one counselor still missing. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the county as search and rescue operations continue around the clock, with officials warning the number of missing may be underrepresented due to unrecorded campers in the area.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett publicly dismissed concerns that new work requirements would lead to widespread loss of health coverage, despite a Congressional Budget Office estimate that up to 11.8 million people could lose their insurance. The new rules require many able-bodied adults to prove they are working or volunteering, a policy critics argue creates significant administrative burdens that will push eligible people off the program.

          <p>Amid a public feud with President Trump, billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," but establishing it as a viable force is a formidable challenge. Election law experts note that creating a new national party requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws, overcoming high signature and voting thresholds for ballot access, and facing intense legal opposition from the established Republican and Democratic parties. While Musk's immense wealth could fund the effort, the process is time-consuming and expensive, likely taking years and hundreds of millions of dollars to achieve national recognition and would not be feasible by the 2026 midterms.</p>

The group funds its activities through cattle-rustling, taxation, and extortion, and has dramatically increased the frequency and scale of its attacks, posing a severe and growing threat that military juntas and international forces have so far been unable to contain.</p>

She reflects that while society has made some progress, it remains deeply fatphobic, and she was not prepared to have her body "dissected again." The new series stars Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe as a couple navigating a new romance in London.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong overall record, the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing signs of trouble, particularly after being swept by the Houston Astros. The team is now just 20-19 against opponents with winning records, a worrying statistic for a club with postseason ambitions. Furthermore, the team is grappling with a significant number of injuries, with key players like Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman facing potential time on the injured list, further straining a roster that already has 12 players sidelined. Manager Dave Roberts remains unconcerned publicly, but the team's struggles against quality opponents and its growing injury list present clear challenges moving forward.</p>

          <p>The looming expiration of a 90-day pause on President Trump's proposed tariffs is forcing global businesses to fundamentally rethink their supply chains to mitigate financial risk. An Illinois toymaker, facing a massive increase in import taxes on its Chinese-made products, is shifting production to Vietnam and India. Similarly, Canadian businesses are contending with retaliatory tariffs, leading a restaurant chain to alter its menu because it can no longer afford to import specialized US-made fryers. This economic uncertainty is causing a significant and costly realignment of global manufacturing and trade routes as companies seek to avoid the impact of the new US trade policies.

          <p>On the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, King Charles has released a message calling for unity against those who seek to create division. He condemned the "senseless acts of evil" on July 7, 2005, when suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's public transport system, and offered prayers for all those affected. The King praised the courage and compassion shown in the aftermath of the attacks and emphasized the importance of building a society where people of all backgrounds can live together with mutual respect. Commemorative events, including a national service at St Paul's Cathedral, will be held to remember the victims.</p>

          <p>The official inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, focusing on the human impact and the status of compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly accused of theft due to a faulty IT system, leading to wrongful prosecutions, financial ruin, and imprisonment for many. Harjinder Butoy, who was jailed for 18 months, stated he needs to see those responsible punished for the devastation caused. While over £1 billion has been paid out, hundreds of victims are still awaiting final payments, with solicitors warning that full and fair redress could still take years.</p>

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK has developed a highly sophisticated counter-terrorism apparatus, but faces a threat that is far more complex and diverse. The 2005 attacks exposed failures in intelligence sharing and prompted a massive overhaul, leading to better-funded, regionally-focused operations and new laws to prosecute terror preparations. However, the rise of ISIS introduced the challenge of self-radicalized, lone-wolf attackers, which in turn inspired similar tactics from the far-right. While the state's powers to disrupt plots have grown significantly, the modern threat landscape, fueled by the internet and encompassing a wider range of ideologies, presents an ever-evolving and difficult challenge.</p>

          <p>A police officer who was one of the first responders to the 7/7 London bombings has recounted the moment she understood the true scale of the attack. Superintendent Anna Bearman, a 23-year-old constable at the time, was initially dispatched to what was believed to be a fire at King's Cross station. She describes a "pinch-in-the-stomach moment" when her team was diverted to Russell Square and saw injured people fleeing, realizing it was a sinister, major incident. Her team entered the smoke-filled tunnels to rescue victims, carrying out one person who had lost a limb, a memory that highlights the horrific reality faced by rescuers on that day.</p>

          <p>Oil prices have declined by over 1% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to increase oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This figure surpassed market expectations and represents a more aggressive hike than the monthly increases seen over the past few months, sparking concerns about potential oversupply. The group cited a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals as the basis for their decision. The move is seen by some analysts as a strategic effort to compete for market share, even at the cost of a temporary decline in prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in central Texas that killed nearly 80 people, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate warnings to the public. Some local officials, including the Kerr County judge, stated the severity of the flood was entirely unexpected, noting the lack of a county-wide warning system due to cost. However, the National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued multiple flood watches and warnings with significant lead time. The tragedy has sparked a debate over the effectiveness of weather alerts, public desensitization to warnings, and whether staffing shortages at the NWS impacted coordination with local emergency managers.</p>
