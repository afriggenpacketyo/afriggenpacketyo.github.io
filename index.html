          <p>A senior science reporter explores the changing ecosystems of California's tide pools, focusing on the impact of marine heatwaves and the decline of sea stars. The absence of sunflower sea stars, a key predator of sea urchins, has led to kelp forest devastation, impacting the entire coastal ecosystem. Scientists are using community science and studying resilient sea star genomes to understand and potentially restore these vital habitats. The article highlights the interconnectedness of coastal ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts. Optimism remains as dedicated scientists and volunteers are working to safeguard the future health of California’s coastal ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration over alleged attempts to control academic decision-making, specifically challenging a freeze on billions in federal funding.

Harvard's president asserts that no government should dictate the curriculum or academic pursuits of private universities. The lawsuit underscores the escalating tensions between the Trump administration and higher education institutions over academic freedom and perceived antisemitism on campuses.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. The proposal involves raising the amount imported from the United States to around 410,000 tons from the current 350,000. This move comes as Trump's trade policies continue to impact international relations and economic agreements. The potential increase highlights the ongoing efforts to balance trade interests and maintain stable economic relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Home batteries are booming as extreme weather increases power outages, offering backup power and energy savings. Companies are creating user-friendly battery systems that store solar energy or charge during off-peak hours. Battery-equipped appliances, like stoves, are also emerging, improving efficiency and resilience. While still expensive, home batteries offer energy independence and grid stability, especially with electric vehicles enabling bidirectional charging. Despite potential setbacks from the Trump administration, the home battery revolution is poised to continue, driven by affordability and the need for reliable power.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Clean energy is growing rapidly, but five threats loom large: tariffs, economic uncertainty, regulations, an aging power grid, and competition from dirty energy. Trump's tariffs raise costs and create uncertainty, while potential economic recession could weaken financing. Regulations and an aging grid hinder deployment, and the fossil fuel industry actively lobbies against climate policies. Despite these challenges, clean tech continues to improve, and states and companies remain committed to clean energy. Individual actions, like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, also drive the transition.</p>

          <p>In Iowa, wind energy is a major power source despite Trump's anti-wind stance, driven by economic benefits rather than climate concerns. The state's farmers profit from turbines on their land, and wind energy provides stable, affordable power. While some Republicans dismiss Trump's views, his policies could harm Iowa's economy. The article highlights the disconnect between anti-climate rhetoric and the reality of renewable energy benefiting Republican strongholds. The future of wind energy in Iowa depends on whether local conservatives can push back against Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, potentially involving space-based interceptors, is being re-evaluated by the Pentagon. This system, far more complex than Israel's Iron Dome, aims to intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) early in flight. Experts discuss the technological challenges, including the need for a large satellite constellation for effective coverage. Concerns are raised about the potential for triggering a new nuclear arms race if rival nations respond by expanding their arsenals.
