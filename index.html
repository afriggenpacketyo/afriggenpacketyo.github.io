          <p>Hamas and the Israeli government have responded to former Biden official Matt Miller's statement that Israel "without a doubt" committed war crimes in Gaza. Hamas stated Miller's comments reveal that he was "not allowed to speak the truth" while in office. The Israeli government insists that it upholds the highest levels of international law and investigates any claims of misconduct. Miller's accusations and the subsequent responses underscore the ongoing debate over the legality and morality of actions in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Freeze Impacts Legal Immigrants</h2>

          <p>Millions of legal immigrants' lives are being upended after the US Social Security Administration quietly instituted a rule change to stop automatically issuing them social security numbers. The Enumeration Beyond Entry program, which began in 2017, was halted without public notice on March 19. This affects millions of immigrants every year and burdens Social Security Administration offices, as applicants must now apply separately. The Trump administration issued a memo aimed at preventing undocumented immigrants from receiving social security benefits, but provided no evidence of it being a problem.</p>
