JPMorgan Chase has initiated coverage of Pop Mart with an overweight rating, projecting substantial revenue growth through 2027.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals a fierce debate among officials in the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and State Department following the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Despite a judge's order prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was deported, prompting a scramble among officials on how to handle the error. Some officials considered portraying Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader without evidence, while others, like Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, advocated for his return to the United States. Reuveni was later fired for not zealously advocating on behalf of the U.S., and Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador despite court orders demanding his release.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction following a case brought by two Chagossian women. The agreement, which would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, faces opposition from some Chagossians who feel excluded from negotiations. The court order prevents the UK from finalizing the transfer of the British Indian Ocean Territory until further notice, and the case will be heard again. The Chagos islanders themselves – some in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others living in Crawley in Sussex – do not speak with one voice on the fate of their homeland.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts are raising concerns that U.S. semiconductor export controls on China are proving to be a failure, causing more harm to American businesses than to China. The restrictions, intended to curb China's military advancement and maintain U.S. dominance in AI, have instead incentivized China to develop its own chip industry. Experts argue that these curbs reduce the ability of U.S. companies to access the Chinese market, while simultaneously accelerating domestic innovation in China. The evolving policies and lack of a clear end game have created issues and collateral damage, leading to questions about the policy's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected borrowing figures for April have put pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with experts predicting potential tax increases in the autumn. Borrowing reached £20.2 billion, £1 billion higher than April of the previous year, marking the fourth highest April figure since 1993. While tax receipts increased due to higher National Insurance contributions, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is estimated at £148.3 billion, still above the government's forecast, leading to concerns about meeting economic rules without future tax hikes.</p>

The rally was also fueled by macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, reinforcing Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge against fiat instability.

          <p>The reconstructed roof of a 14th-century tower in Fengyang County, China, partially collapsed, prompting an investigation into potential substandard or illegal renovations. Videos showed tiles cascading off the Drum Tower, which was renovated last year to fix falling roof tiles. Questions have arisen regarding the quality of the renovation and the misuse of public funds. CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, reported that the building atop the base was built illegally in the 1990s without proper approval from cultural heritage officials, raising concerns about the authenticity and integrity of the structure.</p>

          <p>A review recommends violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence to ease prison overcrowding. The review also suggests managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot program for some sex offenders. The government will expand a small pilot scheme offering voluntary chemical castration to some sex offenders to 20 more prisons after the report said that trial should continue. Critics argue the proposals do not consider the views of victims and could endanger the public, while supporters say community sentences could reduce reoffending.</p>

          <p>China has expressed concerns to the European Union regarding proposed handling fees on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the EU to provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly from overseas, while parcels stored in European warehouses would incur a lower fee. The fee is intended to generate revenue for Brussels to cover customs and safety checks.</p>

President Trump’s administration has given refuge to white Afrikaners, despite the fact that they continue to control half of the land in South Africa. This is an attempt to flip the narrative of apartheid, and cast former oppressors as victims. It’s about spreading the global white replacement conspiracy theory.</p>

          <p>While Russia appears reluctant to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine, increasing economic and military pressures could eventually drive Moscow to the negotiating table. Russian stockpiles of military equipment are expected to run out between now and mid-fall, and further offensive operations into 2026 would likely require forced mobilization. Russia's war-focused economy is also facing challenges, including international sanctions, rampant inflation, and high food and production costs. Tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" and declining oil prices are further compounding these economic pressures, potentially leading to a slowdown in economic growth.</p>
