          <p>Google has agreed to a settlement of nearly $1.4 billion with the state of Texas over allegations of unlawfully tracking and collecting the private data of its residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company secretly tracked movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. A Google spokesperson stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have long been changed, and the company is pleased to put them behind them as they focus on building robust privacy controls into their services. This settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement Texas obtained from Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, marked by increased shelling and the use of drone attacks, escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan accused Indian forces of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting air bases, including a key installation near Islamabad, following India's claim that Pakistan sent waves of drones into Indian airspace. The conflict began after militants killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denies. The use of drones marks a new phase in the conflict, raising concerns about reshaping the dynamics between the two countries, while diplomatic pressure from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has so far been ineffective.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, has been released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled her continued detention unconstitutional. Ozturk had been detained since March, accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war, however, the government did not call any witnesses during the hearing. Judge William Sessions stated that her detention chills the speech of millions of non-citizens in the U.S., adding that the only evidence against her was the op-ed, with no evidence of violence or advocating violence. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, celebrated her release, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller indicated that the Trump administration is actively considering suspending habeas corpus for migrants, which would curtail their right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified this potential action by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional. This consideration follows the administration's previous attempts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportation of noncitizens, which were blocked by federal judges.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are preparing to resume trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in January, triggering retaliatory measures from Beijing. Despite ongoing tensions and rhetoric, both countries are signaling a desire to break the deadlock, though neither wants to appear to be backing down. The tariffs have negatively impacted both economies, with factory output in China taking a hit and the U.S. economy experiencing a contraction. The timing of the talks coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, showcasing China's alternative global leadership and trade options.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, which could result in new tariffs imposed under the Trade Expansion Act. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on various factors, including domestic demand, the role of foreign suppliers, and the influence of foreign governments. While the aerospace industry has maintained a trade surplus, it relies heavily on global suppliers, and tariffs could negatively affect the sector. Companies like RTX and GE Aerospace have already estimated significant costs from existing tariffs.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams' abandoned federal corruption case. Adams stated he discussed New York City priorities, including a wind farm project that was canceled by the Trump administration. Trump claimed Adams came to thank him, without elaborating. The released documents revealed that the FBI investigated Adams for potential witness tampering, though no charges were filed. The Justice Department had previously dismissed the case, citing the need for Adams' cooperation on immigration policy, a move that caused controversy and resignations within the department.</p>

Since taking office, President Trump has proposed a transactional offer to President Zelensky, requiring Ukraine to share its critical minerals with the U.S. in exchange for arms.

Omada offers virtual programs for patients with prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension, generating $169.8 million in revenue during 2024, a 38% increase from the previous year. The IPO market has been largely dormant for tech companies, but Omada hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for virtual chronic care solutions. Omada contracts with over 2,000 employers, supporting 679,000 members as of March 31, and sees significant market opportunity given that over 156 million Americans suffer from at least one chronic condition.</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives passed a Republican-backed bill to restrict property ownership by citizens of China, along with nationals from Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill, known as SB17, aims to protect Texans from foreign influence by hostile nations. Critics, including Democratic representatives and Asian-American groups, have denounced the bill as xenophobic and discriminatory. The bill now returns to the Senate, and if passed by both chambers, would go to Governor Greg Abbott, who has signaled his support.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff detected a spear-phishing attempt, prompting the council to reset passwords for all users across the education service as a precaution. While no data has been compromised, the incident has disrupted students' access to learning resources. The council has assured that students currently sitting exams will be given priority support, and an online help page has been set up to assist with password resets.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a contagious liver infection, with cases surging among groups not typically at risk. The county has seen at least 138 cases in 2024, and levels in local wastewater suggest the numbers are undercounted. While hepatitis A is commonly associated with unhoused individuals, travelers, men who have sex with men, and drug users, many recent cases have occurred outside these groups, raising concerns about food contamination and community circulation. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, and vaccination is the best prevention method.</p>

He arrived at the union office with a thumb drive and a stack of papers, asserting that he has all the required documentation, including over 1,500 receipts, meeting minutes, and explanations for his expenses. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) suspended Escobar and other union officers over financial issues, alleging that about $800,000 in credit card purchases were not properly documented.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns that heat may damage crops in China’s agricultural heartlands. The wheat, of milling quality, is slated for delivery in July and August. This move comes after a risk warning was issued in Henan province, which grows about a third of China's wheat crop, due to hot, dry weather. China has been one of the world's biggest wheat importers, buying around 11 million tons worth $3.5 billion in 2024, but shipments slowed sharply after China reaped large wheat and corn harvests last year.</p>

          <p>A recent trial in Memphis, Tennessee, involving the death of Tyre Nichols, an unarmed Black man beaten by police officers, has exposed the stalled movement towards police reform. Despite video evidence of the brutal assault, the jury acquitted three of the former officers involved in Nichols’s death on several charges, including second-degree murder. This verdict underscores the difficulties in securing murder convictions for officers, even with video evidence. The city of Memphis has also refused to enter into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, further signaling a retreat from reform efforts, particularly with the Trump administration's stance on more brutal policing.</p>

The attorneys general assert that the permitting process will cause irreparable harm to state natural and historic resources.
