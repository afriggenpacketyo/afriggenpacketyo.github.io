          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a historian and euroskeptic, is poised to become Poland's next president, a surprising turn of events given his relative obscurity just months prior. Backed by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, Nawrocki's campaign presented him as an independent candidate, despite his close ties to PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Nawrocki's campaign focused on themes of Polish sovereignty and skepticism towards the EU, while facing allegations about his past, including alleged ties to hooliganism. His victory signals potentially difficult times ahead for the current government of Donald Tusk, especially considering Nawrocki's criticism of aid for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Mohamed Sabry Soliman with a hate crime for allegedly attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, who were supporting Israel and calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas. The criminal complaint suggests Soliman targeted the demonstrators due to their support for Israel. The incident, which involved a fire attack, resulted in eight people being hospitalized with burns and other injuries. President Trump condemned the attack and criticized Biden's border policies, claiming they allowed the assailant's entry into the country. The suspect is also facing state charges related to the attack.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is petitioning the Supreme Court to overturn a district court's injunction that has halted plans to reduce the federal workforce and reorganize federal agencies. The lower court's order has effectively frozen these efforts across 19 agencies and 11 Cabinet departments, which sought to implement President Trump's executive order to lay off tens of thousands of workers. The administration argues that the Constitution grants the president control over agency staffing without requiring special permission from Congress. The case was initiated by federal employee unions, nonprofits, and local governments, who contend that only Congress has the authority to reorganize the federal bureaucracy.</p>

The diamond resurfaced at auction in Geneva in 1996 and has remained out of public view until now. The piece is expected to sell for between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000, while a sapphire and diamond necklace, "The Blue Belle," is expected to lead the sale, estimated at $8,000,000 to $12,000,000.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court's intervention to allow it to proceed with plans to lay off thousands of federal workers across multiple agencies, amidst ongoing legal challenges. This request follows a preliminary injunction preventing the administration from implementing these reductions-in-force. The administration argues that the president has the authority to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch without congressional authorization. Labor unions and other groups have sued to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeds presidential authority and violates the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that removing fluoride from public water supplies could lead to a substantial increase in tooth decay and dental care costs for children in the United States. The study, published in JAMA Health Forum, estimates that eliminating fluoride would result in 25.4 million additional cases of tooth decay and approximately $9.8 billion in costs over five years. The study emphasizes that publicly insured and uninsured children would be disproportionately affected. While fluoride is a common ingredient in toothpaste, drinking water remains a primary source of fluoride for many Americans.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are heading to the polls to elect a new president, an election seen as a referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeol and the governing conservative party. The election comes nearly two months after Yoon was removed from office after his impeachment for declaring martial law. Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. The new president will face a deeply polarized country amid intensified tariff threats from the Trump administration and growing ties between North Korea and Russia.</p>

          <p>A decision coach who helps people make significant life choices in single sessions notes that many clients take too long to make decisions, exacerbating the difficulty. Lengthy decision-making processes add too many details, making it harder to weigh advantages and disadvantages effectively. This prolonged deliberation drains energy and mental space, negatively impacting overall well-being. The coach advises against overanalyzing and spending excessive time on decisions, as it often makes life demonstrably worse.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle Cuccia, former chief Pentagon correspondent for One America News (OAN), claims she was fired after criticizing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's media restrictions. Cuccia accused Hegseth of limiting press access following the "Signalgate" controversy, where sensitive military details were allegedly shared in a group chat. She argued that the restrictions paint a false picture of journalists freely accessing classified information. Cuccia emphasized her conservative background and loyalty to the Maga movement, while expressing concern over the defense department's motives.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to consider a Republican challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be counted if received up to two weeks after Election Day. The justices will hear arguments on whether Rep. Mike Bost and former presidential electors have the legal standing to sue over the law. Lower federal courts had previously ruled they lacked standing. The case has the potential to amplify claims that late-arriving ballots undermine confidence in elections, echoing statements made by President Trump.</p>

Three conservative justices publicly noted their disagreement with the decision, and a fourth expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of such bans. The Maryland law, passed after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, bans dozens of firearms and limits gun magazines to 10 rounds. The challengers argued that people have a constitutional right to own firearms like the AR-15, which most gun owners use legally.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that following the MIND diet, even when started later in life, may significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The MIND diet combines elements of the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet, emphasizing brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil. Participants who closely followed the MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over 10 years had a 25% lower risk. The study suggests that adopting a healthy diet can be beneficial for preventing dementia at any stage of life.</p>

This trend is driven by the shift in office attendance due to remote work, which has led to record-high vacancy rates.</p>
