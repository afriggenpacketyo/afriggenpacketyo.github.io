          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, raising concerns among health workers. In 2024, over 140,000 older Americans were homeless, and this number is projected to triple by 2030. Factors contributing to this trend include the aging Baby Boomer population, high unemployment rates in the 1980s, and rising housing costs. This demographic often faces complex chronic medical conditions and ends up hospitalized at high rates, straining healthcare systems. Healthcare in Action CEO Dr. Indu Subaiya fears that rising costs and potential cuts to government programs like Medicaid will worsen the situation for seniors. </p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and bolster its defense industry. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote Japan's defense exports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a policy shift. This move is driven by the need to enhance interoperability with allies and develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon imports. By exporting arms, Japan seeks to standardize maintenance processes, create joint training opportunities, and achieve economies of scale in domestic production. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will cut short his attendance at the G7 summit in Canada due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. The White House stated that Trump would participate in key events before returning to Washington a day ahead of schedule. This decision follows a series of developments in the Israel-Iran conflict, including warnings from Trump to residents in Tehran to evacuate immediately. Trump's early departure disrupts planned discussions on the Middle East and a joint statement urging de-escalation, as the situation raises concerns about potential U.S. involvement in a broader regional war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has instructed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities. This directive follows protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Trump claims these cities use undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. The administration has also directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels due to concerns about the impact on key industries. </p>
