          <p>Former President Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on the golf course at his Turnberry resort. Amid a significant police presence and some protests, his visit is not purely recreational, as he is scheduled to meet with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade relations. Trump has expressed a 50-50 chance of reaching a trade agreement, which could avert potential tariffs. He is also expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney later in the visit to discuss trade and other international issues.</p>

          <p>With skin cancer cases on the rise, health experts are re-emphasizing the importance of using sunscreen for protection against harmful UV radiation. The article delves into the two main types of sunscreens—organic (chemical) and physical (mineral)—explaining how they both work to block UVA and UVB rays. While acknowledging public concerns and ongoing research into the safety of some long-used chemical ingredients like oxybenzone, scientists stress that the proven cancer-prevention benefits of sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks. They also caution against homemade remedies and advise on proper application, highlighting that using sunscreen remains a critical public health measure.</p>

          <h2>Israel Initiates Daily 10-Hour Humanitarian Pauses in Parts of Gaza Amid Hunger Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 06:29:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in three areas of the Gaza Strip to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid, as international concern over starvation escalates. The pauses are scheduled for 10 hours each day in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, while military operations continue elsewhere. This move follows months of severe aid restrictions and growing global criticism over the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory. While Israel states the measure is to increase aid flow, Hamas officials dismissed it as a public relations effort, and local health officials stress the need for a massive influx of supplies to save lives.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters across the U.S. seem unfazed by his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews in states like Pennsylvania and Florida reveal a constituency that remains fiercely loyal, often dismissing the issue as a politically motivated distraction by Democrats and the media. These voters prioritize what they see as Trump's successes on the economy and border security over the controversy. While polls suggest a portion of the Republican base is concerned, many are willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt, reflecting a deep-seated trust in him over other institutions.</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the scientific community must abandon the myth of being objective and apolitical to effectively counter contemporary political threats and build a more just future. The authors contend that science has always been entangled with politics, citing historical examples where research was used to justify racism and eugenics, and modern instances where it reflects capitalist or patriarchal values. By denying these political entanglements, scientists are ill-equipped to defend against bad-faith attacks and risk enabling oppressive systems. The piece calls for scientists to embrace political analysis as part of their work, making science more honest and resilient.</p>

Zirconium alloys are prized for their extreme heat and corrosion resistance, making them essential for components in scramjet engines and other high-performance aerospace and defense applications.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown has profoundly transformed the U.S.-Mexico border region, particularly around El Paso and Ciudad Juárez. The report details a dramatic drop in migrant crossings due to policies like an asylum ban, mass deportations, and border militarization, leaving migrant shelters in Mexico largely empty. Many migrants in the U.S. are choosing to "self-deport" out of fear, while local economies on both sides suffer from tariff uncertainty and factory layoffs. The creation of new military "national defense zones" has further restricted movement, altering a landscape that was once a hub of migration into one defined by fear and economic instability.</p>

One columnist argues against the move, stating it would betray the will of California voters who established an independent commission and could lead to long-term negative consequences for democracy. The other columnist contends that in the face of a perceived existential threat to democracy from authoritarianism, such a move could be a necessary form of "peaceful resistance" to ensure a functional check on power in Congress, even if it means compromising on principles temporarily.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the term "Alligator Alcatraz," used to describe a Florida immigrant detention facility, is a modern-day extension of a deeply racist historical trope. The author draws a parallel to the post-Civil War era, when images and products depicting Black babies as "alligator bait" were used to dehumanize and justify violence against African Americans. The piece contends that such language, whether historical or contemporary, serves to mock, threaten, and strip a targeted group of its humanity, framing vulnerable people as dangerous criminals deserving of cruelty.

A planned direct trip from Berlin to the North Sea island of Föhr turned into a series of unexpected train changes, delays caused by sheep on the tracks, and a journey terminated early due to crew working hours. The personal essay reflects a broader national issue of underinvestment in rail infrastructure, leading to dilapidated tracks and staff shortages.

The article explores the reasons for this disparity, with Poland being the sole team from the region at the latest Euros. Experts point to a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors, including a lack of investment, infrastructure, and societal acceptance for female athletes in traditionally patriarchal cultures. While UEFA initiatives are starting to make a difference, the legacy of post-communist economic struggles and the rise of conservative values continue to pose significant hurdles for the growth of the women's game in the region.</p>

Furthermore, many investors are operating on the belief that the president's aggressive rhetoric on tariffs is a negotiating tactic and that the final duties will be less severe. However, some experts remain cautious, warning that markets may be "priced for perfection" and vulnerable to a pullback as the real economic costs of tariffs materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed how a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster named James Kenny orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a major lineup including Glastonbury headliners and was billed as a 45,000-capacity, hydrogen-powered festival. Kenny managed to convince industry professionals, employees, and suppliers with false claims of major investors and government backing. However, the scheme unraveled as deposits were never paid, licenses were not applied for, and promised payments to staff and vendors never materialized, leaving many out of pocket and exposing a festival that existed only on paper.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing reforms to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales aimed at protecting pubs and music venues from noise complaints, which often threaten their existence. Under the new plans, developers building new homes near existing venues would be required to soundproof the properties. The changes also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses opening in disused shops and for al fresco dining areas. The government hopes these measures will help reverse the steady decline of the pub industry by cutting red tape and supporting hospitality businesses facing economic pressures.</p>

However, the ambitious vision faces significant hurdles, including the need for an estimated $4 billion in funding, which will rely heavily on private sector buy-in.
