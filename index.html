        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to acquire German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of Â£116 million, including a guaranteed Â£100 million plus Â£16 million in potential add-ons. The bonus payments would only be triggered if Liverpool achieves significant success, potentially setting a new British record. Wirtz reportedly favored a move to Anfield, leading to negotiations that resulted in a fee lower than Leverkusen's initial valuation of approximately Â£126 million. Manchester City and Bayern Munich had also shown interest in Wirtz but ultimately withdrew due to cost considerations. </p>

          <p>Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory in response to an overnight missile strike by Israel that reportedly killed several senior Iranian military leaders. Israel stated its attack targeted Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, accusing Tehran of running a secret nuclear bomb program. Rocket sirens were activated in northern Jordan, with Jordanian state media reporting interceptions of Iranian drones within its airspace. The news of the strikes caused oil prices to surge and stock markets in Asia and Europe to decline, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid fears of a wider regional conflict. </p>

          <p>The High Court has rejected a legal challenge against the government's decision to add VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1 across the UK. Families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights, particularly for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). The government defended the policy, estimating it would raise Â£1.8 billion annually by 2029/30 to improve state sector standards. The court acknowledged the policy's interference with some human rights but found the government entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. </p>

          <p>Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester charged with assaulting a federal officer, claims he was brutally attacked by law enforcement during a demonstration against immigration raids. Mojica says he was trying to de-escalate tensions when officers took him to the ground, held him in a chokehold, and caused injuries to his face and body. His lawyer argues that authorities are criminalizing free speech and misrepresenting events. Mojica's arrest is part of a larger wave of prosecutions against protesters who have been accused of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers. </p>

Alleged incidents occurred between 2001 and 2009, with some men claiming Tait drugged them before the assaults. </p>

          <p>A military parade celebrating the US army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with Donald Trump's birthday, is set to take place in Washington, featuring tanks, missiles, and a flypast. Critics express concern over the authoritarian symbolism of the event, drawing parallels to military parades in countries like North Korea and Russia. The parade is seen as an effort to aggrandize Trump's ego and link his projection of power with military authority. Public opposition is planned through protest events across the country. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is poised to cut the US Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD), an office that works to rein in noise and light pollution in national parks. Advocates say the division's work is vital for plants, animals, and the overall sensory experience of national parks. The proposed cuts to the National Park Service's stewardship budget threaten the NSNSD's ability to protect natural and cultural resources. The NSNSD has played a key role in improving lighting at parks and preserving natural darkness. </p>

          <p>Unite Here Local 11, the union representing Southern California hospitality workers, has accused a group of airlines and hotel businesses of using misleading tactics in support of a petition to overturn a city ordinance boosting the minimum wage in Los Angeles. The union filed a complaint alleging that petition circulators have made false statements and misrepresentations to convince voters to support the measure. The business coalition, known as the L.A. Alliance for Tourism, Jobs and Progress, is seeking to overturn the ordinance, contending that it will hurt the industry and thwart the development of new hotels. The group needs to gather about 93,000 signatures by the end of June to qualify the measure for the ballot. </p>

          <p>The California Public Health Department has rescinded its efforts to suspend the license of Brier Oak on Sunset, a Hollywood nursing home, after determining that the AA violation notices were based on citation issuance date, not the date of the incidents that gave rise to the citations. The state's investigation had found that staff oversights at Brier Oak led to the deaths of two residents in 2022 and 2024. The facility was found to be severely understaffed at the time of one patient's death, leading to a $1.29 million arbitration award for the family. License suspension efforts are still proceeding against other facilities. </p>

          <p>An upcoming parade in Washington celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, promoted by President Trump, is criticized for prioritizing equipment over the service of military personnel. The author, a 25-year Army veteran, argues that true honor lies in acknowledging the unique role of those in uniform while appreciating the sacrifices of civilians. The author suggests a modest acknowledgment is appropriate, emphasizing that soldiers are not special but rather come from the same communities as everyone else. The author concludes by advocating for a brief moment of direct eye contact and genuine words of appreciation as the most meaningful way to honor military service. </p>

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully dismantling buildings for reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach creates a circular economy by keeping waste out of landfills and reducing the carbon footprint of construction. Cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., are leading the way, but widespread adoption requires local infrastructure for processing and distributing salvaged materials. While deconstruction can be more expensive and time-consuming than traditional demolition, some local governments are incentivizing or requiring it to promote sustainability. </p>
