          <p>A Republican senator has voiced resistance to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill," suggesting it could face obstacles in the Senate unless significant changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit instead of reducing it, advocating for deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels. While Speaker Johnson urged the Senate to expedite the bill's passage with minimal modifications, Senator Paul opposed it due to concerns about the debt ceiling. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion, while Speaker Johnson argues it will stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for allegedly rigging interest rates, raising concerns about potential miscarriages of justice. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating Libor and Euribor, benchmarks used to set interest rates on mortgages and loans. The traders argue they were scapegoated, as evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a larger scale. A US appeal court previously decided such conduct wasn't a crime, leading to the revocation of charges against Hayes in the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will delay the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union from June 1 until July 9 to allow time for negotiations with the bloc. This decision came after a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had told Trump that she “wants to get down to serious negotiations.” In a social media post Friday, Trump had threatened to impose the 50% tariff on EU goods, complaining that the 27-member bloc had been “very difficult to deal with” on trade and that negotiations were “going nowhere.”</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a contentious refereeing decision during their match at Old Trafford. The dispute centers on a disallowed goal, with Villa arguing that the referee prematurely blew the whistle before their player gained clear possession. Football Association laws state that VAR can only intervene in cases of "clear and obvious error," but the referee's early whistle negated this option. Pundits and Villa's captain have expressed frustration, highlighting the significant impact of the decision on their Champions League qualification hopes.</p>

Accordingly, we should expect more ups and downs in bilateral relations in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After years of studying parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework has been developed called emotionally safe parenting. This style focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as stress signals. This approach involves internal work, setting boundaries with empathy, preventing shame, and prioritizing communication.</p>

          <p>The BBC returned to Gaza to document the dire situation of Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old baby suffering from severe malnutrition due to the Israeli blockade. Siwar's mother and grandmother are struggling to provide her with the special milk formula she needs because of an allergic reaction, as well as other essential supplies. The BBC correspondent notes the overall situation in Gaza is dire, with widespread hunger and lack of access to clean water. The story highlights the devastating impact of the conflict on civilians, particularly vulnerable children.</p>
