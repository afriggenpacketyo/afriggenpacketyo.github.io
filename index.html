          <p>President Trump's repeated suggestions of seeking a third term, despite constitutional term limits, have sparked debate.  The 22nd Amendment explicitly prohibits more than two terms, while the 12th Amendment addresses presidential eligibility. Legal scholars offer varying interpretations, with some suggesting hypothetical scenarios that could circumvent the amendments, though the likelihood of success remains uncertain.</p>
