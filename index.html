          <p>According to the BBC, the Israeli embassy in London was the suspected target of a terror plot involving five Iranian men who were arrested on Saturday. While police have not confirmed the embassy as the target, citing operational reasons, the BBC's report indicates the Times' initial report is accurate. Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism command acknowledged a "fast-moving" investigation and the inability to provide further details. Iran's foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, has denied any involvement and offered assistance with the investigation, indicating a willingness to cooperate with authorities to resolve the matter.</p>

          <p>Following weeks of heightened tensions stemming from a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, leading both sides to assess the outcomes and claim victory. India emphasized that its actions were limited and targeted, while Pakistan focused on its claims of downing Indian aircraft. Diplomats and analysts hope that these events might provide an opportunity for de-escalation through back-channel conversations, potentially averting a full-scale war. The article notes that Pakistan's economic situation makes a protracted conflict undesirable, and India's limited action may quell public anger following the Kashmir attack.</p>

          <p>Russia initiated a 72-hour ceasefire in Ukraine, beginning early Thursday to coincide with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations. The cessation of hostilities, which saw calm over Ukrainian skies after a day of Russian air attacks, is set to last until midnight Saturday-Sunday Moscow time. While it's unclear if frontline fighting will also pause, the ceasefire coincides with military parades in Moscow attended by President Putin and other leaders. Ukraine, however, views the truce as a deceptive maneuver by Putin and continues to support a US-backed 30-day ceasefire proposal, indicating a divergence in strategies for conflict resolution.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is anticipated to announce a framework for a trade agreement with the UK, though specifics remain unclear and require Congressional approval. Discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, as well as reducing taxes on US technology companies. However, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted lowering food production standards to facilitate trade of US agricultural products, prioritizing a separate agreement with the EU. A draft deal proposes reduced tariffs on British exports of steel, aluminum, and cars in exchange for a lower digital services tax.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has alarmed the British film industry, which is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes. British studios rely heavily on Hollywood blockbusters, and uncertainty about tariffs could reverse recent progress. The British government is in discussions with the US administration regarding the potential tariffs. Trade experts question the enforceability of film tariffs, given the increasingly international nature of film production, and suggest that increased American tax breaks are more likely.</p>

          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians in West Bank cities, raising fears of potential annexation. The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has resulted in the longest-running Israeli presence in the heart of West Bank cities in decades. While Israel claims the campaign aims to curb militancy, the extended presence undermines the Palestinian Authority and has led to the destruction of homes and infrastructure. Palestinians fear a second nakba and accuse Israel of signaling intent to annex the territory, a concern fueled by hard-line ministers in the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second expert in smartphone forensics testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's remains were found, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened earlier. Jessica Hyde's testimony supported previous expert testimony, asserting that the earlier timestamp was related to opening a browser tab, not the search itself. The defense questioned Hyde's methodology and referenced a previous case to challenge her reliability, but the judge restricted certain lines of questioning. The trial centers on whether Read intentionally struck O'Keefe with her car.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast, which traveled up to 800 kilometers. This launch, the sixth missile test by North Korea in 2025, is a violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Experts suggest the tests may be aimed at assessing missiles for potential export to Russia, who has been accused of using North Korean missiles in its war against Ukraine.</p>
