          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 43 deaths, including 15 children, in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in under an hour, overwhelming communities and a children's summer camp, where dozens of campers remain missing. Hundreds of people have been rescued, with some found clinging to trees, as state and federal authorities mount a massive search and rescue operation. Officials noted that the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, catching many residents and campers by surprise in the middle of the night.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in southern Gaza when assailants attacked a food distribution site operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The U.S. and the foundation have accused Hamas of carrying out the attack, though no evidence was provided. The incident occurred amidst ongoing violence, with separate Israeli airstrikes reportedly killing 14 people, including a doctor and his children, in the Muwasi area. This bloodshed continues as diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire gain some traction, highlighting the volatile and dangerous conditions for both civilians and humanitarian personnel in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli government has announced it will send a negotiating team to Qatar for indirect ceasefire talks, signaling a potential step forward in diplomatic efforts. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office simultaneously stated that the changes requested by Hamas to the U.S.-mediated proposal are "unacceptable to Israel." This mixed message underscores the significant hurdles that remain in reaching an agreement to halt the nearly 21-month-long war. The development comes as Netanyahu prepares to meet with President Trump in Washington, with the international community closely watching the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old girl in Buena Park, California, was fatally struck by illegal fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration. According to police, a homeowner had set up a large fireworks display in the street which began to misfire, igniting other illegal fireworks stored nearby. The subsequent explosion struck the child, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. The homeowner has been arrested as the investigation continues. The incident was one of several deadly or dangerous fireworks-related events across California during the holiday, highlighting the significant risks of unsanctioned displays.</p>

She stated that the Trump administration is working to upgrade what she described as "ancient" and "neglected" technology within the National Weather Service and NOAA to provide faster alerts. While a flood watch was issued, the storm's intensity and sudden stall were not fully predicted, leading to the catastrophic event. Noem assured that the federal government is committed to fixing systemic failures to ensure families have more advance notice in the future.</p>

          <p>Many young people struggle to find summer jobs due to a lack of previous work experience, creating a frustrating "vicious cycle." However, careers experts suggest several ways to stand out to employers in retail, hospitality, and other sectors.

Experts also advise tailoring cover letters, preparing for interviews with specific examples, and not being afraid to speculatively drop off a CV at local businesses, as it shows initiative.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's foreign policy, arguing he employs the "Madman Theory"—a strategy of deliberate unpredictability designed to coerce concessions from both allies and adversaries. This approach has unsettled traditional alliances, such as NATO, but has also successfully pressured European members to dramatically increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP. While effective in some cases, the article questions whether this doctrine can work against entrenched adversaries like Russia and Iran, or if it ultimately undermines U.S. credibility. The strategy marks a significant shift from decades of American foreign policy, prioritizing transactional gains over long-term stability.</p>

While some savers have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, others criticize its significant drawbacks. Key concerns include a penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers some of their own money and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been updated since 2017. Critics, including financial expert Martin Lewis, argue these rules are unfair and are calling for reforms to make the product more flexible for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

The billionaire claims the party's goal is to "give you back your freedom" and serve as an alternative to the two-party system. This move comes after a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. Musk suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot in the neck after responding to a call about a suspicious person outside an ICE detention facility on the night of July Fourth. Officials state that when the officer arrived, an unknown number of armed suspects opened fire in an apparent ambush. The injured officer was treated at a hospital and has since been released. Several suspects, some reportedly wearing body armor, were taken into custody after a pursuit. A federal source indicated the group had vandalized the facility and used fireworks to lure law enforcement to the scene.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as Western nations seek to engage with the new government following the collapse of the Assad regime. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future" but acknowledged the country's fragile situation, including concerns over the protection of minority groups and the increasing enforcement of Islamic practices. The UK has lifted sanctions and is providing humanitarian aid to encourage a move toward peace, inclusivity, and stability. However, the new government, largely formed from a formerly proscribed group, faces international scrutiny over its commitment to human rights and democratic governance.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, stating it is prepared to enter new negotiations on implementation details.

While this marks a significant development, key issues like the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released and guarantees for a permanent end to the war remain unresolved.

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point after one of its trustees delivered an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon following the October 7 Hamas attacks. The sermon reportedly included a hadith about Muslims fighting Jews without providing appropriate context, which the regulator deemed misconduct, especially given the timing. The trustee has been disqualified from holding a senior charity role for three years. This case is one of over 300 related to the Middle East conflict that the commission is investigating, highlighting its focus on preventing charities from being used to promote hate.</p>

Needing an almost impossible 536 runs on the final day for a win, the team must decide whether to risk defeat by chasing the target or attempt to bat out the day for a draw to preserve their series lead. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick has hinted for the first time that the team may be flexible on its win-at-all-costs mantra, acknowledging a draw is a possible and logical outcome. The decision will be a crucial test of the team's identity under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift, Subaru has been named the most reliable car brand for 2025 by Consumer Reports, surpassing perennial leaders Toyota and Lexus. The survey, based on data from over 300,000 vehicles, gave Subaru the top score, likely due to its conservative redesigns, shared components across a smaller model lineup, and strong individual model ratings. The Subaru Forester received a near-perfect reliability score of 98 out of 100. While Toyota and its luxury division Lexus still ranked second and third, their overall scores were impacted by reliability issues with the redesigned Tacoma and Tundra pickup trucks.
