The program, previously referred to as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028.

Merck anticipates orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments before the RSV season starts. The shot reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreased hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared with a placebo among infants through five months, according to mid- to late-stage trials.</p>

Silver has industrial properties that could increase its value, and it can diversify a portfolio and hedge against inflation.

The poll also indicates a record disagreement on the morality of abortion, with 57% of women and 40% of men viewing it as moral.

          <h2>Warner Bros. Discovery Split Casts Doubt on Future of TNT Sports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 15:51:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is splitting into two separate companies, raising questions about the future of TNT Sports. One company will focus on streaming and studios, while the other, Global Networks, will house legacy cable networks, TNT Sports, and digital products. The future of TNT Sports' live sports rights is uncertain without the streaming portfolio of Warner Bros. Discovery. The CEO of Streaming and Studios said that it will be up to the Global Networks team to decide where to license TNT Sports programming, potentially leading to a merger with another entity or a licensing deal with a different media company.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed actor Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and the New York Times. The lawsuit was filed after Lively alleged sexual harassment during the making of the 2024 movie *It Ends With Us*, directed by Baldoni, which coincided with a New York Times article detailing public relations efforts on Baldoni's behalf. Judge Lewis J. Liman stated that Baldoni failed to demonstrate actual malice in Lively's allegations. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, calling the lawsuit a sham.</p>

Demand for these minerals is projected to increase significantly by 2040, but their uneven distribution across the world raises concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. The United States is a major consumer but not a significant producer of these minerals, leading to efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies.
