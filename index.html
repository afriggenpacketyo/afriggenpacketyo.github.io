          <p>A shooting at a high school in Graz, Austria, resulted in multiple fatalities, with authorities confirming that a 21-year-old former student carried out the attack before killing himself. The incident prompted a large-scale police operation, including the deployment of a helicopter, to secure the school and evacuate students and teachers. Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker declared three days of national mourning, expressing the country's shock and grief, while flags were flown at half-mast. European leaders, including the chancellor of Germany and the President of the European Commission, conveyed their condolences, emphasizing the importance of safety in schools. The tragic event has prompted reflection on Austria's gun laws, which permit revolvers, pistols, and semi-automatic weapons with a permit.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is increasingly aligned with the crypto industry, as evidenced by speeches from Trump family members at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference. The Trump administration has rolled back regulations and dropped lawsuits against crypto firms, encouraging investment in digital currencies, which could benefit Trump's own crypto ventures. Trump Media is also pivoting to crypto, creating a corporate bitcoin reserve to tie its stock price to bitcoin's value, mirroring the White House's announcement of a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve." Trump's campaign promise to fire the SEC Chair has further solidified his pro-crypto stance, blurring the lines between pro-Trump and pro-crypto agendas. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth defended the deployment of troops to Los Angeles, asserting the need to protect ICE agents in the execution of their duties and enforce immigration law.

Approximately 700 active-duty Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area to integrate with National Guard troops, aiming to protect federal personnel and property. Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration, arguing that the Title 10 invocation was unlawful because it bypassed the governor's authority, and the lawsuit claims that the protests did not warrant such a deployment.

Trade tensions, particularly international discord, have significantly impacted the economic outlook, affecting both the U.S. and the Euro area.

The revised policy will extend the payment, worth up to Â£300 a year, to nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less. Starmer explained that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and new trade deals enabled the government to increase eligibility for the payment, reversing an earlier decision to restrict it to the poorest pensioners.

          <p>DeMarcus Cousins was ejected from a game in Puerto Rico following a heated confrontation with a fan, escalating into a near-chaotic situation. The incident began with a verbal altercation during a timeout, where Cousins grabbed his crotch at a fan who responded with an obscene gesture. As Cousins left the court, fans booed, threw drinks, and food, prompting him to shout back and make an obscene gesture. The moment drew comparisons to the "Malice at the Palace" incident, with Cousins being physically restrained by teammates and security before being escorted to the locker room.
