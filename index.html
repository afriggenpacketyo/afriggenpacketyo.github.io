        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thomas Friedman's article posits that President Trump's governing style is characterized by unchecked gut impulses, lacking homework or coordination among agencies. This approach could lead to disastrous outcomes, as decisions are made without careful consideration or expert input. The article emphasizes the potential risks associated with such an unstructured and impulsive leadership style, particularly in complex and critical areas of governance. The lack of coordination and homework raises concerns about the stability and effectiveness of the administration's policies. The article suggests the need for a more structured and informed decision-making process to mitigate potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights leader, along with other vessels named after civil rights figures. This move is seen as aligning with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." Documents obtained by CBS News reveal proposed timelines for the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk, sparking criticism from Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem Jeffries, and Chuck Schumer, who view it as a shameful erasure of history. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's directive to cease heritage month events further underscores the administration's focus on unity within the ranks.</p>

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an investigation, describing the situation as "unconscionable" and accusing Israel of weaponizing aid.

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren's office has released a report detailing alleged ethical violations by Elon Musk during his tenure in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

These actions are described as violating norms and raising concerns about corruption and conflicts of interest. The report's findings are based on Musk's 130 days in office, during which he oversaw efforts to cut federal spending.</p>

          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, declared dead by a coroner, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians noticed signs of life, leading to her immediate transport to a hospital. This rare medical occurrence is known as the Lazarus Effect, where a patient shows signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead, often following CPR. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the Lazarus Effect typically occurs after a cardiac arrest and the administration of CPR, with 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. between 1982 and 2022.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, 2025, after a nine-year hiatus. The popular item, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was removed in 2016 due to kitchen complexity. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a simplified recipe to ensure faster service. The company acknowledged the demand from fans, pointing to a Change.org petition with nearly 19,000 signatures.</p>

          <h2>US Proposes Interim Step in Iran Nuclear Talks Allowing Some Enrichment</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed an interim step in Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This proposal aims to facilitate a broader agreement that would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The outline represents a potential compromise to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program while negotiations continue. The proposal's success depends on both sides' willingness to accept the interim measures and work towards a comprehensive, long-term solution.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the U.S. and continue receiving lifesaving medical care. The decision reverses an earlier notification that her parole would be revoked, potentially leading to deportation. She has been receiving treatment for short bowel syndrome since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023, which is necessary for her survival. Humanitarian parole, which does not provide a path to citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to address individual emergencies.</p>
