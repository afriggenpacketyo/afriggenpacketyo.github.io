          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate reached 2.1% in May, according to preliminary data from Destatis, edging slightly above analyst expectations of 2% but approaching the European Central Bank's 2% target. This figure is harmonized across the Eurozone for comparability, and follows a 2.2% reading in April. While Germany's consumer price index has been nearing the ECB's target in recent months, uncertainty persists regarding the country's economic outlook. Domestic and global issues, including potential impacts from U.S. tariffs and the implementation of new government policies, continue to influence economic expectations. The ECB is scheduled to make its next interest rate decision on June 5, with a high probability of a quarter-point interest rate reduction priced in. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S.-China trade negotiations have reached a standstill, requiring direct intervention from President Trump and President Xi Jinping, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in an interview with Fox News. While further talks are expected in the coming weeks and a call between the leaders may occur, progress has been hampered by unresolved issues. Despite a breakthrough agreement in Switzerland on May 12 to roll back recent tariff increases, the U.S. has maintained tech restrictions on Beijing, and China has not significantly eased restrictions on rare earths. Bessent emphasized the need for the leaders to engage directly given the magnitude and complexity of the talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, coinciding with efforts by the Trump administration to demonstrate support for the sector. Binance has recently partnered with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council.</p>

Zhou's breakthrough may transform the ABC conjecture from conceptual abstraction to a computationally usable tool. The feat, achieved during weekends between gruelling 14-hour shifts as a Beijing algorithm engineer, not only revives Mochizuki’s controversial theory but threatens to eclipse Andrew Wiles’ famed 1995 proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem in scope. Professor Ivan Fesenko, a leading IUT authority, declared that Zhou's results are infinitely stronger than Wiles’.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly attempting a "reverse Nixon" strategy, aiming to draw Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage in geopolitical competition with China. This strategy, reminiscent of Nixon's opening to China to counter the Soviet Union, seeks to isolate China, guarantee European security, and solidify American global primacy. However, this plan carries the risk of backfiring, potentially fracturing the American alliance with Europe without successfully splitting Russia from China. Analysts suggest that the deep bond between Russia and China, driven by mutual antipathy toward the United States and economic ties, may make this strategy difficult to achieve.</p>

Her paintings feature torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricately arranged updos, often cropped or angled to never show faces. Ramberg's work captures the dueling reactions of fascination and repulsion towards the construction of femininity, highlighting the interplay between unruly and taming forces. The artist's exploration of hidden desires and the artificiality of self-presentation offers a complex and thought-provoking commentary on the expectations placed on women.</p>

She highlights Machiavelli's republicanism, emphasizing his belief in shared power and the importance of checking power within a government. Benner also suggests that Machiavelli's insights are relevant to contemporary politics, particularly in understanding the rise of leaders like Trump and the importance of maintaining democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, is on track to receive a bonus worth over €100 million, potentially one of the largest payouts in European corporate history.

O'Leary will have the option to receive 10 million shares, contingent on his continued employment with the airline until the end of July 2028. O'Leary has been with Ryanair since 1988 and has been instrumental in the airline's growth into Europe's largest low-cost carrier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI, valued at $300 billion, is grappling with the tension between its initial nonprofit mission and the pressure to compete in the for-profit AI industry. Originally founded to develop safe and beneficial AI, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to attract investors, but its rapid growth with ChatGPT has led to calls for a transition to a fully for-profit model. This shift has sparked concerns from former employees, AI experts, and regulators, who fear it could compromise the company's commitment to responsible AI development. While OpenAI maintains that its goal is to benefit humanity, the definition of “safe” and “beneficial” remains subjective and subject to the company's board.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan solution is emerging to address the financial burden of childbirth in America, where privately insured families face out-of-pocket costs of nearly $3,000 on average.

The bill has gained support from organizations across the political spectrum, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and anti-abortion groups.

The highest levels were detected in beer brewed in areas with known PFAS contamination, such as the Cape Fear River Basin in North Carolina.

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has stated that the shifting geopolitical landscape presents an opportunity to raise the euro's international status. Lagarde believes that the euro could gain greater global influence with the right policy mix, including a commitment to open trade, stronger security capabilities, and a reinforcement of economic and legal foundations. A euro with raised reserve currency status would bring benefits to Europe, including lower borrowing costs and protection from sanctions. Market watchers are divided on the euro's potential to seize some of the dollar's share of global FX holdings. (not investment advice)</p>
