          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant policy change, adding a $100,000 one-time fee for new H-1B visa applications for workers currently outside the United States. White House officials clarified that this fee will not apply to current visa holders or renewals, but will affect future applicants in the next lottery cycle. The stated purpose of this measure is to encourage companies to hire American workers and ensure that foreign workers are exceptionally high-skilled and not undercutting domestic wages. This policy directly impacts major tech companies that rely on the H-1B program to recruit foreign talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The announcement of a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas has sent shockwaves through the technology sector and among foreign governments, particularly India. Major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase reportedly advised their visa-holding employees to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel due to the uncertainty. India's Ministry of External Affairs expressed concern, stating the measure is likely to have significant "humanitarian consequences" by disrupting families. The move is seen as the administration's most aggressive step to date in restricting legal, employment-based immigration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Being 'Fat but Fit' May Be Healthier Than Being Underweight</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 17:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale Danish study from Aarhus University Hospital challenges long-held beliefs about body mass index (BMI) and health risks. Researchers found that underweight individuals were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than those with a BMI at the high end of the normal range. The findings suggest that being overweight or moderately obese did not correlate with higher death rates compared to those in the upper-normal BMI category. This supports the concept of being "fat but fit," indicating that factors like body fat distribution and overall fitness are more critical than BMI alone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major shift in British foreign policy, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state. This decision follows a deadline given to Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, conditions which ministers believe have not been met amid worsening violence and settlement expansion. The move has drawn strong criticism from the Israeli government and some Conservative figures, who argue it rewards terrorism. However, the UK government contends it is a necessary step to preserve the possibility of a long-term peace deal.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills designed to protect immigrants from the Trump administration's heightened enforcement actions. A key piece of legislation, the "No Secret Police Act," bans federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty in the state. Other new laws limit immigration agents' access to nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant. Newsom framed the legislation as a necessary pushback against what he described as authoritarian tactics and a "terror campaign" by federal immigration authorities.</p>

White House officials denied direct involvement in the network's decision, but the incident has sparked a fierce debate about free speech, cancel culture, and the potential for government pressure to influence media content.</p>

The new strategy aims to position the party as the true patriots, in contrast to figures like Nigel Farage, whom they have labeled a "plastic patriot."

          <p>In her book "Love by Design," social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh identifies respect as a fundamental ingredient for a successful romantic relationship. She warns that a lack of respect is a major red flag that can manifest in various ways, from minor inconsiderate actions to a partner consistently devaluing your priorities or identity. Over time, this behavior can severely damage a person's self-esteem and sense of self. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that people enter relationships to be seen and valued, and a persistent lack of respect undermines this core need.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 deadline to fund the government fast approaching, top congressional Democrats have requested a meeting with President Trump to avert a shutdown. In a letter, Senate and House Democratic leaders accused their Republican counterparts of refusing to engage in bipartisan negotiations on a spending bill. After the House passed a short-term funding measure that failed in the Senate, both parties appear entrenched, with each side poised to blame the other if Congress fails to act and federal agencies are forced to close.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with states that have "sanctuary" policies by threatening legal action and the withholding of federal funds. In letters to the attorneys general of California, New York, and Illinois, the acting ICE director warned that their refusal to honor immigration detainers could lead to lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice. These states have laws that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents, often requiring a judicial warrant. The administration argues these policies endanger communities by releasing criminals.</p>

          <p>Joanna Page, star of the popular UK sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has alleged in her new book that she was groped by a television host during a filming session.

Page states that when the host began groping her, she hit his hands and verbally confronted him, after which he stopped. She described the producer's warning as a bizarre but common experience in the industry at the time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new powers to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, thereby saving nearly 800 jobs. After the company announced the closure, the Commerce Secretary reportedly intervened, exercising the administration's "golden share" rights, which were a condition of the recent takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. This national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures, marking a significant instance of direct government intervention in the private sector.

          <p>A study published by China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute details a new artificial intelligence system claimed to be capable of detecting even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy. The system reportedly processes data from multiple sources like sonar buoys and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While Western experts acknowledge AI's potential in anti-submarine warfare, they remain skeptical about its immediate ability to upend global naval strategy, viewing such announcements partly as psychological warfare in an ongoing technological arms race.</p>

Among the names being considered are Nuno Espirito Santo and a possible short-term return for former manager Slaven Bilic. Despite the early stage of the season, the club's proactive search for alternatives suggests Potter's future at the London Stadium is uncertain.</p>

Political science experts have expressed alarm at her proposal, warning that history, particularly the Civil War, shows that such a separation would not be peaceful and that the rhetoric itself is dangerous in a highly polarized environment.</p>
