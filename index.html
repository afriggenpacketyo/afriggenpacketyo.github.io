          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries this week in the Oval Office, as Congress faces an impending government shutdown. Democratic leaders confirmed the meeting, stating their intention to address critical issues such as rising costs and the Republican healthcare crisis, while stressing the urgency of avoiding a "Republican-caused shutdown." This high-stakes discussion follows weeks of legislative deadlock and the failure of competing short-term funding proposals in the Senate, which has left the government's funding status uncertain past the September 30th deadline. With both chambers currently in recess, lawmakers are on standby, ready to reconvene if a shutdown occurs, highlighting the critical nature of this upcoming meeting to resolve the budget impasse.</p>

This announcement follows his limited solo touring since leaving the band and recent public appearances with former bandmate Louis Tomlinson, which ignited widespread fan speculation about potential new music or collaborations. Malik, a self-proclaimed lifelong gamer who also released a new song for the video game Borderlands 4, has previously spoken candidly about his struggles with live performance anxiety. Despite past challenges, this residency is seen by many fans as a sign of a major comeback, with tickets going on general sale this Friday.</p>

The group highlighted numerous cases, including an insurer initially refusing a cancelled holiday claim because the trip had technically begun, and accused the industry of serious failings in sales practices and clarity of policy coverage. While the Association of British Insurers stated members work hard to assist customers and handle claims efficiently, Which? argues that acceptance rates for home and travel claims are significantly lower than for car insurance. This major intervention demands a response within 90 days from the Financial Conduct Authority, which has acknowledged past issues in insurers' claims handling.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has extended its production shutdown until at least October 1st, stemming from a cyber attack in late August that crippled its IT networks. The prolonged halt is costing the company an estimated £50 million weekly, sparking grave concerns about the financial viability of its extensive supply chain, particularly for smaller businesses. In response, the Business Secretary and Industry Minister are visiting JLR to engage with the company and its suppliers, aiming to provide support and accelerate the return to full production. Politicians and union leaders are advocating for government intervention, including potential loans or a furlough scheme, to mitigate the severe economic consequences for thousands of employees and prevent widespread business failures within the affected supply network.</p>

          <p>US comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night talk show after Disney, ABC's parent company, reinstated him following a suspension over remarks concerning the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Disney initially suspended the show, citing "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, a decision made after a Trump-appointed FCC chair threatened to revoke ABC's broadcast license. This sparked a nationwide debate over free speech, drawing strong condemnation from civil liberties advocates and Hollywood figures. While Disney confirmed his return after "thoughtful conversations," some major ABC affiliates, like Sinclair, may not air the show, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding political commentary and media freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues against the growing trend of AI tools in parenting, such as party planners, lunchbox note translators, and AI-guided storytelling apps. While these tools promise to simplify tasks for overwhelmed parents, the author contends that outsourcing such intimate aspects of child-rearing risks eroding the essential human connection and intimacy between parents and children. Relying on AI can lead to a loss of "tacit knowledge" about a child's unique needs and may foster an unhealthy "do-it-all" model of parenthood, rather than encouraging parents to trust their instincts or seek support from their human community. Ultimately, AI threatens to sap the humanness from the parenting experience.</p>

These charges stem from his tenure as mayor of Davao City and later as president, specifically citing his instruction and authorization of "violent acts including murder" against alleged criminals, including drug dealers and users. Duterte, arrested in March by Philippine authorities on an ICC warrant, is currently held at an ICC facility in the Netherlands, despite his past denials of authorizing extrajudicial killings.

Danish intelligence echoed this, citing a "high threat of sabotage" aimed at disruption and testing boundaries.

The author argues these acts are not for genuine grief but rather a politicized effort to enshrine Kirk's ideology into the national consciousness, reminiscent of neo-Confederate memorialization.

          <p>Amazon is heading to a long-awaited federal trial against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which alleges the company systematically deceived millions of customers into subscribing to Prime memberships and deliberately obstructed their attempts to cancel. The FTC contends that Amazon's sign-up process was unclear, with employees internally labeling the issue an "unspoken cancer," and describes the cancellation mechanism as a "labyrinthian" ordeal, internally referred to as "Iliad." Amazon, however, denies any wrongdoing, maintaining that its Prime sign-up and cancellation procedures are "clear and simple." A U.S. District Court Judge has already ruled that Amazon and two senior executives violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by gathering billing information before fully disclosing service terms, indicating potential individual liability for the executives in this significant legal battle.</p>

          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has defended the 2026 budget plans, asserting that the €126.7 billion investment in infrastructure, schools, and hospitals will secure jobs and boost growth, rather than merely filling gaps. This defense comes as the OECD cut its economic outlook for Germany, forecasting only 0.3% growth in 2025. Opposition parties accuse the coalition of increasing debt for tax breaks instead of real investment, while Klingbeil insists reforms are overdue and the government is rehabilitating neglected areas. Separately, Deutsche Bahn confirmed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO, making her the first woman to hold the position, though her appointment faced union opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's potential roadmap to "competitive authoritarianism" in the US, where democracy is eroded not through outright bans but by incrementally undermining the opposition's ability to compete fairly. The author highlights recent actions, such as pressure on Jimmy Kimmel's show and TikTok, as steps towards consolidating power by targeting financial and civil society support for Democrats. This approach involves perverting laws, weaponizing agencies, and bullying corporations to concentrate economic power with regime allies. The article emphasizes that preventing this future requires collective defiance from Congress, media, business, and citizens to fight against individual power grabs and uphold democratic principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed $100,000 fees for H-1B visa applications are expected to disproportionately harm US startups, founders, and venture capitalists. Industry experts warn that such a high cost would make it prohibitive for early-stage companies to hire skilled foreign workers in critical fields like IT and engineering, exacerbating existing talent shortages. This policy could lead to reduced entrepreneurship, dampen venture capital appetite for US startups, and potentially trigger a "brain drain" as international talent seeks opportunities in more welcoming markets like the UK and Europe. The uncertainty has already caused a significant spike in inquiries for immigration advice among startups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the second major hurricane of the Atlantic season, is currently tracking towards the Azores and mainland Europe, with its remnants anticipated to bring severe weather despite weakening over cooler waters. After rapidly intensifying near Bermuda, Gabrielle is now forecast to accelerate and disrupt the jet stream, making long-range predictions particularly challenging due to the potential for climate change to increase hurricane intensity and unpredictability. However, both major computer models now show a consistent path, indicating the low-pressure system will likely hit Portugal on Sunday, bringing large waves, strong winds, and heavy rain.
