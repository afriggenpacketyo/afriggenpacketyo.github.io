          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempts to drastically cut research funding to the National Science Foundation (NSF), a move that universities argued threatened critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the policy change, which capped indirect costs for universities at 15%, was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would have cost them nearly $100 million annually. This decision follows similar rulings against the administration's caps on grants from the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health. The article highlights the importance of research funding for maintaining advancements in various technological fields, emphasizing the potential negative impacts of such cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the United States has launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. According to Trump, all planes are safely returning after dropping a full payload of bombs on the primary site, Fordow. This decision marks a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran, engaging the American military in active warfare in the Middle East. The strikes come after weeks of Israeli strikes on Iran aimed at dismantling its air defenses, missile capabilities, and nuclear enrichment facilities, with experts suggesting the U.S. bunker-buster bombs were necessary to destroy heavily fortified sites like Fordow. The article underscores the shift from Trump's earlier stance of avoiding foreign conflicts and the potential ramifications of direct U.S. military action in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear program, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. This disagreement occurred as the White House claimed Iran had everything necessary to develop a nuclear weapon within weeks and as Trump considered joining Israel in strikes against Iran. Gabbard had testified that the U.S. intelligence community believed Iran was not actively building a nuclear weapon, but Trump dismissed this assessment, indicating he believed Iran was "very close to having one."
