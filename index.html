          <p>A man in Manavgat, Turkey, was seriously injured after being attacked by a lion that had escaped from a local zoo. The 53-year-old man, Suleyman Kir, described struggling with the animal after it pounced on him while he was sleeping outdoors. The lion, named Zeus, was later located by police and shot dead. The incident has raised questions about the security measures at the Land of Lions park, which claims to house the world's largest lion family, though the zoo has not commented on how the escape occurred.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have struck central Texas, leading to the deaths of at least 50 people and a large-scale search for the missing, including 27 girls from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and sweeping away homes and vehicles with little warning. Questions are now being raised about the adequacy of the forecasting and alert systems, as local officials stated they did not anticipate the severity of the downpour. Rescue operations are continuing across multiple counties as authorities grapple with one of the worst flooding disasters in the region's history.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has finalized the signing of Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee approaching £60 million. The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder has signed a five-year contract, becoming the Gunners' second major summer acquisition. The deal was reportedly a long-term project for manager Mikel Arteta, with Arsenal having laid the groundwork for the transfer a year in advance to fend off interest from other clubs, including Liverpool. The article details the complex negotiations, which involved structuring the payment to avoid a lump-sum release clause, highlighting the strategic planning behind the high-profile move.</p>

          <p>Actress Jenilee Harrison, known for replacing Suzanne Somers on the sitcom "Three's Company," has revealed that she insisted on remaining clothed for her 1987 Playboy photoshoot. In a recent interview, Harrison explained that her contract stipulated she would not be nude, a demand that initially shocked the photographer and required a complete production halt to bring in wardrobe. She reflected on her discomfort with being a sex symbol, viewing it as a professional role rather than her true identity. Harrison is now co-hosting a podcast, "Stall Talk," where she shares stories and wisdom from her life and career experiences.</p>

          <p>The surprising victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary is being hailed as a major success for ranked-choice voting (RCV). Starting with just 1% in early polls, Mamdani's campaign was able to build momentum without being pushed out of the race, a common fate for long-shot candidates under traditional plurality systems. RCV encouraged a more positive, coalition-building campaign style, with candidates cross-endorsing each other and focusing on issues rather than attacks. The system's success is reflected in high voter satisfaction and historic turnout, suggesting it offers a potential model for reducing polarization in elections.</p>

          <p>Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer has emerged as a surprisingly powerful, albeit unofficial, adviser on national security within Donald Trump's second administration. Despite having no formal government role, Loomer has had direct access to the president, successfully pushing for the removal of several National Security Council staffers she deemed disloyal. Her influence has caused alarm among national security professionals and even some Republican senators, who are concerned about the ousting of experienced officials. Loomer has also been a vocal supporter of Trump's recent decision to bomb Iran, using it as a litmus test for loyalty within the MAGA movement.</p>

This article features commentary from Ted Johnson, a retired US Navy commander, who discusses the flag's complicated history, representing both ideals worth dying for and a system of oppression. The piece examines the motivations of Black service members throughout history and the modern reclamation of patriotic imagery by figures like Beyoncé. It posits that this reclamation is a powerful statement of ownership and belonging, asserting that America is home despite its history of racial injustice.</p>

          <p>A federal advisory committee to the CDC has recommended that flu shots be made without thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. The ingredient has been a target of vaccine safety critics for years, despite scientific consensus that it is safe and its link to autism has been thoroughly debunked. The move by the newly appointed Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has been criticized by some health experts, who note that 94% of flu shots are already thimerosal-free and that the decision addresses a non-existent problem. Critics worry this could undermine public confidence in vaccines by giving credence to disproven theories.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Mark Rowley, has called for a major overhaul of policing in England and Wales, suggesting the 43 existing forces be consolidated into 12-15 larger, regional 'mega' forces. Rowley argues the current model is not fit for purpose, with smaller forces being inefficient and unable to keep pace with modern crime. The proposal comes as UK police face challenges from years of austerity, underfunding, and declining public trust following high-profile scandals, such as the case of Sarah Everard who was sexually assaulted and murdered by a serving officer. Rowley believes larger forces would make better use of limited funds and improve specialization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the Labour government's recent reversal on planned welfare reforms has made future spending decisions, including the potential removal of the two-child benefit cap, more difficult. The government was forced to water down a package of reforms that would have saved £5 billion annually, putting pressure on the upcoming budget. While a child poverty taskforce is considering scrapping the cap, which affects 1.6 million children, the Chancellor has indicated she is not committed to any specific policy. Phillipson emphasized that while the cap is an important issue, the government is also focused on other support mechanisms like family hubs and free school meals.</p>

The policy expands on a previous Conservative initiative that established 400 hubs in 75 local authorities.

          <p>Israel will send a delegation to Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas regarding a new ceasefire and hostage release proposal, despite finding Hamas's requested amendments to be unacceptable. The plan, presented by mediators, is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire, the release of remaining Israeli hostages, and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. A key sticking point is Hamas's demand for a guaranteed end to hostilities, a condition Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected, vowing to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed. The decision to proceed with talks keeps diplomatic channels open amid intense international pressure.</p>

Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries like Myanmar and Cuba that reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had blocked the removal, which had required that migrants be given a chance to speak with an asylum officer before being sent to a third country. This action is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand its authority to deport non-citizens to countries other than their own.</p>

          <p>Tanzania maintains a uniquely deep military relationship with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) that is unparalleled elsewhere in Africa, according to a recent study. The report from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies notes that Tanzania's military doctrine, inventory, and structure are heavily influenced by the PLA. This special connection is rooted in a history of close ties between China and African nations where liberation movement parties, like the one in Tanzania, have held power since gaining independence. The analysis places Tanzania alongside countries like Mozambique and Zimbabwe as having the closest security partnerships with Beijing on the continent.</p>

          <p>The effective shutdown of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program credited with saving 26 million lives, has been met with conspicuous silence from the U.S. evangelical community that once championed it. This article explores the complex reasons for this shift, from a lack of awareness and compassion fatigue to an aversion to political conflict and fealty to the Trump administration. Some pastors cite a distrust of government programs, while others point to a lingering view of HIV/AIDS as a consequence of sin. The silence marks a stark contrast to the community's vocal activism on other cultural issues, raising questions about its modern priorities.</p>

One famous example is the 'Canadian Caper,' dramatized in the film "Argo," where CIA operatives used the cover of a film crew to rescue diplomats from Iran.

          <p>California's energy policies are facing criticism for driving up gasoline prices and dismantling the state's oil refining capacity, leading to a greater reliance on foreign fuel imports. With two more major refineries scheduled to close, the state's production capacity will be significantly reduced, forcing it to import more fuel from overseas, often from places with lower environmental standards. This not only increases global pollution but also poses a national security risk, as military bases in the region depend on local refineries. Critics argue these policies disproportionately harm working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles and are burdened by the nation's highest gas prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for a stretch of the coastline including Myrtle Beach, with forecasts of 2 to 4 inches of rain and localized flash flooding. Flood watches have been issued for parts of both North and South Carolina as the system continues to move north.</p>

          <p>Two months after being ousted from Germany's ruling coalition, the Green Party is struggling to redefine its role and strategy in opposition. Party leaders have put forward a paper aimed at restructuring their approach, acknowledging that their public image suffered from policies perceived as overly prescriptive, like the controversial heating law. The party now aims to listen more to voters' everyday concerns, but faces challenges with limited personnel, especially in eastern Germany. As the new government pursues policies the Greens largely support, such as aid to Ukraine, the party is finding it difficult to carve out a distinct and popular opposition platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Peking University have developed a new data sorting method that is faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a key bottleneck in computing. The system uses memristors, an electronic component that combines processing and memory functions, to perform 'sort-in-memory' operations. This approach avoids the data transfer delays inherent in traditional computer architecture, where memory and processing units are separate. The team built a hardware prototype that demonstrated significant speed and efficiency gains in tasks like AI neural network inference, offering a promising solution for high-performance computing applications.</p>

          <p>A California family who voted for Donald Trump, partly due to his promises of mass deportations, says they feel betrayed after the mother, a Canadian national, was detained by ICE. Cynthia Olivera, who has lived in the U.S. without legal status since she was 10, was taken into custody during an interview for permanent residency and is now awaiting deportation. Her husband, a U.S. citizen and Trump voter, expressed shock, stating they supported deporting criminals and never believed his wife would be targeted. The case highlights the broad scope of the administration's immigration crackdown, which affects many without criminal records.</p>

          <p>A new report from the German parliament reveals that over 1.4 million pensioners in the country are still working after reaching retirement age. Of this group, nearly 375,000 hold jobs that are more substantial than minor side employment, indicating a growing trend of older individuals remaining in the workforce. Dietmar Bartsch of the Left Party, who requested the data, criticized the situation, attributing it to Germany's comparatively low pension level relative to the EU average. He argued that many continue to work out of financial necessity rather than choice and called for major pension reforms.</p>

          <p>A report from the research services of the German parliament has raised significant doubts about the international legal justification for recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran. The analysis, requested by a Left Party lawmaker, concludes that most legal experts believe the criteria for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter were not met. The report argues that Israel would have needed to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack, not just that Iran possessed sufficient nuclear material. This assessment contrasts with the German government's official stance, which has been vocally supportive of the military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>According to a French intelligence assessment, China has been actively working to undermine sales of France's flagship Rafale fighter jet. The report claims that Chinese embassy defense attaches have been lobbying countries, particularly in Asia, to discourage them from purchasing the French aircraft, instead promoting Chinese-made alternatives. This campaign allegedly intensified after recent air combat between India and Pakistan, where both sides used French and Chinese hardware. French officials believe this is part of a broader disinformation effort by Beijing to damage the Rafale's reputation, weaken France's strategic partnerships, and bolster its own position as a dominant regional power.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with some participants in a clinical trial regaining significant hearing after a single injection. The therapy targets a genetic mutation in the OTOF gene, which prevents the transmission of sound signals from the ear to the brain. Researchers used a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene into the inner ear of 10 participants, including children and adults. The treatment was found to be safe and effective, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing, offering hope for treating other forms of genetic hearing loss.</p>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, England, who personally apprehended a man stealing a crate of beer, has criticized the lack of legal consequences for the offender. The thief was dealt with through a 'community resolution' after admitting to the offense, which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, argues this approach fails as a deterrent and sends the wrong signal to criminals, reflecting a national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses go unpunished.

In the decade from 2012 to 2022, the number of convents in Germany fell from over 1,600 to under 1,000, with female orders seeing the most dramatic decline. This trend is attributed to societal secularization and increased professional opportunities for women, which were once primarily found within religious orders.
