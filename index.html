          <p>As Japan's population ages, an increasing number of elderly individuals without children are choosing to donate their assets to charitable organizations after their death. This trend is fueled by the rise in childless couples and unmarried individuals who lack direct heirs. Bequest donations are facilitated by organizations like Readyfor Inc., which connect donors with recipients, such as medical facilities and universities. Yoko Inaba, a 71-year-old, has arranged for her money to be donated to a medical facility for newborns, driven by a personal connection to infant medical treatment. This shift reflects a growing awareness of bequest donations among those without heirs, leading to a rise in planned giving to support various causes.</p>

Many clients are lamenting the end of reliable returns from bank deposits, according to a client manager at China Merchants Bank.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister after a controversial remark about gifted rice sparked public anger amid rising rice prices. The agriculture minister, Taku Eto, joked about having so much gifted rice that he could sell it, a comment deemed insensitive given public concerns over inflation. Ishiba's decision to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi, a young leadership hopeful, is seen as a gamble to limit damage ahead of a looming parliamentary election. The opposition has seized on the issue, threatening a no-confidence motion and pressuring Ishiba to address rising rice prices.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, the highest in over two years, driven by reduced energy subsidies and rising rice prices.

Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. Rising rice prices have contributed significantly to the increase, with the Prime Minister pledging to lower prices.

          <p>The Greater Washington area is in mourning after two Israeli Embassy employees were shot and killed, an act described by the F.B.I. director as 'targeted anti-Semitic violence'. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were leaving a museum after an event for young diplomats. Community leaders expressed shock and grief, highlighting the rise in antisemitism. Vigils were held to honor the couple, with calls for increased government funding for security at Jewish organizations. The shooting has left the community shaken and grappling with the loss.</p>

          <p>An Ohio bill proposes banning non-citizens from 'foreign adversary' countries, including China, from owning land near critical infrastructure, potentially forcing Chinese residents to sell their homes. The legislation mirrors similar measures in Florida and Texas, aiming to address national security concerns. Xiang Zhang, a professor at the University of Cincinnati, testified against the bill, arguing it would unfairly target him and others based solely on nationality, even with legal residency status. The proposed law has raised concerns about discrimination and its impact on the lives of affected residents.</p>

          <p>North Korea has initiated an investigation into the failed launch of its second naval destroyer, following leader Kim Jong Un's expression of anger over the incident, which he attributed to criminal negligence. The 5,000-ton-class warship sustained damage when a transport cradle detached prematurely during a launch ceremony. Despite claiming the damage is not serious and can be repaired in about 10 days, external observers remain skeptical. The incident is seen as a setback for North Korea's naval modernization efforts, with Kim ordering repairs before a high-level meeting.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a detained Palestinian activist, was allowed to hold his one-month-old son for the first time after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's efforts to keep them separated.

The government initially opposed a 'contact visit,' citing security concerns. Supporters argue Khalil's detention is political retaliation, while his lawyers presented testimony about the risks he would face if deported.</p>
