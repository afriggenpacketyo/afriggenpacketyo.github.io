        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yudai Matsuzaki's vision to create craft gin in Japan stemmed from a desire to utilize a local forest, leading him to plant conifers for juniper berries. He is among a growing number of small-scale distillers in Japan who are using homegrown ingredients to produce craft gins, resulting in a domestic gin boom. Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly since 2019, with major manufacturers like Suntory and Asahi entering the market with sugar-free canned gin products. The fact that distillation equipment for whiskey and shochu can be converted to produce gin, which does not typically require aging, has been a boon to the industry.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand and mitigate the increasing noise pollution affecting communities near launch sites. With the growing frequency of launches, especially SpaceX's Falcon 9, the sonic booms generated by returning rocket boosters are causing disturbances such as shaking windows and waking residents. Kent Gee at Brigham Young University is leading research to analyze the unique three-part sonic boom produced by Falcon 9 boosters, aiming to develop strategies for reducing noise disruptions before the problem becomes widespread with the advent of larger rockets like Starship. The best time to address rocket noise is before problems become pervasive and entrenched.</p>

          <p>A sixth inmate, Lenton Vanburen, who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier in May has been captured in Baton Rouge. Vanburen was serving time for parole violation, possession of a firearm by a felon, and illegal carrying of a weapon, and will now face additional charges related to the escape. Ten inmates escaped on May 16 after forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, with the escape going unnoticed for over eight hours. Authorities have arrested at least nine people in connection with the escape, including a maintenance worker accused of disabling water to a cell used in the jailbreak.</p>

          <p>Senators Ted Cruz and Ben Ray Lujan have introduced a bipartisan bill aimed at streamlining the presidential permitting process for international bridges and land ports of entry along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada.

The goal is to boost economic activity in border communities by facilitating trade, business, and tourism.

The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus.

The findings indicate a potential "Trump slump" affecting the U.S. tourism industry, with preliminary figures showing a decrease in overseas visits.
