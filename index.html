          <p>Robinhood has finalized its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, a long-standing cryptocurrency exchange, marking a strategic shift beyond retail trading into institutional services. The all-cash deal provides Robinhood with an immediate international presence, including over 50 active crypto licenses across Europe, the UK, and Asia, as well as an established institutional client base. This move allows Robinhood to offer institutional crypto flows, lending and staking infrastructure, and white-label "crypto-as-a-service" products, catering to hedge funds, fintechs, and registered investment advisors, and Robinhood aims to rebrand itself as a serious player in the evolving digital asset finance landscape. The company intends to combine its retail strengths with Bitstamp's institutional offerings for a more comprehensive service.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder.

He allegedly told police he wanted to kill all Zionist people and had been planning the attack for a year, and the victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were hospitalized with burns, some in critical condition. The attack targeted a Run for Their Lives walk, aimed at raising awareness about hostages held by Hamas, and authorities recovered unlit Molotov cocktails at the scene.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The odds of credit card interest rates declining this June are low due to the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate cuts and persistent economic uncertainty. Credit card rates are influenced by factors beyond the Federal Reserve, including the prime rate, and rates climbed even amid Fed rate cuts in late 2024. Economic uncertainty, marked by fluctuating inflation and stock market volatility, further discourages credit card companies from reducing rates. Consumers are advised to explore debt relief options such as credit card debt forgiveness, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

While Title I funding remains unchanged, the budget proposes consolidating and cutting funding for various K-12 programs and increasing special education funding, although the increase is offset by consolidating separate programs.

Former staffers reported that Fetterman spends hours alone in his office and avoids colleagues and meetings, and Fetterman responded to the criticism by dismissing it as a smear.

          <p>Elon Musk's brain tech startup, Neuralink, has secured $650 million in a new funding round, with participation from firms like ARK Invest, Founders Fund, and Sequoia Capital. The funding will support the company's efforts to bring its brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to more patients and develop new devices that enhance the connection between biological and artificial intelligence. Neuralink's first system, Telepathy, involves inserting 64 threads into the brain to record neural signals, and the initial aim is to help patients with severe paralysis regain independence. Currently, five patients have been implanted with Neuralink's technology and can control digital devices with their thoughts.</p>
