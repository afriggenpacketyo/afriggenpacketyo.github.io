        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin, are experiencing a second consecutive day of significant travel disruption following a cyberattack. The chaos stems from an attack that disabled the 'Muse' check-in and baggage software provided by Collins Aerospace, impacting multiple airlines. With the system still offline, airports are resorting to manual check-in processes, leading to long queues, hundreds of delays, and numerous flight cancellations. Officials have not yet provided a timeline for when the critical airline software will be fully functional again.</p>

          <p>In a Fox News opinion piece, William Bennett reflects on the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, suggesting it signifies a dangerous shift in the American political landscape. The author argues that society has lost the ability to engage in reasoned debate, replacing persuasion with passionate intensity and hostility. Bennett laments that the high personal cost of public conviction is causing principled individuals to retreat from political engagement. This trend, he concludes, threatens the very foundation of democratic argument and civil discourse in the nation.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Manila and other cities across the Philippines to voice their anger over a massive corruption scandal involving flood control projects. The demonstrations were sparked by revelations that billions of dollars allocated for infrastructure were either misused on substandard projects or embezzled entirely. This public outrage follows deadly monsoons that recently devastated parts of the country, amplifying calls for accountability from government officials. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has acknowledged the scandal and urged protesters to remain peaceful.</p>

          <p>Charities and universities in the United Kingdom are criticizing the government's immigration rules that prevent scholarship students from Gaza from bringing their families with them. While 34 students were recently evacuated to begin their studies, some are considering giving up their places rather than leaving their dependents behind in a conflict zone. Critics have labeled the policy "excessively harsh," forcing students to make an impossible choice between their education and their families' safety. The government's stricter rules on dependents for most international students are part of a broader crackdown on immigration.</p>

The beneficiaries are the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration, in memory of her late husband; Shalom Farms, which addresses food insecurity; and the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, which supports military families.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's continued attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence and his demands for aggressive interest rate cuts pose a significant threat to the U.S. economy. The author contends that politicizing the central bank could lead to short-term gains but ultimately result in dangerously high inflation, rattling financial markets and increasing borrowing costs for consumers and the government. Citing historical examples from the U.S. and other countries like Turkey, the article warns that undermining the Fed's credibility could have severe and long-lasting negative consequences.

          <p>The rapid expansion of co-living housing developments across New York City is fueling concerns about gentrification and the displacement of long-term residents. These dorm-style complexes, which offer small private rooms with shared amenities at premium prices, are attracting young, transient professionals to historically working-class neighborhoods like Crown Heights and Bushwick. While companies promote a built-in community for newcomers, local community members and activists argue that these developments cater to a temporary population, drive up local rents, and contribute to the erosion of neighborhood character and cultural history.</p>

Key determinants will likely include President Trump's approval rating, the state of the economy, and voter enthusiasm. Ultimately, the article concludes, the outcome will rest more in the hands of the electorate than with politicians redrawing maps.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The message was reportedly sent just weeks after she had publicly condemned her association with him as a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the Duchess claims the email was sent to appease Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation for linking him to pedophilia. The revelation adds another layer to the ongoing scrutiny of the relationships maintained by public figures with the disgraced financier.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Calls for Empathy Amid Rising Political Hate and Violence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 05:00:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece for The Guardian, author Keith Magee argues that societies in both the U.S. and Britain are normalizing hate, leading to a dangerous deficit of empathy. Using personal experiences with racism and the broader context of political violence, including the murder of Charlie Kirk, the author reflects on the societal cost of division. The article draws on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks to advocate for a radical love that transcends political grievance. It concludes that empathy is not a weakness but a moral courage necessary to heal divided nations.</p>

          <p>Voters in Guinea are participating in a constitutional referendum that could permit the country's military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, to run for president. Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, has overseen the drafting of a new constitution that also extends presidential terms and makes it harder for political parties to compete. With the main opposition leaders calling for a boycott and a general crackdown on dissent, the "yes" vote is widely expected to pass.

          <p>Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of Charlie Kirk's podcast, has claimed on social media that it was a "miracle" more people were not injured by the bullet that killed the right-wing activist. Citing a conversation with a surgeon who operated on Kirk, Kolvet suggested the bullet did not exit his body because his bone density was impressively high. The surgeon was quoted as saying the high-velocity round should have passed through and likely would have killed people standing behind him. This narrative is emerging as thousands prepare for Kirk's memorial service in Arizona.</p>
