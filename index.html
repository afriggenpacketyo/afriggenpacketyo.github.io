          <p>A Conservative MP, George Freeman, has self-referred to the parliamentary standards commissioner following allegations he allowed a company he worked for to help write parliamentary questions. The Sunday Times reported that Freeman, a former science minister, sought input from environmental monitoring firm GHGSat for questions related to its sector, despite being advised not to lobby the government on its behalf. Freeman denies wrongdoing, stating he regularly consults experts for technical clarity, but opposition parties are calling for his suspension pending the investigation.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, author and activist V reflects on navigating the current political climate, which she describes as suffocating and perilous. She argues for embracing dualityâ€”feeling pain without succumbing to despair and channeling rage into purposeful actionâ€”as a key survival strategy against rising authoritarianism. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Democratic Republic of Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, she emphasizes the power of community care and collective action. V concludes that maintaining one's humanity is a form of resistance and that every small act of love and solidarity helps build a new world.</p>

          <p>A Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb has fired a music teacher of 21 years, Mark Richards, after a parent discovered he was married to a man from his late husband's obituary. The dismissal was based on a morality clause in his contract prohibiting same-sex marriage, which Richards said had previously been overlooked. The incident has sparked outrage in the community, with a petition supporting Richards gaining over 1,500 signatures and parents calling for the archdiocese to change the discriminatory policy. The archdiocese, currently navigating bankruptcy from clergy sexual assault scandals, has stated the decision is final.</p>

          <p>The absence of a confirmed or acting director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has effectively placed HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in direct control of the agency. Legal experts note this gives Kennedy, known for his anti-vaccine activism, the authority to sign off on crucial public health recommendations, a power he has already used to alter vaccine guidance. This situation, created by a new law requiring Senate confirmation for the CDC director, has led to confusion and concern among health professionals about the politicization of scientific decisions.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Far From Home," Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska offers a candid look at her political career, marked by her moderate stance and frequent conflicts with Donald Trump. She recounts voting to convict Trump in his second impeachment and his subsequent failed attempt to oust her from office. Murkowski also expresses deep dismay with the Supreme Court, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for overturning Roe v. Wade, a decision she feels was made in bad faith based on his confirmation testimony. The book highlights her isolation as one of the few remaining centrist Republicans in an increasingly partisan Washington.</p>

          <p>The lone star tick, which can cause a severe red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome, is rapidly expanding its territory across the eastern U.S. due to the climate crisis. Experts warn that the population of these aggressive ticks is exploding, potentially putting millions at risk for the allergy, which has already affected up to 450,000 Americans. The ticks are spreading from their traditional southeastern habitat to northern and western regions, aided by rising temperatures and increased human-wildlife interaction. This expansion is part of a broader trend of increasing tick-borne illness threats across a warming United States.</p>

          <p>A group of over 59,000 federal workers fired since Donald Trump took office have been regularly visiting Capitol Hill to plead their case to lawmakers, often facing indifference and rejection. Dubbed the "Tuesday Group," these former government employees seek to highlight the personal impact of the workforce reduction campaign, but have received a cold reception from many Republican offices. Despite being ignored or belittled, the group persists, viewing their presence as a way to make their struggle visible and hold officials accountable.

          <p>A trend among younger bar patrons to pay for each drink as it's ordered, rather than opening a tab, is reportedly causing frustration for bartenders. While some bartenders find the practice "unequivocally annoying" as it slows down service during busy periods, they also acknowledge its potential benefits for customers. Paying drink-by-drink can help individuals better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, reflecting a more fiscally responsible approach. The habit may also be influenced by a decline in overall alcohol consumption among young adults and concerns about leaving credit cards with the bar.</p>

He emphasized that Iran still possesses the necessary industrial and technological capabilities.

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from President Trump and his top aides have created confusion about the mission's success. While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran was only a matter of months. As the week progressed, officials seemed to shift the goalposts, emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing on the complete destruction of nuclear capabilities.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California's public and cultural identity has been shaped by a narrative that systematically erases the history and presence of its Indigenous peoples. The author notes how visitor guides, local establishments, and even academic institutions often skip from a brief mention of pre-colonial tribes directly to Spanish colonization, ignoring millennia of history and the violent realities of the 19th century. This sanitized version of the past, promoted by early 20th-century scholars, reimagined massacres as progress and perpetuated the myth of the "vanishing Indian."

          <p>Two individuals were injured after a car crashed and overturned in London's Piccadilly Circus early Sunday morning. Emergency services were called to the scene near the iconic Eros statue around 5:30 BST. The London Ambulance Service reported treating two people, taking one to a major trauma center and the other to a local hospital. Images from the scene show a heavily damaged vehicle on its roof, and police have cordoned off the area, a major tourist hub and one of the capital's busiest intersections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities exemplifies what can be described as President Trump's "One-and-Done Doctrine" for military action. This approach favors discrete, high-impact strikes over sustained campaigns, reflecting Trump's aversion to "endless wars" and his confidence in decisive, short-term operations. While he has authorized significant military actions like the Soleimani strike and the recent Iran bombing, he avoids long-term entanglements. This strategy, however, faces questions about its long-term effectiveness, as it's unclear if a single attack will be sufficient to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions permanently.</p>

          <p>The recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran were met with a surprisingly cautious and muted response from Tehran's supposed allies, China and Russia. Instead of rushing to Iran's defense, Beijing emphasized diplomacy and warned against disrupting global trade, revealing the practical limits of their anti-American axis. The article argues that while the three nations share an antagonism toward the West, their strategic and economic interests diverge significantly, especially when global stability is at risk. This lack of unconditional support for Iran suggests that China prioritizes its own economic relations with the West over backing its partners in a direct confrontation.</p>

          <p>The slang term "crashing out" has become popular on social media, particularly among Gen Z, to describe a wide range of emotional outbursts, from anger and stress to mental health struggles. The phrase, popularized in part by rapper NBA YoungBoy, is used to label the unfiltered behavior of public figures like Justin Bieber and reality star Huda Mustafa, as well as in personal TikTok videos. While some see "crashing out" as a necessary form of catharsis for a burnt-out generation, mental health professionals express concern. They worry the trend may glorify emotional dysregulation and discourage the development of healthier coping mechanisms.</p>

          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts reflect on the lessons it offers for modern seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a uniform Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, reshaping the city's identity. However, experts note that many vulnerabilities, such as soft-story apartment buildings and unbolted single-family homes, still persist in Santa Barbara and across the state, highlighting ongoing challenges in seismic safety.</p>
