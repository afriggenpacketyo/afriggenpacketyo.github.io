        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Quinnipiac University poll reveals that 53% of Democrats disapprove of how their party's lawmakers are handling their jobs in Congress. Only 41% of Democrats approve of their performance, and among all voters, a mere 21% approve of the Democrats' congressional work. The poll, conducted between June 5-8, shows that 79% of GOP voters approve of congressional Republicans. Since President Donald Trump's return to power, an energized Democratic base has been pushing party leaders to strongly oppose his agenda, which has fueled a decline in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, based on claims that he is a threat to U.S. foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, chilling his speech, which constitutes irreparable harm. Khalil has been detained in Louisiana since March, missing the birth of his first child. The ruling does not affect the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to remove Khalil based on alleged inaccuracies in his green card application.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced eight new advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous roster of 17. Kennedy's picks include individuals with a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety, circumventing the usual CDC vetting process. Among the appointees are Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who criticized COVID-19 restrictions. The panel's recommendations are influential as they are directly tied to federal policies regarding vaccine coverage.</p>

          <p>Businesses in the Civic Center area and Little Tokyo are facing challenges due to ongoing protests, clashes with police, and vandalism, with many supporting the protests but noting the negative impact on business. A boba shop owner reported a significant drop in sales due to reduced foot traffic and the imposed curfew, which requires earlier closing times. A sales associate at a knick-knack shop mentioned that the store's exterior was vandalized with graffiti, and they've been closing earlier due to the demonstrations. Residents have mixed feelings, with some understanding the protesters' cause and others concerned about the curfew's potential impact on events and safety.</p>

The executives coerced employees into working long hours with little to no pay and intimidated them into financial ruin to pay for expensive OneTaste courses and retreats.

The 700 Marines are reportedly at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach for civil disturbance training, with local and state officials not requesting their assistance.
