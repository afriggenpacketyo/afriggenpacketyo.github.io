          <p>Ford announced a $2 billion investment in its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new line of affordable electric vehicles. The plan, which includes a new $30,000 electric pickup truck slated for 2027, aims to compete with Chinese manufacturers and represents a significant strategic shift for the American automaker. This investment is part of Ford's "Universal EV Program" and will utilize new U.S.-assembled LFP batteries, though the plant's retooling will result in a net reduction of about 600 jobs. The move comes as Ford navigates changing EV policies and increased global competition.</p>

Fortunately, no one on the ground was harmed, and no homes were damaged in the incident.

          <p>A significant fire that spread across the gorse and heather of Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh was almost certainly caused by human activity, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. While the exact cause is unknown and a deliberate act has not been ruled out, officials noted that natural wildfires are rare in Scotland. The blaze, which led to the evacuation of the area but caused no casualties, has prompted road closures and highlighted the growing risk of wildfires amid a warm, dry summer and changes in land use. Experts suggest climate change is contributing to more frequent and larger fires.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placed the city's police under federal control. The administration cited a need to address what it called "violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals," a claim that contradicts official police statistics showing a significant decrease in violent crime in the city. Washington's mayor, Muriel Bowser, criticized the move as an inefficient use of the Guard and disputed the administration's portrayal of crime levels in the capital. The deployment follows a similar controversial action in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted, securing their access to the lucrative Chinese market. While analysts view the move as a net positive for the companies, it sets a strange precedent and raises questions about future U.S. tech policy and China's reaction. The agreement underscores the Trump administration's transactional approach to managing strategic technology exports. (not investment advice)</p>

This move represents a significant escalation in the political battle over gerrymandering, as Democrats seek to counteract potential Republican gains in the House of Representatives.

          <p>Cannabis stocks rallied significantly following reports that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule under federal law. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III could provide major benefits to the industry, including tax relief and increased access to institutional investment. Trump confirmed he is looking at the issue and will make a determination soon, fueling optimism in the sector. While the final decision rests with the Attorney General, the president's support is seen as a potential game-changer for the cannabis market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC events will be available on the Paramount+ streaming service, eliminating the pay-per-view model for U.S. fans. The deal, which averages $1.1 billion per year, is a significant strategic acquisition for Paramount's new leadership, securing a year-round, high-demand sports property to drive streaming subscriptions. TKO Group, UFC's parent company, views the move as a modernization of its distribution model.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will officially shut down its dial-up internet service on September 30, marking the end of an era for millions of Americans. The iconic sound of a modem connecting was the soundtrack to the early internet for a generation, as AOL became the dominant service provider in the late 1990s with over 23 million subscribers. The service has since been rendered largely obsolete by faster broadband and fiber optic connections, with only a small fraction of households still relying on it. The discontinuation marks a final farewell to a foundational piece of internet history.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that men who commit serious sexual assault against women "probably" forfeit their right to choose their gender. Her comments come as she reflects on the intense debate surrounding Scotland's gender recognition laws, which she now admits she should have paused. The controversy was fueled by the case of Isla Bryson, a transgender offender convicted of sexual assault, who was initially sent to a women's prison. Sturgeon acknowledged she should have been more "straightforward" at the time and that the debate had lost all "sense of rationality," accepting partial responsibility.</p>

          <p>A severe funding shortfall is crippling the federal program that pays private attorneys to represent defendants who cannot afford their own counsel. The fund, established by the Criminal Justice Act, ran out of money in July, meaning thousands of court-appointed lawyers and their support staff across the country are not being compensated for their work. This financial crisis threatens to create attorney shortages, delay trials, and undermine the constitutional right to counsel for indigent defendants. Legal experts and federal judges are warning that without immediate congressional action, the justice system could face significant backlogs and potential case dismissals.</p>

          <p>Dame Stephanie Shirley, a trailblazing figure in the technology industry and a dedicated philanthropist, has passed away at the age of 91.

Adopting the name "Steve" to navigate the male-dominated business world, she built a successful company and later donated most of her £150 million fortune to charitable causes, particularly those supporting autism research and IT projects.

          <p>With interest rates still relatively high, savers are weighing the benefits of certificates of deposit (CDs) against high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Experts advise that HYSAs are best for those who need liquidity and may require access to their funds for emergencies, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who want to lock in the current high rates for a set term, as they typically offer a slightly better return and protect against future rate drops. For those with larger sums, a strategy of splitting funds between both or using a CD ladder can offer a balance of growth and accessibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals that medication abortions significantly contributed to a rise in the total number of abortions in the U.S. following the repeal of Roe v. Wade. Between mid-2023 and mid-2024, one provider shipped nearly 120,000 abortion pill packs, with the majority going to residents in states with abortion bans. The research found that provision rates were higher in poorer counties and in states that outlaw abortion, highlighting the role of telehealth services and "shield laws" in maintaining access. This data provides the first county-level look at how abortion access has shifted in a post-Roe landscape.</p>

While the government is proposing changes like compulsory eye tests for older drivers, it has no current plans to introduce limits for new drivers, such as restricting peer-age passengers. The Justice Minister cited concerns about unfairly discriminating against young people, but road safety charities and the AA argue such measures are crucial for saving lives, as young drivers are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions. The government stated it is considering other measures to protect young drivers in its upcoming road safety strategy.</p>
