          <h2>OPEC+ Agrees to Increase Oil Production, Causing U.S. Crude Prices to Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 14:55:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline of approximately 2% following OPEC+'s agreement to boost production for the second consecutive month, raising concerns about potential oversupply. The decision to increase output by 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' forecast, has intensified fears of a recession driven by U.S. tariffs. This situation is expected to negatively impact investment in exploration and production, with oil majors like Chevron and Exxon reporting lower first-quarter earnings due to weaker oil prices, creating uncertainty in the market. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted a second round of layoffs, affecting hundreds of employees, including around 50 from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). These cuts, which were unexpected by NIH officials, have impacted programs such as the Cancer Information Service, which provides crucial information to doctors and patients. The layoffs occurred shortly after discussions about consolidating communications offices across the agency, raising concerns about the future of public liaison and information dissemination efforts. Some believe the cuts were to reinstate other scientists to comply with layoff targets.</p>

          <p>Christopher Walrath, a former corrections officer, pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in connection with the beating death of Robert Brooks, a prisoner at Marcy Correctional Facility. Walrath admitted to improperly leaving his post and participating in the assault, which involved prohibited acts such as beating Brooks in the groin and placing him in a chokehold. The attack, recorded by body-worn cameras, has led to the suspension or resignation of multiple prison employees. The district attorney described the incident as a "welcome to Marcy" initiation, highlighting systemic issues within the prison. The footage showed officers kicking and punching a shackled Mr. Brooks in the groin and chest, choking him, and pinning him onto an infirmary examination table while they punched him.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reduced its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after an "emergency message" to employees, following concerns that the initial policy caused financial hardship for beneficiaries. The prior policy change, directed by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, aimed to recover erroneous overpayments more aggressively, but led to some recipients being unable to afford basic necessities. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, advocates argue that taking half of the monthly benefit will still burden many disabled workers relying on SSDI, especially since a fifth of all SSDI beneficiaries rely on their benefits for almost all of their income.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the European Central Bank indicates that European consumers are increasingly avoiding U.S. products and services due to President Trump's trade war, imposing tariffs and threatening reciprocal tariffs on the European Union. This shift is evident in the rise of grass-roots boycotts and the development of apps that help consumers identify and avoid American-made goods. Even households that can afford higher prices are consciously choosing alternatives, suggesting a potential long-term structural change in consumer preferences. Companies like Tesla and McDonald's are observing growing negative attitudes abroad toward U.S. brands, particularly in Northern Europe and Canada.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has launched a new round of airstrikes in Yemen after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile that landed near Israel's main airport. The Houthis have vowed to continue attacks on Israeli airports and implement a comprehensive aerial blockade on Israel. Since March 15, U.S. Central Command has been conducting an intense campaign targeting the Houthi organization in Yemen to restore freedom of navigation and American deterrence. The Houthis have been firing at Israel since the war against Hamas in Gaza began, and the Houthis have been raising their profile as the last member of Iran's self-described "Axis of Resistance" capable of launching regular attacks on Israel.</p>

Fractional gold offers a lower entry price point for investors while still getting invested in bullion.

          <p>After a remarkable victory over Lyon in the Women's Champions League, Arsenal suffered unexpected defeats to Aston Villa and Brighton in the WSL. Caitlin Foord emphasized the need for self-reflection and improvement, citing unacceptable defensive lapses. Arsenal conceded nine goals in their past two WSL games after conceding 14 in their previous 19 outings. The manager said that the team needs to learn two very tough lessons coming off a big success, and that they have to find solutions and move forward.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to assess the feasibility of reopening Alcatraz as a substantially enlarged and rebuilt prison. The Bureau of Prisons director stated the agency will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda. Alcatraz, which has been closed since 1963 and is now a national park, was once home to notorious prisoners like Al Capone. The proposal has been met with skepticism, with concerns raised about the cost of restoring the facility and the high cost of living in San Francisco.</p>
