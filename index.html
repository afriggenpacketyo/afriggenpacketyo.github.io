          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion. This move is notable given the insurer's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook, which align with Buffett's history of value investing. The investment, potentially made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, caused UnitedHealth's stock to rise significantly in after-hours trading. The filing also showed Berkshire trimmed its positions in Apple and Bank of America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he believes both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are willing to make peace, ahead of his summit with Putin in Alaska. The meeting is viewed by some observers as a strategic opportunity for Putin to influence U.S. policy and ease pressure from potential sanctions. Trump has managed expectations for the direct meeting, suggesting a subsequent meeting involving himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy would be more significant for brokering an end to the war. The summit is being closely watched to see if it can produce any tangible steps toward a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Palantir has experienced a remarkable surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation surpassing $430 billion. This growth is largely fueled by significant government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, and increasing interest from retail investors. Despite its high valuation, Palantir's revenue is a fraction of that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, leading to a very high forward price-to-earnings ratio. This indicates that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

Her absence comes shortly after President Trump federalized the city's police department, deploying National Guard troops and federal agents to address rising crime lethality. While overall crime has trended down since 2020, the severity and deadliness of violent crimes have increased significantly. Bowser has publicly criticized the federal intervention as an intrusion on the city's autonomy and an authoritarian push by the president.</p>

The company stated that individuals requiring the medication typically receive it directly from their medical providers rather than seeking it at a retail pharmacy. This decision was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative anti-abortion advocacy group. The move places Costco among the retailers navigating the politically charged landscape of reproductive healthcare access following changes in federal regulations.</p>

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a public health emergency, experts warn the global response has been dangerously insufficient. The virus has spread rapidly across Africa, with outbreaks in 24 countries, driven by a new, more transmissible strain. Critics point to a lack of data, cuts in foreign aid, and significant delays in vaccine distribution as major failures, with only a fraction of pledged doses reaching the continent. This lackluster response raises concerns about the world's preparedness for future pandemics and the virus's potential to become further entrenched in human populations.</p>

The proposed 'Election Rigging Response Act' would temporarily set aside the state's independent commission-drawn maps to create districts more favorable to Democrats. Newsom framed the move as a necessary response to President Trump's efforts to 'rig' the 2026 midterm elections by gaining GOP seats through gerrymandering.

This analysis points to an inconsistency in how the court applies this standard, as it has often been ignored in emergency 'shadow docket' cases involving the Trump administration.

          <p>Under the new federal oversight of Washington D.C.'s law enforcement, the city's police chief has issued an order expanding cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The new policy allows D.C. police to share information about individuals not in their custody and to transport federal agents and detainees. This marks a significant shift from the city's previous 'sanctuary' policies, which limited such collaboration. The change comes as part of President Trump's temporary federalization of the Metropolitan Police Department, which has already resulted in numerous immigration-related arrests in the city.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has argued for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the labor market. Zervos stated that he believes monetary policy is currently too restrictive and advocated for a half-percentage-point cut, a position he has held for several months. He joins a growing list of potential successors to Jerome Powell who are pushing for a more dovish approach from the central bank. Zervos contends that a more market-savvy perspective is needed in monetary policy decisions to better achieve the Fed's mandates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced plans to build over 3,000 new homes in a controversial settlement area known as E1 in the occupied West Bank. Smotrich stated the project would effectively 'bury the idea of a Palestinian state' by cutting off the West Bank from East Jerusalem. The E1 project had been frozen for decades due to intense international opposition, as settlements are considered illegal under international law. The move has been condemned by the U.S., U.K., and E.U. as a breach of international law and a major obstacle to a two-state solution.</p>

Key dates to watch include the release of the September 5 employment report and the September 11 inflation data, which will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's decision.

The write-down reflects the financial pressures from lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit in the kingdom. As a result, the PIF's annualized returns have decreased, and it has broadened its funding base through public and private debt. (not investment advice)</p>

This has temporarily shielded consumers from inflation, but it has also strained warehouse capacity and increased storage costs.
