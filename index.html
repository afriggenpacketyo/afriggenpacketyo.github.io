          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade deal, narrowly avoiding a looming tariff deadline. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. While providing stability, some officials noted the new tariffs will still make transatlantic trade more expensive than before. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant fire has broken out in the West Midlands, involving four factory units and 20 tonnes of tires in the Tipton area. Over 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines are at the scene, battling the blaze which has sent a large plume of smoke visible for miles. Several nearby homes have been evacuated as a precautionary measure, and residents are advised to keep windows and doors closed. No casualties have been reported, but a structural engineer is assessing the buildings due to concerns of collapse.</p>

The deal was finalized ahead of an August 1 deadline for potentially higher tariffs. In the same press availability, Trump addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating the U.S. had provided significant aid but had not been thanked, and he blamed Hamas for stealing food supplies. He also expressed support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while criticizing Iran's rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has formally expressed "deep concern" over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This non-partisan panel provides evidence-based recommendations on crucial preventive care, such as cancer and depression screenings, which insurers are then required to cover. The AMA defended the task force's integrity and urged the administration to retain its members, highlighting the panel's alignment with the goal of improving national health. The move follows criticism from some conservative groups and a previous ousting of a CDC vaccine advisory panel.</p>

His attempts to deflect or distract from questions about his own relationship with Epstein only fuel further suspicion.

          <h2>Israel Announces "Tactical Pause" in Parts of Gaza to Facilitate Humanitarian Aid</h2>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of the Gaza Strip to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. The pause, effective for 10 hours a day in areas like Gaza City and Deir al-Balah, is intended to help the United Nations and other agencies address the severe hunger crisis. This move comes amid intense international pressure and stark images of starving children emerging from the territory. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to adequately reach the entire civilian population in need.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team staged a remarkable defensive performance to secure a draw against England in the fourth Test, keeping the series alive. Facing a significant deficit, India batted for over five sessions in their second innings, with Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar both scoring centuries in an unbroken 203-run partnership. Despite a valiant effort from England's bowlers, particularly captain Ben Stokes, they were unable to take the final wickets needed for a victory. The draw leaves England with a 2-1 series lead heading into the final Test at The Oval.</p>

          <p>German football champions Bayern Munich have reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz. The deal is reported to be worth €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons, after an initial bid was rejected. Diaz, who joined Liverpool in 2022, has been a key player for the club, scoring 13 goals during their Premier League title-winning season last year. He has been given permission to leave Liverpool's pre-season tour to complete a medical, marking a significant transfer for both clubs ahead of the new season.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed "great pause" about the idea, calling her crimes "unforgivable," but deferred the ultimate decision to the president. In contrast, Representative Thomas Massie suggested a deal should be considered if it could compel Maxwell to provide more truthful information about Jeffrey Epstein's network.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced that her party would seek to ban all strike action by NHS doctors if it returns to power. The proposal would introduce legislation for minimum service levels, placing doctors under similar restrictions to those for police and military personnel. The announcement comes as resident doctors are in the midst of a five-day strike over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) criticized the proposal as a "desperate intervention," defending the right to strike as a last resort for doctors.</p>
