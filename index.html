          <p>Ninth-ranked LSU defeated fourth-ranked Clemson with a final score of 17-10 in a defensive battle held in South Carolina. The game saw multiple punts, a fumble, and two field goals early on, with Clemson scoring the first touchdown late in the second half. LSU responded, but fumbled near the end zone, failing to score before halftime. After Clemson missed a field goal, LSU tied the game and later took the lead, ultimately securing the win by preventing Clemson from converting on a crucial fourth down. The game highlighted LSU's defensive strength and offensive resilience under pressure, marking a significant road victory. The final score was hard-fought, showing the determination and skill of both teams, with LSU ultimately emerging victorious with a strong defensive showing. The game's intensity and strategic plays were key to the final outcome.</p>

          <p>Several UK news outlets are covering a range of stories, including allegations that Prince Andrew maintained contact with Jeffrey Epstein later than previously stated, based on newly surfaced emails. Also reported is scrutiny surrounding Angela Rayner's boyfriend's work for a lobbying group that received government funds. Kemi Badenoch's policy shift to maximize North Sea oil and gas extraction is drawing comparisons to Donald Trump's energy policies. Concerns about the black market for weight loss drugs due to rising costs, a poll indicating reluctance to fight for Britain, and Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas's experience with a stalker are also highlighted. Lastly, the Royal Opera House is issuing trigger warnings for a loud curtain-up bell, raising eyebrows and being mocked by some news outlets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tyler Glasnow pitched a stellar game for the Dodgers, taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but the team ultimately lost 6-1 to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Glasnow's efforts were undermined by a lack of offensive support, continuing a season-long trend where the Dodgers have struggled to score runs behind him. The loss narrows the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game. Arizona's Eduardo Rodriguez also pitched well, contributing to the Dodgers' struggles against pitchers with ERAs over 5.00, as they have lost all four such games recently. The Dodgers' offensive struggles and inability to capitalize with runners in scoring position contributed to the defeat, despite Glasnow's strong outing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Sun, founder of Tron, envisions surpassing SWIFT in transaction volume within five years, estimating Tron's transaction volume to reach US$8 trillion this year. He anticipates scaling the volume to US$300-400 trillion, potentially exceeding SWIFT's capacity by tenfold. Sun highlights Tron's transaction speed, processing transactions in seconds compared to SWIFT's days. This confidence stems from Tron's growing influence in stablecoin transactions globally, as stablecoins maintain a fixed value by being pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Tron is poised to become a major player in the virtual asset sector, challenging traditional financial systems with its speed and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people marched across Mexico to protest the country's widespread enforced disappearances, demanding government action to address the crisis. Relatives, friends, and human rights activists participated in demonstrations in multiple cities, urging President Claudia Sheinbaum to help find the over 130,000 missing individuals. The majority of disappearances have occurred since 2007, coinciding with the launch of the "war on drugs." Drug cartels and security forces are implicated in these disappearances, with many forcibly recruited or killed for resisting. The protests highlight the pervasive impact of forced disappearances on communities throughout Mexico, reflecting a human tragedy of enormous proportions.</p>

The order directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights and submit Freedom of Information Act requests to gather data on federal immigration enforcement activity.

The author questions whether Hayes, who arranged the meeting and invited Tichelman to inject him with heroin, should be held less accountable for his own death. The author also points out that Tichelman's actions after the overdose, including not calling 911, contributed to the tragedy. Ultimately, the author concludes that the questions of blame and accountability in this case reside not in forensics, but in ethics.

The move follows a federal judge's order to stop Lake from firing the VOA director and to restore VOA's operations. The layoffs align with President Trump's directive to reduce federal bureaucracy and cut funding for international broadcasters. The action is condemned by agency employees who have sued to block the VOA's elimination.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a longtime CBS News correspondent, has died at the age of 73 in Washington, D.C. Known as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician, Knoller meticulously tracked every presidential action, movement, and utterance. He generously shared his vast knowledge with reporters, historians, and White House aides alike. Knoller began his career in radio and later reinvented himself on Twitter, amassing a large following. Colleagues remember him as a dedicated, kind, and witty journalist. Knoller's passing marks the end of an era for the White House press corps, leaving a void in institutional knowledge and generous spirit.</p>

          <p>The Stringfellow family, showpeople who have lived on a yard in Govan near Glasgow's River Clyde for over 40 years, are fighting eviction in Scotland's highest court. Glasgow City Council seeks to redevelop the area, which the family has occupied since the 1980s, but the family claims the council has threatened them with eviction over 20 times. The case tests the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, arguing eviction would breach a child's right to a secure home. The Stringfellows argue that offered alternative sites are unsuitable. The outcome could set a legal precedent affecting other showpeople and residents in similar situations.</p>

          <p>Beer sales in Germany are declining, but non-alcoholic beer is gaining popularity, with sales more than doubling since 2013. Overall beer sales have fallen to their lowest level in over 30 years, dropping 6.3% in the first half of 2025. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting non-alcoholic beer at sporting events as a healthy alternative to energy drinks. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic drinks. Despite this shift, traditional beer culture remains strong, especially in regions like Bavaria, where beer consumption remains a significant part of daily life.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, titled Metal Gear Solid Delta, years after Hideo Kojima, the series creator, left the company. The Metal Gear series, known for its cinematic storytelling and tackling complex themes, faced uncertainty after Kojima's departure in 2015. The split between Kojima and Konami reportedly stemmed from the spiraling costs of Metal Gear Solid V. The remake aims to capture the essence of the original game with improved graphics and audio. Fans are excited about the remake, with some noting that it is faithful to the original vision.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are increasingly facing abuse and intimidation from other road users, with incidents ranging from tailgating to physical assault.

Traffic officers urge drivers to show more empathy and kindness towards learner drivers. The incidents highlight the need for greater awareness and enforcement to protect vulnerable road users.</p>

          <p>Doctors discovered a bullet fragment lodged in the neck of Weston Halsne, a 10-year-old survivor of the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis. Halsne credited his friend for saving his life by acting as a human shield during the attack. The bullet fragment is dangerously close to an artery, requiring surgery for its removal. The family has started a GoFundMe campaign to help cover the medical costs. Halsne was just two seats away from the stained-glass windows when the shooter fired through, feeling something like gunpowder on his neck.

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show called 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' hosted by Davina McCall, combining elements of Love Island, Married at First Sight, and Survivor. Contestants meet for just five minutes before being matched by experts and embarking on a honeymoon on a remote island. The show aims to discover if love can thrive in isolation, stripping away the superficiality often found in other dating shows. Contestants emphasize the authenticity and challenge of the experience, focusing on genuine connections rather than seeking fame or brand deals. The show also features slightly older contestants, reflecting a trend of people settling down later in life.</p>

          <p>The Bayeux Tapestry, a nearly 1,000-year-old artwork documenting the Norman invasion of England, will be closed to the public in France before its loan to the British Museum.

French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced the loan in July. Opponents argue that the vibrations during a long journey by road could cause irreparable damage.

          <p>UK scientists are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetle, which has devastated spruce trees across Europe, was initially thought to be contained by checking imported wood products. However, it was discovered that the beetles were being carried by winds across the English Channel. Scientists claim the UK has eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and southeast. Climate change, however, could make the job even harder in the future, requiring continued vigilance and innovative strategies.</p>
