          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 12:39:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details a shift in chronic pain research toward a "bedside to the bench" approach. This method prioritizes patients' real-world experiences to guide laboratory studies, a reversal of the traditional research process. The article highlights groundbreaking work at UCSF where scientists have successfully mapped the unique neural signatures of chronic pain in individuals' brains. This has enabled them to predict pain bursts and use deep brain stimulation to interrupt the signals, offering a potential future where pain is objectively measured and treated with precision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest and Lloyds, fell sharply after a proposal for a new windfall tax on their profits was publicized. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to offset taxpayer costs associated with the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that rising interest rates have created unintended, substantial profits for commercial banks at the public's expense. Financial industry body UK Finance countered that an additional tax would harm Britain's international competitiveness and contradict the government's growth objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge heard arguments regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary order to prevent President Donald Trump from firing her. Cook's attorney argued that the president's justification, based on unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations from a political operative, does not constitute legal cause for removal. In contrast, a Department of Justice lawyer contended that determining legal cause is at the president's discretion. The judge has not yet ruled, leaving the fate of Cook, whose term extends to 2038, uncertain and highlighting a significant conflict over the independence of the central bank.</p>

Separately, President Trump has faced criticism for playing music on a new sound system in the Rose Garden during press briefings. The administration is also increasing pressure on the Smithsonian Institution, with Trump meeting its secretary amid demands for the White House to review the museum's exhibitions and materials for being overly critical of American history.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was decisively defeated by ninth-seed Elena Rybakina in the third round of the US Open, with a final score of 6-1, 6-2. Raducanu, who won the tournament in 2021, struggled against Rybakina's powerful serves and dominant baseline play, failing to gain momentum throughout the match. The loss serves as a reality check for the 22-year-old, who had been showing signs of a return to form and was hoping for a significant win against a top-ranked opponent.

          <p>An editorial uses President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook as a starting point to critique the unquestioned defense of the Fed's independence. The article argues that while political interference for electoral gain is dangerous, the Fed's current structure is not a purely neutral technocracy, often favoring business elites over labor and consumers. It suggests that true democratic control over monetary policy requires more than just independence from elected officials. The piece posits that the goal should be to reimagine a central bank that is more accountable to the public, potentially through new structures that align its actions with broader societal priorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that a series of actions by the Trump administration points toward a deliberate move to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms. The author cites the deployment of the National Guard to cities, raids on critics' homes, and the attempt to remove a Federal Reserve governor as part of a pattern to neutralize any institution that could act as a check on presidential power. The article suggests that these events are often so blatant that they are paradoxically discounted by the public. It concludes by warning that both domestic and international observers must recognize these developments as a serious shift toward autocracy.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card debt in the U.S., this article outlines several debt relief strategies for individuals facing financial hardship. Options range from traditional debt consolidation loans, which combine multiple debts into one payment, to debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies that negotiate lower interest rates. The piece also covers debt forgiveness programs, where companies negotiate to reduce the total amount owed, and internal forbearance programs from credit card issuers. Each option has different qualification requirements based on factors like credit score, income, and the level of financial distress, requiring careful consideration of the associated trade-offs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of multigenerational, large-scale ranches in the American West are being listed for sale as heirs find it difficult to manage the properties or prefer to cash out their inheritance. High-end brokers report a significant increase in inventory for these so-called trophy properties, driven by family disagreements and a generational shift away from ranching life. Demand remains strong, partly due to the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy, vast open spaces, and a connection to nature. These legacy properties often command premium prices due to their history, acreage, and surrounding undeveloped public lands.</p>

These teams will collaborate with local law enforcement to target high-crime areas, focusing on repeat offenders and the seizure of illegal weapons and narcotics. The White House criticized the move, with a spokesperson telling Fox News that Newsom was merely "copying the Trump agenda" after previously denouncing the president's use of the National Guard.

          <p>This analysis argues that California Governor Gavin Newsom's deployment of state highway patrol officers is fundamentally different from President Trump's use of the National Guard. While both actions aim to address public concerns about crime, Newsom's strategy involves using trained police officers for targeted, data-driven enforcement in partnership with local agencies. In contrast, the use of military troops is framed as a tool of repression that is less suited for civilian law enforcement. The article suggests Newsom's move acknowledges the need for enforcement but remains within a broader state framework that also emphasizes police reform and rehabilitation programs.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's push for a "pro-American" version of history, including reviewing Smithsonian exhibitions, exposes a critical flaw in the U.S. education system. For decades, the focus has shifted from the liberal arts to STEM and vocational training, leaving citizens without the critical thinking and historical literacy skills necessary for self-government. The author contends that the humanities cultivate empathy and the ability to evaluate complex arguments, which are essential defenses against propaganda. The current culture war over history is presented as a direct consequence of devaluing an education designed to create informed citizens.</p>

          <p>In a televised interview, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recent leadership shakeup at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stating it was necessary and expressing confidence in HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. When asked about the potential release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Johnson suggested that recent document handovers to the House Oversight Committee might make a full floor vote unnecessary. Following the recent Minneapolis school shooting, he expressed openness to bipartisan solutions addressing mental health but emphasized that the focus should not be on restricting the constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners.</p>

          <p>The parents of the two children killed in the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school have identified them as eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel and ten-year-old Harper Moyski. The attack, which also injured 17 others, was carried out by a 23-year-old former student who police say had a "deranged fascination" with mass shooters before taking their own life. In public statements, the grieving families remembered their children and made urgent calls for political leaders to take meaningful action to address both the gun violence epidemic and the nation's ongoing mental health crisis.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates screening a record 17.5 million travelers over the Labor Day holiday period, capping off a busy summer travel season. The forecast comes as airports are already experiencing disruptions, including a communications outage at a key air traffic control facility that caused hundreds of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Despite these challenges, airlines like American and United are preparing to fly approximately 7 million passengers over the weekend. For those traveling by car, gas prices are slightly lower on average than last year, providing some relief for road trippers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing trade rule known as the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, has been eliminated by the Trump administration. This policy change will primarily affect direct-to-consumer e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu, as well as small overseas businesses that ship directly to U.S. customers. The White House justified the move by citing the need to close a loophole that harms American manufacturers and poses a national security risk. Consumers are likely to see price increases and shipping delays as businesses adjust to applying tariffs to millions of small shipments.</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has canceled a €10 million contract that would have expanded the use of Huawei's fiber-optic technology in a public network spanning the country. The digital transformation ministry intervened at the last minute to block the deal, citing the need to protect Spain's "strategic autonomy." This decision aligns Madrid more closely with directives from the European Union, which has urged member states to remove high-risk vendors like Huawei from their critical 5G networks due to security concerns. The move reverses a recent trend where Spain had been increasing its reliance on the Chinese tech giant's equipment.</p>

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that two individuals have died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria, from consuming raw oysters. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters and can cause severe illness, including necrotizing fasciitis, which has a high mortality rate. So far this year, Louisiana has recorded 22 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection, resulting in four deaths total, with two linked to raw oyster consumption and two from wound exposure to seawater. State officials note that this represents a significant increase compared to the average of seven infections and one death per year.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are taking hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) retirement accounts to cover financial emergencies, with Vanguard reporting a notable increase in 2024. While legislative changes have made it easier to access these funds penalty-free for urgent needs, financial planners advise that this should be a last resort. Tapping retirement savings is costly due to income taxes and the loss of future compound growth. Experts recommend building an emergency fund as the first line of defense, followed by alternatives like a 401(k) loan or a home equity line of credit before sacrificing long-term retirement security.</p>

          <p>A significant crash in the cryptocurrency market has resulted in over $411 million in liquidations, with the majority coming from long positions. Bitcoin's price fell by 2.9%, dropping to the $110,000 level and triggering a wider sell-off across the market. Major altcoins experienced even steeper declines, with Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin among the hardest hit. Market analysts are now watching key support levels, with some predicting that Bitcoin could see a further correction toward the $100,000 or $105,000 mark if the current downward momentum continues without a reversal.

          <p>A new report supported by the United Nations reveals that more than 14,000 migrants, predominantly from Venezuela, have abandoned their journey to the U.S. and are heading south again. This "reverse flow" phenomenon is a direct result of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has made it nearly impossible for asylum seekers to legally enter the country. Northward migration through the dangerous Darién Gap has plummeted by 97% this year. The report highlights the extreme vulnerability of these returning migrants, who often have depleted funds and face exploitation by criminal groups in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has informed Congress he will not spend $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid, using a rare procedural tool known as a "pocket rescission." This move involves submitting a request to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that Congress does not have the required 45 days to act, causing the funds to expire. The funding was allocated for the State Department and USAID, agencies that have been frequent targets of the administration's budget-cutting efforts. This action effectively bypasses the legislative branch on spending decisions, raising concerns about the separation of powers.</p>

Wilkins' complaint states that she is an American-born country singer who is not Jewish and has never been to Israel. Seraphin, a self-described whistleblower, is accused of fabricating the story for self-enriching clickbait by leveraging his past FBI credentials to lend credibility to the claims.</p>
