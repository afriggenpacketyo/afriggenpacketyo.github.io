          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled state legislature from achieving a quorum needed to pass a new congressional map. The proposed map, backed by former President Trump, would significantly favor the GOP in future elections by redrawing districts to create more Republican-leaning seats. The Democrats, who traveled to Chicago, argue the move is necessary to fight a "racist, gerrymandered map" and protect the democratic process from what they call a partisan power grab. This action effectively halts the special legislative session, which also included disaster relief funding on its agenda.</p>

          <p>Over 3,000 unionized workers at Boeing's defense manufacturing facilities in Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The dispute centers on disagreements over pay, work schedules, and pension plans for the employees who build military aircraft like the F-15 fighter jet. This walkout represents another significant challenge for Boeing, which has been contending with numerous issues, including major safety concerns and a costly strike in its passenger plane division last year. The union stated the action is about securing "respect and dignity" for its members.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 157 migrants, predominantly from Ethiopia, has capsized in severe weather off the coast of Yemen, resulting in at least 68 deaths. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), only 12 people have been rescued, with dozens still missing. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, which is often facilitated by smugglers. The IOM has called for enhanced legal migration pathways to prevent such tragedies, noting that thousands have died on this perilous journey over the past decade.</p>

          <p>In response to Democratic legislators leaving Texas to block a redistricting vote, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove them from office if they do not return. Citing a non-binding legal opinion, Abbott set a deadline for their return, escalating the political standoff over a new congressional map favored by Republicans. The governor's aggressive stance marks a significant development in the ongoing conflict, which also puts disaster relief funding on hold. This high-stakes confrontation highlights the intense national battle over gerrymandering and its potential impact on the U.S. House majority.</p>

          <p>Former Arsenal star Santi Cazorla is set to play his final season of professional football with Real Oviedo, the club where his career began. The 40-year-old midfielder's journey is a story of remarkable perseverance, having overcome a career-threatening ankle injury that required 11 operations and nearly led to amputation. After helping Oviedo secure promotion to Spain's La Liga for the first time in 24 years, Cazorla has signed a one-year contract to conclude his career on his own terms. He credits his family's support for his comeback and expresses deep gratitude for the opportunity to finish playing for his beloved hometown team.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement in Montana continues a large-scale manhunt for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda. The suspect, considered armed and dangerous, is believed to have fled into the rugged wilderness he knows from his youth. Authorities have closed off national forest areas and are using ground and air assets in the search, which involves multiple local, state, and federal agencies. The victims were regulars at the bar and known to the suspect, leaving the small, tight-knit community in a state of shock and fear.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported its first monthly decline in deliveries this year, signaling the impact of a fierce price war in the country's EV market. The company shipped over 341,000 units in July, a drop from the previous month, as it and other major players like Li Auto and Nio also saw decreased sales. This downturn follows months of aggressive discounting, which has drawn concern from Beijing policymakers about excessive competition. In contrast, competitors like Xpeng and Xiaomi reported strong monthly growth, indicating a significant reshaping of the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

The case has sent shockwaves through Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption among public officials. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare cancer, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy."</p>

          <p>This article posits that Manchester City's most significant summer acquisition may be new assistant coach Pep Lijnders, formerly Jürgen Klopp's right-hand man at Liverpool. The hiring suggests manager Pep Guardiola is planning a major tactical evolution away from his traditional possession-based "positional play." The analysis argues that modern football is shifting towards the more direct, high-intensity, transitional style championed by Klopp and Lijnders. Recent player signings like Omar Marmoush and Rayan Cherki, who excel at carrying the ball, further support the theory that City is adapting to a more dynamic and vertical approach.</p>

While some women are deliberately choosing to be childless, researchers point to a "fertility gap," where people desire more children than they have.

          <p>In this personal commentary, author Rokhaya Diallo argues that French Muslims are perpetually treated as a suspicious "enemy within," no matter their profession or level of integration into society. She recounts personal experiences of being asked to publicly denounce terrorism and facing accusations of inciting hatred for criticizing Islamophobia. The author contends that the French state and media fuel a narrative that conflates all Muslims with radicalism, using terms like "infiltration" and "separatism" to create a no-win situation. This climate of suspicion, she writes, affects everyone from famous footballers to fashion influencers and fosters a dangerous environment.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump commented on the controversy surrounding actress Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle ad campaign, stating he now "loves" the ad upon learning she is a registered Republican. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had sparked a mix of backlash and praise online, with some critics claiming it had racial undertones. Public records indicate the "Euphoria" actress is registered with the Republican Party of Florida. Trump's remarks add a political dimension to the cultural debate over the ad campaign, which has been defended by some as a rejection of "woke" advertising.</p>

An Israeli official indicated a growing belief that Hamas is not interested in a negotiated deal, prompting Netanyahu to consider expanding military operations.

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has left seven inmates dead and eleven others wounded, according to regional authorities. The unrest, which included fires set within the facility, reportedly broke out due to inmates' anger over alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization inside the prison. The incident highlights the persistent problems of gang control, corruption, and overcrowding within Mexico's penal system. The Tuxpan prison was operating over its designed capacity at the time of the deadly riot.</p>

Researchers and volunteers are driven by a desire to provide closure for aging survivors and to properly honor the victims.

          <p>China has firmly pushed back against U.S. demands that it cease buying oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and energy security. The issue has become a major point of contention in broader trade negotiations, with the U.S. threatening a 100% tariff if China does not comply. Beijing's defiant stance underscores its confidence in challenging Washington on policies that link trade with its foreign and energy strategies. For the U.S., restricting these oil sales is a key tool to limit the military funding available to Moscow and Tehran. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese researchers have proposed a new system to dramatically increase the survival rate of combat drones. The concept involves equipping small or medium-sized drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow a drone to perform an instantaneous, high-G maneuver in the final moments before a missile impact, making it nearly impossible for the missile to track. Digital simulations published in a Chinese defense journal showed the system could improve a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent.</p>
