          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, defended the company's substantial capital expenditure plans, projecting $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, surpassing analyst estimates.

          <p>A federal judge appointed by President Clinton issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration, preventing it from curtailing collective bargaining rights for foreign service workers. The lawsuit was filed by the American Foreign Service Association following an executive order by President Trump aimed at ending collective bargaining within government entities with national security missions. The judge's order stated that Trump's executive order was unlawful as applied to the heads of agencies with employees represented by the plaintiff. A White House spokesperson defended the executive order, asserting that President Trump would always prioritize public safety and national security.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing challenges for the economy and central banks. This warning comes after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady amidst economic uncertainty and concerns over the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell acknowledged that the economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, with longer-term interest rates now considerably higher. Recent trade deal announcements have boosted the stock market, but analysts note that high tariffs are likely to persist.</p>
