          <p>Annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, marking the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. The government has also increased maintenance loans to assist students with escalating living costs, as universities face significant financial pressures from inflation. This comes as student housing costs have sharply increased, with a recent survey indicating that 68% of full-time undergraduates now hold paid jobs during term time. The article also notes that recent changes to loan repayment rules will likely increase the total amount graduates pay back over a longer period. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's IPO performance is a major positive development in a previously stagnant tech IPO market, with its valuation now exceeding $68 billion, more than triple Adobe's failed acquisition offer. This outcome highlights a renewed investor appetite for tech stocks and has provided significant returns for early investors after a prolonged period of limited exits for venture firms.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced a new schedule of tariffs for more than 60 countries, which are set to take effect in seven days. The duties range from a baseline of 10% to as high as 41% for Syria, formalizing rates for nations both with and without recent trade agreements with the U.S. Notably, tariffs on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA will increase to 35%, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension on negotiations. The move is part of a broader strategy to reshape international trade rules, though it has fallen short of an earlier goal to secure 90 deals in 90 days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several MLB teams executed major trades to strengthen their rosters for the postseason push before Thursday's deadline. The Houston Astros reacquired former star Carlos Correa, while the New York Yankees overhauled their bullpen by adding three new relievers, including All-Stars David Bednar and Camilo Doval. The New York Mets also bolstered their bullpen and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins, and the San Diego Padres made an aggressive series of seven acquisitions, most notably All-Star closer Mason Miller. These moves signal teams' intentions to make a serious run in the final months of the season, significantly altering the competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is drafting legislation to add $18 billion to the state's wildfire victim fund, which is at risk of depletion following recent deadly fires. The plan proposes that the state's three largest utilities and their customers would each contribute $9 billion to replenish the fund, which was established in 2019 to shield utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparks fires. This proposal comes as the original $21 billion fund could be exhausted by claims from events like the Eaton wildfire. Consumer advocates and utility executives have expressed concerns over the financial burden on ratepayers and shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling postpones the terminations until a November hearing, providing a reprieve for individuals whose status was set to expire in early August, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for over two decades. In her decision, the judge criticized the administration's actions, stating they appeared to be based on a "preordained determination to end the TPS program" rather than an objective review of current country conditions, which remain unsafe for return according to some advisories.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made over 109,000 arrests in the first five months of President Trump's second term, a 120% increase from the same period in 2024. The majority of these arrests occurred in border and Southern states, with Texas accounting for nearly a quarter of the total. Most of the individuals arrested were from Latin American and Caribbean countries. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation with ICE in states like Texas and Florida, as well as the demographic makeup of immigrant communities in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising discovery published in the journal Cell, scientists have determined that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. Researchers found that the potato inherited a crucial gene from the ancient tomato that signals the plant to form its starchy tubers. This finding solves a long-standing puzzle about the potato's origins, as its closest look-alike relative does not produce tubers. The study, which analyzed hundreds of potato genomes, demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can lead to the emergence of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered that China is continuing to purchase sanctioned Iranian oil by using a "dark fleet" of tankers that conduct covert ship-to-ship transfers in international waters. This illicit trade, which generates billions for Iran, is often conducted off the coast of Malaysia, where tankers turn off their transponders and obscure their identities to avoid detection. The practice undermines U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program, with the investigation observing numerous such transfers in a single day. Despite new U.S. sanctions, this activity appears to be increasing, highlighting the challenges of enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following the death of her 79-year-old mother in a car crash, a woman is calling for an overhaul of the UK's "unsafe and inadequate" rules for older drivers. Currently, drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, with no mandatory testing. Department of Transport statistics show that people over 75 are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured in a crash. While some older drivers in rural areas see driving as a lifeline, experts and families of victims argue for mandatory medical reporting by health professionals and regular assessments to improve road safety.</p>

However, the proposal faces strong opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor over concerns about increased air pollution, noise, and climate impact.

He chose to continue the tour to prove his mental tenacity despite the physical and mental toll of the illness, which is caused by a bacterial infection from tick bites. Timberlake stated he wanted to be more transparent about his struggles with fans and thanked them for their support.</p>

          <p>Social media companies are blocking a wide range of content, including news about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and parliamentary debates, to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act. A BBC Verify investigation found that platforms like X and Reddit are restricting posts for users who have not completed age verification, in an effort to protect minors from harmful material. Experts warn that companies are over-applying the law, risking the suppression of legitimate public interest content and stifling debate. The act imposes heavy fines for failure to protect children, but regulators have also warned against breaching freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively available to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change is part of a ministerial effort to diversify Whitehall and ensure it better reflects the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The move aims to address the underrepresentation of working-class individuals in senior government roles and harness a broader range of talent.</p>

          <p>Amid pressure from Wall Street to detail its AI strategy, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is "very open" to mergers and acquisitions to accelerate its roadmap. During an earnings call, Cook confirmed that Apple is significantly increasing its investments in AI and has already acquired around seven smaller companies this year, though not all were AI-focused. This comes as competitors like Google and Microsoft are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure. Cook emphasized that Apple's focus is on creating deeply personal and private AI features that are seamlessly integrated across its platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has outlined a plan to potentially hold a special election in California on November 4 to approve new congressional maps. This move is a direct response to President Trump's call for Republican-controlled states to redraw their districts to maintain a House majority in the 2026 midterm elections. Under Newsom's proposal, the legislature would ask voters to adopt new, pre-drawn maps that would remain in effect until 2030, after which the state would revert to its independent redistricting commission. Newsom cast the strategy as a necessary, transparent response to attempts to "rig the game" at the national level.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, making him the ninth person put to death in the state this year. This sets a new single-year record for executions in Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was convicted of the killings after his wife sought a divorce. Opponents of the execution highlighted his military service and the fact that his jury's 7-5 vote for the death penalty would not meet the threshold required under current state law. The state has now carried out more executions than any other in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. Unlike other National League contenders who made blockbuster deals, the Dodgers' front office chose to maintain faith in its current roster rather than pursuing high-priced stars. Team executives had foreshadowed this strategy, expressing confidence that their talented group, once fully healthy and performing to established levels, is capable of another World Series run. The approach prioritizes internal improvement and relies on the return of injured players and the resurgence of slumping stars for the season's final stretch.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, FICO CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure against criticism from the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, at $4.95 for a mortgage, is a very small part of closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. This follows the FHFA's recent decision to allow mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore, with the agency's head calling FICO a "monopoly." Lansing countered that FICO has consistently won in the open market and that the new policy raises safety and soundness concerns for the mortgage system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting a final meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, providing a temporary reprieve for the landmark establishment and its staff. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the business model remains challenging and is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the historic value of the city's oldest restaurant.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration is claiming victory after securing several trade deals and imposing new tariffs without triggering immediate financial panic, the long-term consequences remain uncertain. The aggressive strategy has forced some agreements but has also increased the cost of importing goods into the U.S. and created significant uncertainty for global trade. While the worst-case recession scenarios have been avoided for now, economists warn that the new tariffs will raise prices for U.S. consumers and could damage the global economy. The approach may also push long-time allies to form new alliances that bypass the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could enable millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commissions. The court will decide whether to uphold a finding that secret commission payments made by lenders to car dealers were unlawful. With around 90% of new cars bought on finance, a decision in favor of consumers could lead to billions of pounds in claims, similar in scale to the PPI scandal. Lenders have set aside large sums in anticipation, while the government has expressed concern over the potential economic impact of massive redress payments on the motor finance sector.
