          <p>President Trump's push for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza has yet to gain firm commitment from either Israel or Hamas, with both sides indicating reservations. The proposal faces significant political obstacles within Israel's government, where far-right cabinet members have threatened to block any deal. This article also details the controversy surrounding the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is under scrutiny following reports of hundreds of civilian deaths at its aid distribution sites, a situation its director has struggled to address.</p>

          <p>A verdict has been reached in the high-profile federal trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faced five counts including sex trafficking and racketeering.

          <p>Following a significant increase in job cuts across the U.S., a large percentage of American workers are reporting heightened anxiety about their job security. Experts observe this widespread fear can create a "vicious cycle" where employees overwork themselves in an attempt to prove their value, paradoxically leading to faster burnout and decreased productivity. To combat this, professionals advise creating a proactive plan, such as updating a resume and reconnecting with professional networks, to regain a sense of control.</p>

          <p>This article is a personal, photographic reflection from a journalist on their favorite place in Taiwan: the ancient red cypress forests of Alishan. Described as a stunning region of misty mountains and high-altitude tea, the forests offered the author a profound sense of timelessness and inner calm after years of stressful reporting. The author shares a moment when the sun's rays broke through the trees, an image another hiker aptly described as "god's smile," illustrating the area's deep natural beauty.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court has issued a significant 4-3 ruling stating that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. The decision by the court's liberal majority clarifies that the old statute was effectively superseded by comprehensive legislation passed over the last 50 years to regulate the procedure. This ruling resolves a major legal gray area that emerged after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, allowing abortions to continue in the state.</p>

In response, the city has suspended services like residential trash collection and closed some public pools, while the mayor maintains that the city has already made its best contract offer.</p>

          <p>A new UN-backed report has described the severe droughts experienced globally over the past two years as a "silent killer" and a "slow-moving global catastrophe." The report details devastating impacts in regions like the Horn of Africa and the Mediterranean, where climate change and an El NiÃ±o event have worsened food insecurity, poverty, and ecosystem collapse. It strongly urges governments to prepare for a "new normal" by strengthening early warning systems and addressing the far-reaching societal consequences of drought.</p>
