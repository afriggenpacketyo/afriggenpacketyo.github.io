          <p>The FBI has recovered a high-powered bolt action rifle, believed to be the weapon used in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Officials are actively tracking the college-aged suspect's movements, possessing "good" video footage, and collecting forensic evidence like footwear and palm prints. The attack is deemed "targeted," with authorities vowing to apprehend the individual. President Trump announced a posthumous Medal of Freedom for Kirk, attributing political violence to "radical Left" rhetoric. Utah Governor Spencer Cox also lamented the nation's divisions, citing recent political attacks, underscoring the profound impact of this tragic event on the national political discourse.</p>

          <p>New York City police have apprehended Jamel McGriff, the suspect in the horrific murder of elderly couple Frank and Maureen Olton in Queens, followed by setting their home ablaze. McGriff, who has a lengthy criminal history and was on probation, spent five hours inside their home after Frank Olton allowed him into the backyard to charge his phone. The Oltons were later found dead, with Mr. Olton tied and stabbed, and Mrs. Olton severely burned. The motive remains unclear, but the suspect's modus operandi involves gaining entry by asking for assistance. The killings have deeply shaken the community, prompting warnings about home security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. inflation accelerated in August 2025, with the Consumer Price Index rising 2.9% year-over-year, up from 2.7% in July, marking the fastest annual pace since January. Economists attribute this surge primarily to re-inflation in consumer goods, with "core" commodities seeing their fastest annual rise since May 2023. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are identified as a major contributor to rising goods prices, affecting categories like apparel and household furnishings. Grocery prices also increased significantly. Services inflation has stalled, providing little counterbalance. The article suggests the Federal Reserve faces a difficult choice, potentially cutting rates to support the job market but risking further inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Opendoor stock experienced a significant surge, rocketing 50% higher on Thursday, after the company announced Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. This leadership change propelled the meme stock to a 52-week high, continuing a remarkable year with shares up over 400%. The previous CEO resigned amid investor pressure, notably from Rabois and hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who championed Opendoor's turnaround. The company had faced potential delisting earlier this year when its shares traded below $1, making this executive transition a pivotal moment for its recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh announced bans on gas-powered motorbikes from Hanoi's central Ring Road 1 by mid-2026, with further restrictions planned for 2028 and 2030. Similar policies are being discussed for Ho Chi Minh City, aiming for 22% of motorbikes to be electric nationwide by 2030. While supported by environmental and industrial goals, the move raises concerns among informal workers about affordability and infrastructure. Vietnamese brands like VinFast and Pega are dominating the booming electric motorbike market.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent 31-year-old conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot at Utah Valley University. He co-founded Turning Point USA at age 18 to promote conservative ideals among young people, becoming known for his campus debates on topics like gun control, climate change, and anti-transgender views. Kirk was credited with mobilizing youth support for Trump and authored "The Maga Doctrine," reflecting his significant influence within the conservative youth movement. His evangelical Christian faith and young family were central to his public persona. The ongoing manhunt for his attacker, described as "college age" and "dressed in black," continues as authorities analyze evidence from the scene, highlighting the tragic loss of a polarizing figure.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage faces intense questions regarding the funding of his £885,000 Clacton constituency home, which was purchased in his partner Laure Ferrari's name without a mortgage. Farage denies avoiding over £44,000 in stamp duty, claiming Ferrari used her own funds from a wealthy French family. However, a BBC investigation found no evidence supporting her family's means for such a significant contribution. Farage, who criticized Angela Rayner for similar tax issues, has sought legal advice but refused to clarify if his own earned funds were involved.

Chinese officials are engaging in discussions to manage expectations for a potential meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping. This diplomatic push aims to de-escalate trade tensions, though the aggressive tariff policies indicate a complex and challenging path toward resolution.

This is the clearest statement yet on the president's intent to halt the nascent industry. Trump's executive order on his first day in office barred new leases, and the Interior Department is now scrutinizing five offshore wind farms already under construction, some of which have faced stop-work orders.

          <p>Thailand has lifted a decades-long ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term Myanmar refugees living in border camps. This policy shift comes after the U.S. under President Donald Trump significantly cut humanitarian aid, leading to cancelled food rations and an "emergency funding appeal." The influx of new refugees from Myanmar's civil war exacerbated the crisis. Welcomed by the UNHCR as a "turning point," the move aims to foster self-sufficiency and stimulate the local economy, potentially filling labor shortages left by departing Cambodian workers. While a landmark step, challenges remain regarding skill sets and ensuring comprehensive healthcare access for the refugees.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs survey reveals that ultra-wealthy family offices are increasing their allocation to public equities to 31% while reducing private equity investments to 21%. This shift, particularly notable in the U.S. and Americas, indicates a "pro-risk asset mix" despite geopolitical and inflation concerns, including expectations of continued high tariffs. Family offices leverage their long-term investment horizon to opportunistically invest during market dislocations. They show strong interest in artificial intelligence, primarily through public equities and ETFs.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US is under scrutiny following new revelations about Mandelson's continued association with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Downing Street acknowledged prior knowledge of the Epstein connection but claimed the "depth and extent" was materially different from what was initially known. Mandelson's allies defended his appointment, citing his success in building White House relations, but the escalating details and the peer's encouragement for Epstein to challenge his conviction ultimately led to his sacking. This controversy now casts doubt on Starmer's judgment and the vetting process for high-level diplomatic roles.</p>

Michaelson, known for his interviews with California Governor Gavin Newsom, plans to feature "West Coast thought leaders." The move comes after CNN previously sought to appeal to Republican viewers, and the program is strategically timed as California faces a crucial redistricting vote impacting national politics.

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University while debating gun violence, an event law enforcement is treating as an assassination. Eyewitnesses described the single shot, believed to have come from a building roof 130 meters away, causing chaos. A massive manhunt is underway, though two initial arrests were later deemed unrelated. Kirk, a 31-year-old Trump ally and founder of Turning Point USA, was known for his campus debates and conservative views. His death has sparked widespread political shock, grief, and anger, with leaders across the spectrum condemning the violence, even as partisan divisions quickly emerged regarding the perpetrator's motives and the broader context of increasing political violence in the US.</p>

The Fed, under pressure from President Trump, aims for a 2% inflation target but faces a dual mandate of full employment and price stability.
