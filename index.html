          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to phase out artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply within two years, targeting dyes used in cereals, ice cream, snacks, and yogurts. This initiative follows the previous administration's move to ban Red No. 3 due to its carcinogenic effects in rats, Kennedy will seek to remove the eight other petroleum-based dyes approved by the FDA. The move reflects growing concerns about the potential health effects of these dyes, with studies suggesting links to hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children, with twenty-six states considering similar legislation around banning food dyes or other chemical additives in foods.</p>

          <p>Germany's beer exports have decreased by 6% over the past decade, while domestic consumption has seen a more significant drop of 15.1%. Despite this decline, the number of breweries in Germany has increased, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences towards non-alcoholic beer and a growing awareness of the negative health consequences of drinking. The statistics were released ahead of German Beer Day, which celebrates the Reinheitsgebot or Purity Law adopted in Bavaria in 1516. While exports are down, they constitute a larger percentage of overall beer sales than a decade ago.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar momentarily fell below 140 yen, a level not seen since last September, after comments made by former U.S. President Donald Trump criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. This, coupled with speculation about potential U.S. pressure on Japan to address the yen's weakness, led to increased yen buying. Analysts suggest the dollar's decline was influenced by concerns over central bank independence rather than expectations of further rate cuts. Safe-haven assets, like gold, saw increased interest amidst the economic uncertainty, reaching an all-time high in yen terms.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has granted a temporary restraining order, compelling the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose visas were allegedly unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), potentially leading to deportation. The judge ordered the administration to notify the court upon compliance and prohibited the use of plaintiffs' identities outside the lawsuit. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday to further address the matter.</p>

          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists reveals a significant majority believe the United States is rapidly moving away from liberal democracy towards authoritarianism. The Bright Line Watch survey indicates a sharp decline in the rating of American democracy since former President Trump's election, with scholars citing concerns about government interference with the press, punishment of political opponents, and the ability of the legislature and judiciary to check executive authority. While some disagree, many scholars specializing in democracy and authoritarianism are troubled by perceived attempts to expand executive power. Some scholars are comparing the U.S. to countries with 'competitive authoritarianism,' where leaders erode checks and balances after coming to power democratically.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have made progress in treating advanced Parkinson's disease using stem cell therapy. A phase 1 trial involved transplanting nerve cells derived from donated stem cells into the brains of 12 patients, resulting in improved dopamine production and noticeable symptom relief. Patients in the high-dose group reported an average of 2.7 hours of additional 'on time' each day, indicating periods of normal functioning with minimal symptoms. Due to the success of the phase 1 trial, the FDA has approved a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group scheduled for 2025.</p>

          <p>Recent signs suggest that the Chinese economy is improving, bolstered by the government's stimulus package implemented in September 2024. The change in policy direction acknowledges falling demand as a major problem, primarily driven by instability in the real estate market. To alleviate pressure on local governments, the central government has allowed them to expand debt financing, using long-term bonds to replace short-term debt and enhance the credit capacity of state-owned commercial banks. Stabilizing property and stock markets is seen as crucial to mitigating the slowdown in consumer spending, requiring local governments to purchase unsold residential buildings for guaranteed housing and state-owned institutions to buy back shares.</p>

          <p>Russia is leveraging Libya's infrastructure for human trafficking and smuggling to bolster its interests in the Mediterranean and exert influence over Europe. Russian entities, including the former Wagner Group, collaborate with Libyan factions to facilitate the movement of migrants from Asia and Africa towards Europe. This operation generates revenue for Russian and Libyan actors while also serving as a means of weaponizing migration to pressure the EU. Experts suggest that offering safe routes and thorough checks upon arrival could counteract these activities and undermine the business of smugglers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, questioning the current model where top college athletes are often drafted by struggling teams. Proposed solutions include flipping the draft order, implementing a draft lottery, waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier, and creating a salary pool system where teams negotiate with prospects based on a tiered budget. These alternatives aim to balance league parity with player agency, potentially leading to more competitive teams and greater control for players over their career paths. Each system has potential flaws but could address concerns about rewarding floundering franchises and limiting player choice.</p>
