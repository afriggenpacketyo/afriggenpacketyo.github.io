          <p>Donald Trump indicated he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his Asia tour, which includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Trump is scheduled to meet with Xi Jinping to discuss trade, Taiwan, and Russia. Officials have downplayed the possibility of a Trump-Kim meeting, despite South Korea's reunification minister suggesting a considerable chance. Trump's Asia trip also includes signing a trade deal with Malaysia and overseeing a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, with global markets watching for progress on the trade war with China. The trip will also include a meeting with Japan's first female prime minister. Optimism for diplomatic progress remains tentative. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, leading to questions about whether a week-long break affected their performance. Miguel Rojas suggested the team felt the velocity of pitches more acutely, but dismissed it as an excuse. Manager Dave Roberts also downplayed the layoff's impact, despite historical trends showing teams with such breaks losing previous World Series matchups. Pitcher Blake Snell, who had a longer break, acknowledged his need to improve. Despite the loss, the Dodgers have a chance to rebound in Game 2, returning to the routine that brought them to the World Series.</p>

          <p>Police are searching for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national and asylum seeker, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford after being jailed for 12 months for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl. Kebatu was meant to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed outrage, and an officer has been removed from duties while an investigation takes place. Kebatu boarded a London-bound train, prompting a multi-force effort to locate him. The incident has sparked political criticism, with concerns raised about public safety. </p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei faces political headwinds as the country prepares for parliamentary elections, with critics arguing his austerity measures are hurting the middle class and disadvantaged groups. Despite a significant drop in inflation, many small and medium-sized businesses have closed, and wages have declined. Milei's economic shock therapy, aimed at slashing state spending and addressing foreign debt, has led to impressive macroeconomic outcomes but has also caused hardship for poorer citizens. With corruption scandals and disillusionment among young voters, the election outcome remains uncertain. Milei has sought financial assistance from Donald Trump to bolster his political standing. </p>

Trump called it a "dirty play" and said he could play even dirtier. Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would be paused on Monday to resume trade talks, after claims that the ad misrepresented Reagan's views. Trump halted trade talks after the Reagan Presidential Foundation objected to the ad's use of Reagan's speech. The ad, which accurately quoted Reagan on the dangers of tariffs, was shown during the World Series game. </p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, just before early voting began. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on addressing the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement is a significant boost for Mamdani, a Democratic socialist. Republicans are expected to use Jeffries' endorsement in future campaign material. Mamdani's opponent, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, received an endorsement from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The Knicks sent Mamdani's campaign a cease-and-desist letter over an ad using the team's logo.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the US of "fabricating a war" after the US deployed the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier to the Caribbean. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region, sending warships, a nuclear submarine, and F-35 aircraft. The US says its actions are aimed at targeting drug traffickers, but Maduro claims the US is trying to destabilize his government. Experts question the legality of the US strikes, suggesting they are part of an intimidation campaign. The deployment marks a significant escalation in US military buildup in the region.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have requested a U.S. appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would dissolve their joint venture, which facilitates coordinated scheduling, pricing, and capacity for U.S.–Mexico flights. Aeromexico contends that it would incur substantial, unrecoverable costs if forced to unwind the agreement. Delta also argues that its flight operations will face severe disruptions. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) ordered the termination of the joint venture due to concerns about competition, citing an unfair advantage for Delta and Aeromexico. The airlines assert that the order relies on unsubstantiated and speculative reasoning. </p>
