            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after sources revealed he used a second Signal chat to discuss airstrikes in Yemen with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. This revelation has prompted strong reactions from Democratic senators like Tammy Duckworth, who called for his resignation, citing a threat to national security. Senator Jack Reed also expressed concerns about Hegseth's ability to maintain trust and called for an investigation by the Department of Defense's Office of the Inspector General. The incident raises questions about Hegseth's handling of classified information and adherence to military protocols.</p>

            <p>Prison officers in the UK are demanding that staff be given electric stun guns to protect themselves in dangerous jails. This demand follows an incident where Hashem Abedi, responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing, attacked officers at HMP Frankland. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for the tactical use of tasers and the implementation of American "Supermax"-style rules for high-risk inmates. The Ministry of Justice has announced a full, independent review of the incident and has suspended kitchen access for prisoners at the separation center.</p>

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke from a detention center in Texas after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked his deportation. Paredes claims he and others were forced to sign a paper stating they are part of the Tren de Aragua gang. Trump's homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller, responded by saying that Democrats are fighting to keep gang members in neighborhoods. Paredes' mother denies the allegations, stating her son is a devout Catholic and not a terrorist, and wishes for him to be sent to Venezuela, not El Salvador.</p>

            <p>China has warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, amidst escalating trade tensions. This warning comes as the Trump administration plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that China will not accept deals made at its expense and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also cautioned about the risk to all countries if international trade returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>

A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson responded to reports that Washington plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. The Trump administration has initiated tariff talks with trading partners, including a Japanese delegation that visited Washington last week and South Korea, which is set to start negotiations this week. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese imports, affecting other countries as well.</p>

            <p>An analysis of HBO's "The Last of Us" Season 2 reveals a shift in tone from building bonds in impossible circumstances to exploring how bonds can fracture. The article criticizes the extended sequence depicting Joel's death, arguing that it diminishes the shock by revealing Abby's motive too early. While some episodes include glimmers of ingenuity, the show's limited imagination becomes more glaring as it progresses, focusing on undiluted pain rather than a careful observation of animosity. The season explores the notion that violence is unavoidable, cyclical, and generational.</p>

Trump recently raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on U.S. goods.

            <p>Despite government promises to transform the childcare system in England, parents still face difficulties finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. The rollout of "free hours" has not been the panacea hoped for, with a widening gap between those eligible and those missing out. Experts are concerned that the challenge has been too great for successive governments to solve. While Labour pledges to create additional childcare places, the system remains heavily reliant on private nurseries facing increased operating costs.</p>

            <p>Gatwick Airport has retained its position as the UK's worst airport for flight delays, with departures averaging more than 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024. This is attributed to ongoing air traffic control (ATC) disruption. Birmingham Airport had the second poorest punctuality record, followed by Manchester Airport. Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance for the second year in a row. Gatwick attributes the delays to ATC restrictions in other parts of Europe and its own control tower.</p>

A Lifetime ISA offers 25% bonuses, while Yorkshire Building Society offers a £5,000 deposit mortgage. Shared ownership allows buying a share in a home, and an 'income boost' mortgage allows family members to increase borrowing amount. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Data shows that men go to the doctors less than women, and are less likely to be registered at a dental practice or use a pharmacy. A survey indicates that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" when it comes to health issues, and talking about health concerns might make them appear weak. Experts say that society associates masculinity with self-reliance, independence, and not showing vulnerability. As a result, men often delay seeking help until symptoms interfere with daily function.</p>

            <p>India's roads are among the world's deadliest, with over 172,000 people losing their lives in 2023. The crisis is rooted in poor infrastructure, human behavior, enforcement gaps, and systemic neglect. Over-speeding, lack of basic safety precautions, overloading, and driving without a valid license are major causes. Poor civil engineering practices, flawed road design, and substandard construction also contribute to the high accident rate. The economic burden of road crashes costs India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>
