          <p>Beijing has defended its new export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies as a legitimate measure to safeguard national and global stability. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated the controls are not an export ban and that compliant applications will be approved, aiming to limit supply chain impact. This move comes just before a potential meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping, escalating trade tensions as the U.S. has already announced retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has asserted that Prime Minister Starmer's national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The case was dropped after prosecutors claimed the government failed to provide necessary evidence designating China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. Conservatives are now demanding an explanation and questioning Powell's role, suggesting he should resign if responsible for the decision.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's Mayor Gong Zheng has announced that the city will remove all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing sector. This move aims to grant overseas companies full market access in key fields such as electric vehicles, biotechnology, and value-added telecommunications. The policy is part of a broader effort to deepen institutional reforms and enhance Shanghai's openness, with the mayor also promising that foreign-funded manufacturers will be treated equally in government procurement processes.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the ethical dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues. The author suggests that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, acknowledging both the positive messages of tolerance in the books and their noted flaws. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article advocates for critically engaging with the material in a community to foster discussion and generate social good, thereby transforming a passive experience into a more active and ethical one.</p>

          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are reportedly exploring the sale of portions of the government's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to private investors. This unprecedented move could shift repayment responsibilities to private entities, raising concerns among borrower advocates about the potential loss of consumer protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the possibility of loan forgiveness. The proposal aligns with the administration's goals of reducing the federal government's role in student lending and potentially dismantling the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>Despite recent increases in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Chicago, organizers and residents remain optimistic about the city's annual marathon. The race route passes through diverse neighborhoods, including the predominantly Latino area of Pilsen, where community groups have been educating residents on their rights. While the fear of raids has reportedly kept some runners from participating in group events, local business owners and community leaders are encouraging people to celebrate the event as a show of resistance and solidarity.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, President Trump has announced that his administration has identified funds to ensure military service members receive their pay on October 15th. The president stated he directed the Secretary of War to use all available funds, with a Pentagon official indicating that about $8 billion in research and development funds could be used for this purpose. The move addresses a key political pressure point in the shutdown impasse, as 1.3 million active-duty troops were facing the prospect of a missed paycheck.</p>

The AI was able to analyze complex 3D protein structures, going beyond traditional methods that focus on simple sequence similarities. This approach helped identify hidden relationships in proteins that evolved separately but serve similar functions, such as echolocation in bats and dolphins, providing new insights into the genetic basis of this evolutionary process.</p>
