          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app reportedly used by President Trump's former national security advisor, has temporarily suspended its services due to a potential security breach. Smarsh, the parent company, is investigating the incident with an external cybersecurity firm. The app, similar to Signal, was reportedly open on Mike Waltz's phone during a Cabinet meeting, despite Trump's previous discouragement of Signal use following a leak controversy. The article notes that all other Smarsh products remain operational during this suspension. Optimism Score: 75</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport temporarily lost communication with aircraft, leading to significant delays and cancellations.
