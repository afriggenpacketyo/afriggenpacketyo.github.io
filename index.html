          <p>A federal judge is expected to issue an order soon regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws. California's Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta filed an emergency request to block the deployment, calling it an "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization." The judge acknowledged the significance and urgency of the issues. The state argues the deployment exceeds federal authority and is an overreach of executive power, while the Justice Department maintains the president acted within his powers. Optimism is tempered by the seriousness of the legal and political conflict. </p>

The National Guard's role is limited to protection and temporary detainment, not law enforcement, and they can accompany ICE on missions.

          <p>Federal immigration authorities are conducting raids across California, apprehending individuals at homes and workplaces. These raids have targeted locations including churches, fields, and parking lots, leading to widespread fear and disruption. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to "liberate" Los Angeles during a press conference that was interrupted by the removal of California Senator Alex Padilla. Governor Newsom has criticized the administration's approach as "chasing hard-working people" and "snatching women and children off the streets." The rapid increase in ICE activity has created a climate of fear in the region. </p>

Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence in the town, while an anti-racism protest in west Belfast passed peacefully. Chief Constable Jon Boutcher condemned the violence as racist and targeted at ethnic minorities, adding that some families hid in attics and wardrobes for safety. </p>

          <p>Democratic Senators have proposed legislation to penalize El Salvador for alleged human rights abuses and collusion with the Trump administration related to the imprisonment of U.S. individuals. The bill targets President Bukele and other Salvadoran officials with property-blocking and visa sanctions. It also seeks to block U.S. funding to the Salvadoran government and oppose international financial assistance. This action follows the Trump administration's deportation of alleged gang members to a high-security prison in El Salvador.

          <p>A federal judge has expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's authority to federalize the National Guard in Los Angeles. The judge questioned whether the president followed the law before ordering the deployment. He contrasted the president's authority with that of a monarch. The case was brought by California against the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>The House has voted to cut spending, including funds for NPR and PBS. The package targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Republicans characterize the spending as wasteful, while Democrats say the cuts will hurt the United States' standing in the world. The Trump administration is employing a tool that allows the president to cancel previously approved funds. </p>
