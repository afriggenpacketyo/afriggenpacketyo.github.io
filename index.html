          <p>The Canadian government announced it has rescinded its planned digital services tax, a move aimed at restarting trade discussions with the United States. This decision came after President Donald Trump declared he was terminating all trade talks with Canada in response to the proposed tax, which would have primarily affected American technology firms. Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump have now agreed to resume negotiations. The goal is to reach a comprehensive trade arrangement by a new deadline of July 21, 2025, signaling a de-escalation in the recent trade dispute between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's failure to provide significant support to its ally Iran during the recent conflict with Israel demonstrates its waning status as a global superpower. The author posits that Moscow's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has depleted its military and financial resources, crippling its ability to aid its allies effectively. Despite a strategic partnership and Iran's crucial military support for Russia's war effort, Moscow's response to attacks on Iran was limited to verbal condemnations and mediation offers. This inaction is presented as part of a larger pattern of strategic neglect, undermining Russia's credibility on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda, which includes significant spending increases for border security, defense, and energy. To offset these costs, the bill proposes cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office released an analysis estimating the legislation would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. Despite strong opposition from Democrats and concerns from some Republican holdouts about the bill's fiscal impact, GOP leadership is pushing to pass the measure before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

          <p>China's manufacturing activity continued to shrink in June for the third straight month, as indicated by the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) which registered at 49.7. While this is a slight improvement from May's 49.5, it remains below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion. The sector is struggling with a domestic price war, weak consumer demand, and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs, which have significantly reduced exports. Despite government stimulus efforts and pledges to boost domestic consumption, persistent deflationary pressures and falling industrial profits highlight the significant challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>Two elementary school teachers in Japan have been arrested for allegedly taking and sharing voyeuristic photos and videos of female students in a private social media group. The group, which included about eight other educators, circulated around 70 files, some of which appear to have been taken at school facilities using school equipment. The case has sparked significant public concern about child safety in schools and the trustworthiness of educators. This incident came to light during a separate investigation into another teacher in the chat group, prompting calls for stronger preventative measures and oversight within the education system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are linking to the unique characteristics of EV operation. Studies indicate that the smooth, rapid acceleration and the distinct deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems can provoke queasiness. Regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, creates low-frequency deceleration patterns that are a key trigger for motion sickness symptoms. This article explores the science behind this issue and potential solutions being developed to enhance passenger comfort in the new era of transportation.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that followed intense criticism from former President Trump. The announcement came after Tillis opposed Trump's major spending and tax bill, citing concerns over devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In response, Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented that leaders willing to embrace bipartisanship and compromise are becoming an "endangered species" in Washington, highlighting the growing partisan gridlock and political pressure that influenced his choice to leave the Senate.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy, Oscar Omar Hernandez, who was allegedly murdered by his youth soccer coach, died from acute alcohol intoxication, according to his family's attorney. The finding raises new questions about the circumstances leading to the seventh-grader's death while he was visiting the coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino. Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with a special circumstance of committing the act during lewd acts with a child.

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear capabilities but did not completely destroy them. His assessment contradicts more forceful claims from U.S. officials that the program was "obliterated." Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild its program if it chooses to do so. He also raised concerns about the location of Iran's enriched uranium, noting it's logical to presume it may have been moved as a protective measure, highlighting the urgent need for inspectors to regain access.</p>

          <p>The League of Social Democrats, considered the last functioning pro-democracy party in Hong Kong, has announced its dissolution. The party cited "immense political pressure" as the reason for its decision, which effectively marks the end of the city's organized pro-democracy political bloc. This development comes just before the fifth anniversary of the implementation of Beijing's national security law, which has been widely criticized for eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and civil liberties.

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The decision to resume imports follows an agreement reached in May between the two Asian nations to begin the necessary procedures for restarting trade. While the ban has been lifted, it is expected to take a few months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of Japanese seafood to China can fully resume.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Treasury Committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) needs reform, as its current structure can cause some savers to lose money. The LISA, designed to help those under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus, imposes a penalty for early withdrawals. This penalty effectively results in a 6.25% loss of the individual's own savings. The committee highlighted a surge in penalty-incurring withdrawals and criticized the product as overly complex and potentially unsuitable for people who might also claim benefits.

          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, has stated that the United States must guarantee there will be no further military attacks before Tehran will agree to resume diplomatic negotiations. In an interview with the BBC, he said that while the U.S. has signaled a desire to return to talks, it has not clarified its position on potential future strikes. Takht-Ravanchi also insisted on Iran's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting the notion of zero enrichment as "the law of the jungle." He emphasized that Iran is seeking clarity on whether it will face aggression while engaging in dialogue.</p>
