            <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to threats to withhold federal funding, alleging that the administration is attempting to exert unlawful control over academic decision-making. The lawsuit argues that the funding freeze, which includes $2.2 billion in grants and potential cuts of an additional $1 billion for medical research, violates the First Amendment and other federal laws. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university will not surrender its independence or constitutional rights, emphasizing the severe consequences of the funding freeze on research programs and the standing of American higher education. The Trump administration has also cut funding to other universities, citing concerns about antisemitism and diversity policies, however, Harvard is the first to explicitly challenge the government's demands in court.</p>

            <p>CBS News reports that Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for "viewpoint diversity." Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants.</p>

            <p>DW reports that Harvard University is suing the Trump administration to halt the freeze of over $2 billion in federal grants. The administration is demanding a range of concessions from the university, including stopping policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and banning campus protests. Harvard President Alan Garber has pushed back on those demands, stating that the university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The Trump administration has criticized top universities for not doing enough to stop antisemitism.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Department of Education announced that it will resume "involuntary collections" on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5, ending a pause that began in March 2020. Collections will be made through the Treasury Offset Program, potentially reducing tax refunds, Social Security benefits, and other government payments. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should no longer be responsible for irresponsible student loan policies, referring to the Biden administration's attempts to wipe away debt. Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with another 4 million facing late-stage delinquency, highlighting the scope of the issue after the pandemic-era payment pause expired.</p>

            <p>ABC News reports that the stock market is continuing its downward slide as the world reacts to the tariff policies of President Donald Trump. The president's criticisms of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also continued Monday as Trump said he should lower interest rates. A recent CNBC poll found that a small majority of American adults, 57%, disapprove of his tariff policy and 60% disapprove of his handling of inflation and the cost of living.</p>

            <p>President Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates immediately, leading to market instability. Trump's remarks followed the Federal Reserve's decision to hold steady on interest rates due to persistent inflation, contrasting with the European Central Bank's rate cut. The President's statements have sparked concerns about the Fed's independence, historically a crucial factor in maintaining economic stability and investor confidence. Wall Street analysts have expressed worries that political interference could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite, and Nasdaq all experienced significant losses following Trump's comments.</p>

            <p>ABC News reports that Joe Kasper, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s chief of staff, is moving to a new role working on special projects at the Pentagon, according to a senior defense official. This is the latest in a number of staff changes at the Pentagon. Three close advisers to Hegseth were pushed out last week amid allegations of leaking to the media, which they denied in a joint statement. A fourth senior staffer, John Ullyot, said he resigned from the Pentagon, suggesting the building has devolved into “total chaos.”</p>

The prosecution argued that Menendez was an essential part of her husband's corrupt activities, facilitating the acceptance of bribes on his behalf. Evidence presented during the trial included over $100,000 worth of gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash found at the couple's home during an FBI search.

This consideration follows Trump's executive order declaring an emergency at the border, despite border crossings reaching a quarter-century low. The Insurrection Act has been invoked sparingly throughout American history, including during the Civil War and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, granting presidents broad authority in mobilizing military personnel for domestic operations.</p>

            <p>Amazon has delayed some commitments around new data center leases, according to Wells Fargo analysts, signaling that economic concerns may be impacting tech companies' spending plans. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by Microsoft, which is also slowing down or temporarily holding off on advancing early build-outs. The cloud infrastructure providers have been aggressively announcing plans to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars securing Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and building new data centers. The analysts noted that the positioning is similar to what they've heard recently from MSFT, in that both companies are reeling in some new projects but not canceling signed deals.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, has been convicted on all 15 counts in her bribery trial, adding another chapter to the couple's legal troubles. She faces sentencing on June 12, having been found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors benefiting the government of Egypt. The case involved allegations of accepting lavish bribes, including gold bars and cash, with prosecutors arguing that Menendez and her husband placed their own interests ahead of the citizens he was elected to serve. The former senator had resigned from his U.S. Senate seat weeks after being found guilty of accepting lavish bribes, including gold bars and cash.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations is facing a legal challenge in federal court in Denver, with immigrant rights groups arguing that the government is providing insufficient notice to those facing deportation. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network contend that 24 hours' notice is not reasonable for individuals detained at the Aurora detention facility, especially those who may not speak English or have legal representation. The case raises concerns about due process rights for migrants and the potential for erosion of civil liberties.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating credit card debt can be a valuable strategy for many borrowers, but it's not a silver bullet. Rolling debts into a lower-rate loan can result in significant savings over time and simplify financial management. The effectiveness of debt consolidation largely depends on an individual's credit profile, with those having good to excellent credit likely to qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. However, it's crucial to address any underlying spending issues to avoid accumulating new debt.</p>
