        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a higher open, mirroring Wall Street's positive close, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a potential easing of monetary policy next month. Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, suggested that while inflation remains a concern, the deceleration in hiring is prompting the central bank to consider rate cuts. This outlook has fueled investor optimism, with futures for major Asian indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng pointing to a stronger start. The market's reaction reflects a significant shift in the economic calculus, moving away from previous hawkish expectations.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump publicly rejected Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to visit Baltimore for a public safety walk, instead demanding that Moore "clean up this crime disaster." Trump further threatened to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, linking it to the state's crime rates. Moore criticized Trump's rhetoric as "purely performative," citing a 20% decrease in homicides statewide since his inauguration and emphasizing the need for federal law enforcement resources, not National Guard deployments. This article highlights a heated political exchange over crime policy and federal intervention.</p>

          <p>A contingent of National Guard members in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, began carrying service weapons on Sunday night, marking an escalation in President Trump's law enforcement intervention. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses earlier guidance that troops would remain unarmed, despite local police data showing a decline in violent crime in D.C. The troops, initially tasked with protecting landmarks and crowd control, are now authorized to use force as a last resort against imminent threats. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have deemed the initiative unnecessary and unpopular among residents.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency as the state's infant mortality rate reached its highest level in over a decade, with 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average. Leading causes include congenital malformations and premature birth, with Black infants disproportionately affected. The declaration aims to expand prenatal services, create regional obstetric care, and strengthen community health programs. Experts emphasize that structural inequities like poverty and lack of continuous healthcare for mothers are key drivers, highlighting the need for comprehensive solutions beyond clinical interventions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers broke out of a two-month offensive slump with an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, tying them for first place in the National League West. Manager Dave Roberts sought a balance between disciplined at-bats and the team's natural slugging ability, which was delivered by Dalton Rushing's three-run homer and Freddie Freeman's two long balls in a five-run seventh inning. This win followed two low-scoring losses and demonstrated a renewed team-first approach at the plate. The article highlights the team's ability to adjust and capitalize on opportunities when it mattered most.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, argues that AI-powered autonomous weapons are the future of warfare, emphasizing their potential to reduce human risk in conflict zones. Luckey asserts that current U.S. military technology is outdated compared to civilian AI, leading Anduril to develop systems like the Roadrunner drone and the Fury unmanned fighter jet, which can identify and engage targets without constant human control. While acknowledging concerns about "killer robots," Luckey insists all Anduril weapons have a "kill switch" and believes these advancements will ultimately deter adversaries.

          <p>A legislative battle in California pits the legal cannabis industry against child care advocates over a proposed bill to reduce the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15%. This cut would slash $180 million annually from state revenue, directly impacting funding for child care, law enforcement, and youth services, including subsidized slots for 8,000 low-income children. The cannabis industry argues the tax increase is unsustainable amidst declining sales and competition from the illicit market.
