          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center after ignoring multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials. Representative LaMonica McIver, who witnessed the arrest, disputed the charges, stating that Baraka left the facility after being asked and was then arrested off the property. The arrest occurred during an oversight visit to the ICE facility, sparking accusations of political motivations behind the incident. Baraka's actions were part of a larger protest against the facility's role in President Trump's deportation policies.</p>

Katz's meticulous attention to detail and artistic temperament often pushed deadlines, but his ambitious work earned him praise from comic book legends like Will Eisner and Jerry Siegel. Despite facing commercial strictures early in his career, Katz's dedication to his unique vision solidified his legacy in the comic book world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus, which protects individuals from unlawful detention by the government. Miller's comments followed a question about using this measure to address illegal immigration, arguing that the Constitution allows suspension during an invasion. This reflects the administration's view of undocumented migrants as an "invasion," and the decision hinges on whether the courts align with the administration's deportation efforts. The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in U.S. history, primarily during times of rebellion or invasion.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to steep tariffs imposed by President Trump, making it costly for U.S. retailers to import goods. The tariffs, reaching up to 145%, prompted China to retaliate with 125% levies on American goods, resulting in a 21% decrease in shipments from China to the U.S. However, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, showcasing the trade pattern shifts caused by the tariffs. Trump indicated potential reductions to 80% ahead of trade negotiations, but businesses continue to re-evaluate supply chains amid the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has touted the new trade pact with the U.K. as a "maxed out deal," but experts suggest it may not be as beneficial as it appears, particularly because a 10% tariff remains on U.K. imports. This baseline levy, part of Trump's broader trade strategy, is significantly higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate of 3%. While some relief may be provided, businesses could still face higher costs and consumers may experience price increases, potentially leading to economic slowdown. The deal with Britain is viewed as a modest improvement, but uncertainty over tariffs continues to pose risks.</p>

          <p>Analysts and former government officials anticipate that the upcoming meeting between top U.S. and Chinese officials in Switzerland is unlikely to produce a significant breakthrough in the ongoing trade war. The talks, involving Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are expected to focus on frameworks and setting boundaries rather than a definitive deal. Each side has its own objectives, with the U.S. seeking a deal to ease market pressure and China hoping for tariff concessions. President Trump has hinted at potentially reducing tariffs, but significant challenges remain.</p>

Levchin defends the 0% loan strategy as a means to attract customers and gain market share from credit cards, emphasizing customer loyalty over immediate margins.

          <p>The Pentagon has directed military leaders to remove and review library materials related to diversity, anti-racism, and gender issues within two weeks, marking the latest effort to purge DEI content from federal agencies. Military leaders must identify and sequester materials potentially incompatible with the core mission, using search terms like "affirmative action," "anti-racism," and "gender identity." The order aims to ensure instructional materials are mission-focused and do not promote divisive concepts. Several military institutions have already received similar orders, including the Naval Academy, which removed books on the Holocaust, feminism, and civil rights.</p>
