          <p>The abbot of the renowned Shaolin Temple, Shi Yongxin, is under criminal investigation for multiple allegations including embezzlement and improper personal relationships. China's Buddhist association has officially stripped him of his monastic status, condemning his actions as severely damaging to Buddhism's reputation. Known as the "CEO monk" for his efforts to commercialize the temple, Shi had been cleared of similar charges in 2015, but this new probe is drawing significant public attention and could destroy his reputation if he is found guilty of corruption.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Alibaba is entering the smart glasses market with its new Quark AI Glasses, slated for a 2025 launch in China. The device will be powered by the company's Qwen large language model and integrate with its existing ecosystem of services like Alipay and Taobao. This move positions Alibaba as a direct competitor to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and fellow Chinese company Xiaomi, highlighting the growing industry focus on wearable technology as the next major computing platform.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, which it has labeled as "grotesque" compared to other public sector awards. This sets the stage for a potential formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government does not re-enter negotiations over the summer. While the government insists it cannot increase the headline pay offer, it remains open to discussing broader pay structure reforms and working conditions with the union to avert industrial action.</p>

Authorities believe heavy rainfall caused a nearby sewage shaft to overflow, triggering a landslide that obstructed the tracks and led to the crash. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his condolences, and an investigation into the precise cause is now underway, with the rail line remaining closed for cleanup and recovery operations.</p>
