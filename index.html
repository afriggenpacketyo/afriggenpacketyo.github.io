          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to auto tariffs, now estimating a $2 billion net impact from these trade policies. The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, though its new earnings guidance is lower than pre-tariff projections. The company highlighted ongoing 'constructive conversations' with the administration regarding the tariffs on steel and aluminum. Ford's electric vehicle division, 'Model e,' reported a significant loss, while its 'Pro' commercial business was identified as a primary growth engine.</p>

Robert Violante, who was blinded in the attack that killed his first date, Stacy Moskowitz, described the life-altering impact of the shooting and his subsequent journey of resilience. Another survivor, Carl Denaro, recalled being shot months earlier, an attack that was only later connected to the serial killer. Both men expressed relief at Berkowitz's capture, which ended his year-long reign of terror over New York City in 1977.</p>

          <p>The Secretary of the Army has ordered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to withdraw a leadership offer made to Jen Easterly, a former Biden administration appointee. Easterly, who previously directed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was slated to hold a distinguished chair position. The decision follows scrutiny over alleged government pressure on technology companies to censor speech during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Army Secretary also mandated a top-down review of West Point's hiring practices and paused involvement from outside groups in employee selection.</p>

          <p>A jury in Colorado has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela Craig, by lacing her protein shakes with arsenic. The prosecution presented evidence of Craig's incriminating internet searches, such as 'how to make murder look like a heart attack.' He was also convicted on several other charges, including solicitation to commit murder, for attempting to hire a fellow inmate to kill an investigator on his case. A first-degree murder conviction in Colorado carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>A recent study analyzing vehicle resale values found that a car's color significantly impacts its depreciation over time. According to the research, blue cars lose the most value, depreciating by an average of 27.1% over five years. Black and red cars also see substantial value loss, while silver holds its value slightly better. The study identified white as the most financially stable color, with vehicles losing only 18% of their value on average, making it the slowest depreciating popular color among the top models analyzed.</p>

          <p>Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, 22, is a top target for several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United and Newcastle United, with a potential transfer fee around £70 million. Often compared to Erling Haaland, the tall and athletic Slovenian international is recognized for his goal-scoring ability, speed, and all-around play. Despite a strong record in the Bundesliga and Champions League, his high price tag may be a barrier for some clubs. The article suggests that while a move is possible, Sesko might also benefit from another season at Leipzig to continue his development.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, has announced she will not run for governor of California. Her decision ends months of speculation and opens up the field for the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom. In her statement, Harris indicated that her future in public service would not be in elected office 'for now' but vowed to remain politically engaged. Her absence from the race dramatically reshapes the contest to lead the nation's most populous state, which now features a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it 'risks rewarding terror.' The hostage, Doron Katz-Asher, stated on social media that such a move sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy and undermines genuine peace efforts. Her comments echo concerns from lawyers representing British families of hostages, who fear the UK's approach could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining captives. Starmer announced the plan citing the 'intolerable situation' in Gaza.</p>

          <p>With borrowing costs remaining high, homeowners are exploring home equity loans and HELOCs as more affordable options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of late July 2025, average interest rates for home equity loans range from 8.25% to 8.40%, while the average HELOC rate is around 8.26%. The article explains the key differences between the two products, noting that home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, whereas HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit. It also reminds homeowners of the risks involved, as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High Noon has issued a nationwide recall for some of its Beach Variety 12-packs of vodka seltzer after discovering they may contain cans of Celsius energy drink. The Celsius-branded cans were accidentally filled with High Noon's alcoholic beverage due to a packaging supplier error. This mistake poses a health and safety risk, as consumers could unknowingly ingest alcohol. The affected products were shipped in late July to retailers in several states, and the company is urging customers to dispose of the mislabeled cans and seek a refund.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has revealed that the Army helicopter involved in a fatal mid-air collision over Washington D.C. had a faulty altimeter. This malfunction caused the helicopter to fly significantly higher than intended, with discrepancies of up to 130 feet, placing it in the path of an American Airlines flight. All 67 people on both aircraft were killed in the January crash. The hearing also highlighted concerns about insufficient vertical separation distances in the flight paths approved for helicopters and planes around the busy Reagan National airport.</p>

          <p>A New York woman has pleaded guilty to her role in a $30 million investment scam that defrauded foreign nationals by selling them access to a 2017 fundraiser with President Trump. The scheme falsely promised investors that their money, put into a fictitious development project, would also guarantee them permanent U.S. residency. The perpetrators charged foreign nationals $93,000 each to attend the event, then illegally used the foreign-sourced money to make a $600,000 contribution to the hosting committee. The Trump campaign was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case.</p>

          <p>Leading humanitarian organizations have declared that the 'worst-case scenario' of famine is now occurring in Gaza, describing it as one of the world's most intense hunger crises. The situation has deteriorated sharply, with a majority of malnutrition-related deaths in 2025 happening in July. Aid groups blame a breakdown in the delivery system, insufficient access, and the ongoing conflict for the catastrophe. While Israel has instituted some 'humanitarian pauses,' aid organizations say the measures are inadequate and are calling for unimpeded access to prevent further widespread starvation and death.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the Department of Justice has disclosed that the grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell investigations contain testimony from only two witnesses: an FBI agent and an NYPD detective. The filing, part of the DOJ's effort to unseal the records, reveals that no alleged victims testified directly before the grand juries that indicted the pair. This information comes as the Trump administration pushes for the release of the documents to provide public transparency while aiming to protect the rights of the victims involved in the case.</p>

          <p>One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, an 8.8 magnitude tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, has generated tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. Tsunami warnings and advisories were issued for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and several countries in South America. While the most severe warnings for the U.S. have been downgraded, officials caution that a tsunami is a series of waves and the danger may persist for hours. Evacuations took place in coastal areas of Hawaii and Japan, with minor flooding and small to moderate waves reported so far.</p>
