          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless the country makes 'substantial' concessions, particularly opening up its markets to U.S. businesses and products. Speaking to the media aboard Air Force One, Trump emphasized his desire for China to allow greater access for American companies to sell their goods and services within China. He expressed uncertainty about even requesting such openness, suggesting China may be unwilling to agree to it.</p>

          <p>World leaders are converging in Rome for Pope Francis's funeral, presenting an opportunity for informal diplomatic exchanges.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 02:58:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's actions against the media, including barring reporters and attempting to defund organizations like Voice of America (VOA) and National Public Radio (NPR), are raising concerns about press freedom. While some outlets have successfully fought back in court, experts warn that the First Amendment requires active defense. There are fears that intimidation tactics could discourage legal challenges to free speech violations. The administration's moves are seen as part of a broader strategy to control the public narrative, potentially leading to increased misinformation and undermining democratic stability.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' and 'sex' as biological. The guidance states that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals and schools, and vice versa for transgender men. It suggests providing mixed-sex facilities where possible, or individual lockable rooms. A consultation period will follow to seek feedback from stakeholders before a final code of practice is submitted to the government.</p>

          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that motion sickness symptoms may be prevented by listening to a minute of specific sound. The research indicates that a 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, helping to reduce motion sickness by improving balance. This preventive measure offers a potential alternative to current methods largely limited to medication.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders experienced a significant drop in the NFL Draft, falling from a projected top-five pick to being passed over by multiple teams in the initial rounds. Despite the unexpected slide, Sanders expressed confidence on social media. Reports surfaced earlier in the week suggesting some coaches viewed him as 'entitled' and 'not that good,' potentially contributing to his draft position. His eventual landing spot remains uncertain as the draft progresses into its later rounds.</p>
