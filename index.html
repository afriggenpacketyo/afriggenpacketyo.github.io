          <p>Karol Nawrocki, backed by the previous right-wing governing party, has been elected as Poland's president, creating challenges for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's liberal agenda. Nawrocki's victory signals a setback for the centrist government, potentially leading to political gridlock. His presidential power of veto may hinder Tusk's efforts to advance his policies, particularly those related to EU integration and judicial reform. The election outcome reflects a shift in Poland's political landscape, with implications for the country's relationship with the European Union. Optimism is tempered by the potential for political conflict and policy stagnation.</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning to visit the United States for a fifth round of ministerial-level talks, aiming to find common ground before a summit between the two countries' leaders.

Other news includes former yokozuna Hakuho's expected retirement announcement, defense tech subsidies for Japanese universities totaling 2.7 billion yen, and a Japanese whaling ship returning after taking 25 fin whales in the Sea of Okhotsk.
