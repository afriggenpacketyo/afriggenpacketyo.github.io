          <p>Four Russian nationals are on trial in Hamburg, Germany, accused of being members of a foreign criminal organization and supporting the extremist group Islamic State (IS). The suspects allegedly collected around ‚Ç¨174,000 through social networks to send to IS members held in camps in Syria. German authorities consider Islamist extremism a serious security threat, though far-right violence has increased. The trial highlights the ongoing concern about the funding of terrorism and the increasing number of individuals from Russia or the Caucasus region involved in IS activities in Germany.</p>

          <p>Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the reality TV show ‚ÄúDuck Dynasty‚Äù and founder of the Duck Commander business, has died at the age of 79. Robertson, who had early-stage Alzheimer's and other health problems, created the duck-call business that became a reality television empire for his family. ‚ÄúDuck Dynasty,‚Äù which ran for 11 seasons, centered on the Duck Commander business and the family's unique brand of humor. The show occasionally courted controversy, including a brief suspension of Robertson after he made statements that were widely seen as offensive to gay people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing the 'first sale rule,' a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a transaction, potentially stripping out the cost associated with a middleman's profit. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. The first sale rule is considered particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming, the 'Su Hai No 1,' in June, signaling a push to reduce reliance on imported seafood through offshore aquaculture. The vessel, costing 600 million yuan (US$83.6 million), is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional systems, the ship can relocate to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security amidst global challenges.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, controlled by Nicol√°s Maduro loyalists, claimed an overwhelming victory in regional and legislative elections, despite sparsely populated polling places. The results, announced without evidence, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governorship of Zulia. The electoral council claimed a turnout higher than 40 percent, but independent observers were absent, and results were not posted online. Some Venezuelans suggested the low turnout signaled loyalty to opposition leader Mar√≠a Corina Machado, who had called for abstention.</p>

Despite condemnation, Israeli authorities appear to draw strength from the criticism, reinforcing a sense of isolation.

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep enables the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research reveals how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to 'repair mode,' prompting restorative slumber. This discovery offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases, opening pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>U.S. futures experienced a jump, while Asian shares mostly declined following President Donald Trump's decision to delay a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened the tariffs due to stalled trade talks with the EU. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures both saw gains, while Asian markets showed mixed results.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, following the failed launch of a new navy warship, with the accident damaging parts of the vessel's bottom. Kim Jong Un called the incident a 'criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism'. The 5,000-ton destroyer, Pyongyang's second known naval destroyer, is now undergoing repairs. The incident is considered an embarrassing setback for Kim's efforts to strengthen North Korea's naval forces.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares to vote for a new president, many women feel their priorities, such as safety and fairness, are being sidelined.

With the economy struggling, many young men feel victimized by reverse discrimination and are resistant to feminist agendas. Neither the leading candidate, Lee Jae-myung, nor his main rival, Kim Moon-soo, are prioritizing women's issues, leaving many women feeling that nothing will change regardless of the election's outcome.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to reach approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system and involves major retailers, such as supermarkets, to enhance government influence over prices. The decision follows criticism of the government's ineffectiveness in curbing rising rice prices amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice, covering transportation costs to regional areas, with online sales also under consideration.</p>
