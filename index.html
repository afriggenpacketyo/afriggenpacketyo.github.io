          <p>President Trump signed an order to enact parts of a trade agreement between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars exported to the US. The agreement, reached last month, aims to protect British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs, although a 10% levy remains on most UK goods, including cars, and does not eliminate charges on steel imports. The UK has been granted a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion liters of US ethanol, potentially impacting UK bioethanol producers, and the UK will scrap a 20% tariff on US beef imports, raising the quota to 13,000 tonnes, while maintaining food safety standards. This move is seen as a sign of strength between the two nations and a reassurance to the UK car manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy was rescued after drifting at sea for five hours on a paddleboard when typhoon Wutip struck Hainan province in southern China.

Emergency services were alerted, and a search and rescue operation was launched, eventually locating the boy and bringing him safely back to shore.

          <p>Israel has claimed responsibility for killing an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. Separately, at least 45 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured by Israeli forces near an aid distribution site in Khan Younis, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry and a local hospital. Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli drones and tanks fired at citizens who were heading to the distribution center. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), supported by Israel and the US, has been distributing aid since last month, as an alternative to UN and NGO assistance, which Israel alleges has been misappropriated by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court rejected an attempt to revive a copyright trial concerning Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," bringing an end to a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," in which it holds a copyright interest, but the court sided with earlier rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the copyright trials had been a constant source of stress. The case centered on similarities in chord patterns, but the court agreed the progression was too commonplace to be legally protected.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's actions in the Middle East, particularly his approach to the Iran-Israel conflict, have dominated international events, showcasing what some analysts describe as "masterful ambiguity." According to analysts in Israel, Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu tacit approval to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate over its nuclear weapons program within a 60-day window. Trump has maintained a strategic ambiguity regarding his role, offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans. This approach is compared to the "masterful inactivity" of Sir John Lawrence, a British governor general and Viceroy of India.</p>

          <p>The US immigration system is described as a flawed system that exploits individuals for profit, leading to protests and calls for reform. The system, which evolved from early xenophobic and racist laws, has been manipulated by multinational corporations to suppress wages and increase profits. Agreements like NAFTA and laws like the IIRIRA have created an imbalance between labor and capital, trapping workers and making them vulnerable to exploitation. Taxpayers subsidize this system, spending billions on border security measures that divide communities and separate families, all while multinational corporations continue to move freely around the world.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs indicate that China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence as regulatory restrictions are lifted to facilitate technological advancements and international expansion. Investment patterns suggest a renewal led by capital expenditure, aggressive overseas expansion plans, R&D spending, and increased fundraising. The private sector, accounting for a significant portion of China's GDP and employment, faced challenges during strict pandemic restrictions and regulatory crackdowns. Beijing's support for the private sector signals a shift towards internal economic momentum amid intensifying economic rivalry with the United States.</p>
