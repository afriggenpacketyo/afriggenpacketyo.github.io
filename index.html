          <p>Kevin Federline's new memoir, "You Thought You Knew," offers a critical portrayal of his ex-wife, pop star Britney Spears. The article highlights Federline's allegations of erratic behavior during their marriage, including substance use during pregnancy and a concerning incident with a knife. He also expresses support for the past conservatorship and ongoing worries for Spears's well-being. Spears has denounced the book as "extremely hurtful" and a profit-seeking endeavor, defending her relationship with her sons and accusing Federline of attempting to undermine her public image.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical minerals and rare earths agreement, envisioning projects worth up to $8.5 billion. The pact includes a planned $1 billion investment from both nations over six months, though a White House fact sheet cited over $3 billion. This framework aims to establish a supply chain independent of China, which currently dominates rare earths processing. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will also provide over $2.2 billion in financing, with a Pentagon investment planned for a gallium refinery in Western Australia, bolstering strategic resource security.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey's legal team has filed motions to dismiss his two-count federal indictment, alleging vindictive and unlawful prosecution. His attorneys argue the charges stem from an "egregious abuse of power," ordered by President Trump due to "personal spite" and Comey's past criticisms. The defense also challenges the appointment of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan. A hearing on these motions is scheduled for November 19 in Alexandria, Virginia, marking a significant development in the ongoing legal battle.</p>

This unfortunate development follows his recent return to the show after an earlier absence caused by illness. Despite these challenges, Dennis and his professional partner, Dianne Buswell, had achieved their highest score of the series in their last performance. The 66-year-old expressed deep gratitude for the opportunity, hoping to eventually dance with his wife once he fully recovers from his injury.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate "non-crime hate incidents," shifting focus to matters meeting the threshold for criminal investigations. This policy change aims to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity, following concerns about policing "toxic culture war debates." The announcement coincided with the Met dropping its probe into Father Ted creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence in X posts, a case that sparked public backlash and free speech debates. Linehan and the Free Speech Union plan to sue the Met for wrongful arrest.</p>

Finally, rigidly adhering to the "1% refinancing rule" can be a misstep, as even smaller rate differences can yield significant savings, provided closing costs are recouped.

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has led to furloughs at the National Nuclear Security Administration, impacting approximately 1,400 employees responsible for the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Energy Secretary Chris Wright criticized the "Schumer shutdown," highlighting the critical nature of these workers. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would administer the oath of office to Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva only after the government reopens, resisting calls to swear her in sooner. Federal courts also face funding cuts, with staff performing limited tasks unpaid or furloughed, underscoring the widespread impact of the prolonged legislative impasse.</p>

          <p>With a near 99% likelihood of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut by October 29, savers are advised to consider opening specific Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts now. While top CD rates have decreased from recent highs, they still offer better returns than traditional savings accounts. Examples include a $10,000 6-month CD at 4.20% for quick returns, an 18-month CD at 4.05% for extended financial protection, and a $5,000 3-year CD at 3.95% for guaranteed long-term growth. Prompt action is crucial as banks may lower rates even before the official Fed announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth companies surged on Monday as investors reacted to Chinese export restrictions and the U.S. government's industrial policy aimed at building a domestic supply chain.

Companies like NioCorp, Energy Fuels, and USA Rare Earth saw significant gains, with analysts anticipating further government backing for miners.

          <p>President Trump's critical minerals pact with Australia is seen as a strategic prelude to his highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in South Korea. The Australia deal, promising at least $1 billion in financing for extraction and processing, aims to "de-risk" the global economy from China's rare earth "extortion." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent "frank and detailed" meeting with Chinese counterparts also sets the stage. Trump has expressed hope for a "good deal" with China, yet maintains the threat of 100% additional tariffs if Beijing doesn't yield on trade issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A leaked group chat among Young Republican leaders, containing antisemitic slurs and Nazi sympathies, has ignited a debate within the American right about a deeper problem of bigotry. Critics argue that leading conservative figures have normalized such rhetoric by overlooking it, with Vice President JD Vance dismissing the chat as "college group chat" comments. The incident highlights a culture where extreme statements are seen as "cool" and a growing divide over whether to draw a line against extremists. This trend is exacerbated by some right-wing influencers mainstreaming conspiracy theories and anti-Israel commentary.</p>

Among the stolen treasures are Empress Eugénie's Pearl and Diamond Tiara, the Grand Corsage Bow brooch, sapphire pieces from Queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense, an emerald necklace and earrings from Empress Marie-Louise, and a diamond-encrusted brooch.
