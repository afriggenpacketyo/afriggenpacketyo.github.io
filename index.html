          <p>An industrial accident at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant near Pittsburgh has resulted in at least one fatality and ten injuries, with one employee still missing. The incident, which involved multiple explosions at the facility's coke oven batteries, prompted a large-scale emergency response from numerous local agencies. While the plant has since been stabilized and a stay-at-home order for nearby residents was lifted, a search and rescue operation remains active for the unaccounted-for worker. U.S. Steel has stated its priority is safety and is cooperating with authorities to investigate the cause of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>President Trump's position on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has shifted dramatically, calling him a 'success' after a meeting, just days following a public call for his resignation. The meeting, which included cabinet members, was described by Trump as 'very interesting,' and he indicated that Tan would be providing suggestions to the administration. This change in tone comes after criticism from Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to China, which had prompted Trump's initial demand. The development reflects the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry, particularly concerning U.S.-China competition.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the temporary federalization of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department and the deployment of the D.C. National Guard. This executive action places the city's police under federal control for up to 30 days and brings at least 800 Guard members onto the streets, with threats of similar deployments in other major cities. The administration cites rising crime as the reason, a claim disputed by data showing a significant decline in violent crime in the district since its 2023 peak. While the move is technically within presidential authority regarding D.C., it raises concerns given past uses of federal forces against protesters.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, becoming the fifth named storm of the current hurricane season. Located west of the Cabo Verde islands, the storm is expected to move west and intensify, with forecasts suggesting it could become the first hurricane of the season later in the week. Early models project Erin could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean, though it poses no immediate threat to the United States. The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs until November, is predicted to be above-normal, with a higher-than-average number of named storms and hurricanes expected.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, director Martin Scorsese revealed the extreme lengths he considered to protect his 1976 film 'Taxi Driver' from studio-mandated cuts. Faced with pressure from Columbia Pictures to remove bloody scenes, an angered Scorsese contemplated getting a gun to threaten executives. He also considered stealing the rough cut to prevent the studio from what he felt would be its destruction. Ultimately, a compromise was reached with the Motion Picture Association of America, as suggested by Steven Spielberg, to desaturate the color in the violent sequences, which preserved the film's integrity without requiring any edits to the content.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a major pivot in its electric vehicle strategy, planning to retool its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a midsize electric pickup truck priced around $30,000. This move represents a shift towards affordability, aiming to compete with gasoline-powered trucks and undercutting the price of current EVs on the market. The plan involves a $5 billion investment and aims to make the vehicle profitable, a challenge Ford has faced with its F-150 Lightning. Despite headwinds from changing government policies, Ford sees developing competitively priced EVs as essential to compete with Chinese automakers on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

Her decision comes two years after she led a lengthy and successful strike, securing gains in pay and AI protections. Actors Sean Astin and Chuck Slavin are now vying to lead the union as it confronts challenges like a difficult job market, the expansion of AI, and upcoming contract negotiations. Drescher, who was reelected with 81% of the vote during the 2023 strike, was a fiery and prominent face for the union's fight against major studios.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, this article provides a guide for consumers on how to negotiate directly with creditors for relief. The first step is preparation: gathering financial documents and creating a budget to demonstrate a serious intent to resolve the debt. Consumers should understand their options, which can range from temporary hardship programs that lower interest rates to debt settlements where a lump-sum payment is made for less than the total balance. When contacting creditors, it's crucial to be polite but firm, and to get any new agreement in writing before making a payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity reached a new record of $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with the average homeowner holding $213,000 in accessible value. This surge provides a significant financial resource for those coping with high borrowing costs and inflation. Homeowners can access this wealth through several methods, including a fixed-rate home equity loan for a lump-sum payment or a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC) for a flexible credit line. For seniors, a reverse mortgage offers a way to borrow equity without the burden of monthly repayments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline from this week to mid-November. The move, formalized through an executive order, was an expected outcome of recent trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in Stockholm. Without the extension, U.S. duties on Chinese goods would have reverted to their peak levels of 145%. This delay is the latest instance of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused or altered, creating uncertainty for businesses involved in international trade.

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies surged on Monday following reports that Chinese battery giant CATL has suspended production at its Yichun Project mine. The suspension was due to an expired permit, and the company is working to renew it. This mine is a significant global supplier, accounting for about 4% of the world's forecasted lithium production for 2025. The news prompted a rally in stocks like U.S.-based Albemarle, which jumped 7%, as investors anticipate that the supply disruption will lead to an increase in global lithium prices amid an already tightening market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research on a recent major earthquake in Myanmar, which occurred on a fault similar to California's San Andreas, suggests the next 'Big One' may not resemble past events. A study co-authored by Caltech scientists found that the Myanmar quake ruptured a much longer section of its fault than expected, indicating that earthquakes do not necessarily repeat in predictable patterns. This implies that California's next major seismic event could be different from the historic 1906 or 1857 quakes, potentially rupturing a larger or smaller segment of the fault. The findings underscore the complexity of earthquake behavior and the need to prepare for a wide range of possible scenarios.</p>

The company expects revenue to be significantly lower than the same period last year, a performance CEO Thomas Siebel called 'completely unacceptable.'

This article calculates the potential interest earned on a $50,000 deposit with today's top rates, showing substantial returns. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% would yield $2,200 in interest, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could earn over $11,000. Because CD rates are fixed upon opening and accounts are FDIC-insured, they provide a reliable alternative for savers who prefer to avoid the volatility of the stock market while still achieving significant growth on their money.

CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering box office, a 26% increase in attendance, and record-high revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the U.S. Supreme Court is the primary entity to blame for the current political crisis surrounding partisan gerrymandering in states like Texas. The author points to the 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause, where the court's 5-4 majority ruled that challenges to partisan gerrymandering were a 'nonjusticiable political question' for federal courts. This ruling, the article contends, effectively gave a green light to practices that allow representatives to choose their voters, undermining democracy. The piece concludes that by refusing to intervene, the court has created a situation where the only response to one party's gerrymandering is for the other to retaliate in kind.</p>
