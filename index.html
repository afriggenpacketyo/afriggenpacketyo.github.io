          <p>The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program remains uncertain as Congressional Republicans indicate they are waiting for direction from President Trump before negotiating a permanent legislative solution. Despite some bipartisan support for protecting DACA recipients, the political coalition has weakened, and the administration's current focus is on border enforcement and mass deportation efforts. Lawmakers who previously supported a pathway to legal status now defer to the White House to initiate talks, leaving the fate of around half a million program beneficiaries in limbo.</p>

          <p>Increasingly unaffordable housing is driving a trend where friends and relatives are pooling their resources to buy homes together. This approach helps overcome significant financial hurdles, particularly for single individuals who face a market dominated by single-family homes designed for dual-income households. While co-buying expands purchasing power, it also introduces complexities, necessitating clear legal agreements to manage shared ownership, potential disagreements, and future exit strategies. This shift reflects broader economic pressures and changing social norms around homeownership and community living.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive aerial assault on Ukraine, involving nearly 500 drones and over 40 missiles, targeting Kyiv and six other regions. The bombardment, which lasted for hours, resulted in the deaths of at least four people in the capital, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured dozens more across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as "vile" and vowed that Ukraine would retaliate, highlighting the assault's timing at the close of the UN General Assembly week.</p>

He emphasized China's vibrant, competitive, and entrepreneurial high-tech environment, driven by a deep talent pool and strong work ethic. Huang argued that to maintain its geopolitical influence and economic success, the U.S. technology industry must be allowed to compete globally, including within the Chinese market, to proliferate its technology and stay ahead.</p>

          <p>Moldovans are voting in a critical parliamentary election that will determine whether the country aligns more closely with the European Union or with Russia. The election is marked by high tensions, with pro-EU President Maia Sandu accusing the Kremlin of "massive interference" and attempting to destabilize the nation. Ahead of the vote, Moldovan authorities disqualified two pro-Russian parties for using illegal foreign funding, highlighting the intense geopolitical struggle for influence over the former Soviet republic.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses these issues by ensuring the system is entirely managed by public entities and that personal data is stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the optional e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy erosion despite the new safeguards.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed a sweeping set of sanctions on Iran through the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. Triggered by the UK, France, and Germany due to Iran's continued nuclear escalation, the sanctions freeze assets, halt arms deals, and penalize its missile program. This action intensifies an already severe economic crisis within Iran, where citizens are facing record-low currency values, soaring food prices, and growing anxiety about the nation's future and the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>This article explores Newcastle United's current struggles with converting set-piece opportunities into goals, despite having a physically tall team and hiring a specialist coach. Manager Eddie Howe has acknowledged that this element of their game is not functioning effectively, noting that it has cost them in recent matches.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's TikTok Deal May Represent a Strategic Victory for China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 01:09:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, brokered by the Trump administration, may not effectively address national security concerns and could be a strategic win for China. The author points out that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, will retain a significant stake, remaining the single largest shareholder in the new U.S. entity. This arrangement, the article contends, leaves China with considerable leverage over the platform, potentially undermining the core objective of securing American user data and algorithms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article pushes back against the Trump administration's recent controversial claims about autism by celebrating traits often associated with autistic people. The author highlights characteristics such as an intense capacity for focus, a strong adherence to facts, deep empathy, and a powerful sense of social justice. The piece argues that these qualities, which stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump's public behavior, are valuable and should be recognized, reframing autism not as a tragedy but as a different way of being with unique strengths.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking steps to acknowledge a violent episode in its history by dedicating a new monument to the 28 Chinese miners who were killed by a mob in 1885. This public commemoration, along with an archaeological dig at the site of the former Chinatown, represents a significant effort to confront its anti-immigrant past. The move is set against the complex backdrop of current national and local crackdowns on immigration, creating a moment of historical reflection amid contemporary tensions.</p>

          <h2>Weak Consumer Demand in China Leads to Lower Hairy Crab Prices Ahead of Holiday</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of China's 'golden week' holiday, the price of hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy, has fallen due to weak consumer spending and higher-than-usual production. This price drop is being watched as a key indicator of the health of domestic consumption in the country's slowing economy. The overlapping of the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays creates an extended break, making this period a critical test for retail, travel, and dining sectors.</p>
