          <p>Israel launched a series of strikes against Iran, targeting what it claims are locations related to Iran's nuclear program, which they see as an existential threat. Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency following the strikes, anticipating a potential missile and drone attack from Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the operation would continue until the threat is removed, citing Iran's progress towards weaponizing enriched uranium. The strikes have heightened tensions in the region, with Iranian officials vowing to retaliate, and the United States clarifying that it was not involved in the operation, emphasizing its priority to protect American forces. Optimism surrounding the geopolitical situation is low.</p>

          <p>Israel's military conducted preemptive airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists, initiating what could be a multi-day operation called "Operation Rising Lion."

Iranian state television reported the deaths of key Iranian military figures, including Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, further escalating tensions. The United States has stated it was not involved in the operation, emphasizing its focus on protecting American forces in the region, while Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, promised a harsh response to Israel.

          <p>Tensions have been growing between Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump regarding a potential Israeli attack on Iran, with Trump advising Israel to wait while the U.S. continues nuclear negotiations. Israel, however, felt compelled to act, believing Iran to be at its weakest point following the degradation of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement distancing the U.S. from the "unilateral action" taken by Israel, but acknowledged Israel's claim that the attack was necessary for self-defense. The White House is publicly separating itself from the military action, attempting to avoid direct involvement in the conflict for the moment, but this has increased global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>According to a World Gold Council expert, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The expert notes that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which typically hedges against market volatility. He argues that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the marketing of cryptocurrencies as "gold 2.0" as a fallacy. The comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. (not investment advice) The financial outlook seems mixed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused a court order that would have required President Trump to return control of the California National Guard troops in Los Angeles to Gov.

The original order from U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer stated that Trump's actions were illegal, exceeding his authority and violating the 10th Amendment.

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized by the Israeli government as a "preemptive" strike to remove the source of a threat, but this is questionable. While preemptive attacks are considered justifiable in international law when thwarting an imminent attack, the Israeli action appears to be a preventive war, which carries greater moral and practical risks. The Israelis claim the Iranian nuclear program required immediate action, while critics suggest the goal might be regime change. This decision is laden with immense danger, particularly due to the potential for escalation and the lack of finality in war. This has caused global panic.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily halted a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said the Trump administration can deploy the National Guard to L.A. while the court considers the administration's appeal, and ordered a hearing for June 17. The lower court judge had found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize members of the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, and granted their request to block his use of the forces to assist immigration agents during raids. The situation has created instability.</p>

          <p>Michael Madigan, the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history, is expected to be sentenced on federal bribery, conspiracy, and wire fraud convictions. Madigan was convicted on 10 of 23 counts in a corruption trial tied to a scheme to push legislation in exchange for jobs and contracts for his associates. Federal prosecutors are seeking a 12 1/2-year prison term, while Madigan's attorneys are seeking probation, arguing the government's sentence would condemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny. The court has received numerous letters of support for Madigan, while prosecutors argue that his criminal activity spanned nearly a decade and involved efforts to enrich himself.

          <p>North Korea stated that it has successfully repaired and relaunched a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged in a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended a ceremony at the Rajin shipyard to mark the achievement, revealing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. The destroyer had tipped over during the initial launch attempt, causing damage, and Kim ordered it to be repaired before a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026. This has increased global tensions.</p>
