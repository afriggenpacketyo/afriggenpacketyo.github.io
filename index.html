          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny for his handling of the military operation in Yemen, particularly his sharing of sensitive details on unsecured channels. The operation, aimed at stopping Houthi attacks on commercial ships, has escalated into a costly and potentially expansive conflict. The U.S. military's efforts, involving aircraft carrier strike groups and airstrikes, have already cost billions, while failing to establish air dominance. A deadly bombing raid that killed dozens and the downing of U.S. drones highlight the challenges and risks of the ongoing campaign.</p>

          <p>The Governor of the Bank of Korea, Rhee Chang Yong, has expressed concerns that escalating trade tensions, particularly those stemming from U.S. tariffs, are negatively impacting the South Korean economy and the global economic landscape. Rhee highlighted that these tensions are creating headwinds for South Korea, affecting its semiconductor production in Vietnam, car and electronics production in Mexico, and battery production in Canada. His comments come as South Korea's GDP contracted for the first time since 2020, adding to the economic uncertainty in the region.</p>

Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law was hired in exchange for the airline's CEO leading a state-funded agency, with his salary and housing support considered bribes intended for Moon. This indictment is part of a series of prosecutions against officials from Moon's administration, raising concerns about politicization within the South Korean prosecution service.

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted for the first time in four years, declining 0.1% year-on-year in the first quarter, primarily due to a sharp fall in construction activity. This contraction, which missed expectations, is attributed to domestic political uncertainty and rising global trade tensions. The Bank of Korea had already warned of weaker-than-expected economic growth and is expected to implement further rate cuts. Political instability, including the impeachment trials of former President Yoon Suk Yeol and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, has contributed to the economic downturn.</p>

Efforts are underway to promote more neutral language, such as "undocumented immigrants," to reduce prejudice and discrimination against those without legal residency status.
