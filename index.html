          <p>Russian forces launched attacks across Ukraine, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, just hours after peace talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian officials reported that numerous drones were launched, and impacts were recorded in several locations, with the highest casualties occurring in the northeastern regions. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate acts against civilians, stating that Putin has no genuine interest in peace. The peace talks, brokered by the U.S., aimed to establish a ceasefire and address prisoner exchanges and the return of Ukrainian children, but Russia's demands included Ukrainian withdrawal from claimed regions and limitations on its armed forces.</p>

          <p>Political maneuvering intensifies in Japan as ruling party officials suggest Prime Minister Ishiba might dissolve parliament for an election amid a potential no-confidence motion. Tensions have risen after Ishiba hinted at dissolving the House of Representatives, prompting the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) to consider whether to submit a no-confidence motion. Ishiba's minority government is currently struggling with rising rice prices and attempting to negotiate trade tariffs with the U.S. While the junior coalition partner rejects holding elections for both houses, the prime minister's decision rests solely with him.</p>

          <p>Indian women are increasingly navigating the disturbing impact of the manosphere, including incel culture and misogyny, on their lives. The manosphere consists of online communities that can devolve into anti-feminist rhetoric, the dehumanization of women, self-loathing, and even violence. Experts warn that incel ideology and other manosphere ideas are becoming more mainstream in India, with Indian influencers adopting similar rhetoric.

Deficit hawks like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are pushing for deeper cuts than those in the House-passed bill, potentially complicating its passage in the Senate. While the bill reduces outlays by over $1.5 trillion, it still adds about $3.1 trillion to the debt, leading to clashes with the White House. The Senate is expected to alter the House proposal, but any changes must be approved by the House, where the bill narrowly passed.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the increasing privatization of public services in the United States suggests a shift towards a neo-feudalistic system, where power and governance are decentralized and held in private hands. This trend, accelerated by deregulation and outsourcing, leads to independent fiefdoms and a concentration of power among a small group of wealthy individuals. The article examines examples such as private military companies, private security forces, and the privatization of law and oversight. The author questions whether this is a temporary aberration or the default setting of human society.</p>

          <p>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is set to testify in a defamation trial brought by a former Dominion Voting Systems employee.

Lindell, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, has repeatedly asserted that the election was rigged, claims widely debunked.
