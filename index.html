          <p>Tennessee National Guard units are mobilizing in Memphis, authorized by Governor Bill Lee, for an anti-crime deployment that contrasts with contested federal deployments elsewhere. The 150 Guardsmen will join a task force comprising 13 federal and state agencies, including the Memphis Police Department. This article notes that while Memphis has seen a steady drop in crime, the deployment is part of a broader Trump administration initiative. The Guardsmen will support violent crime enforcement without patrolling or making arrests, with enforcing federal immigration law also listed as a priority for the task force.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed new California laws to regulate puppy sales and enhance buyer protections, stemming from an investigation into deceptive breeding practices. The legislation bans online marketplaces for dog brokers and voids pet purchase contracts requiring nonrefundable deposits. This article highlights that sellers must now disclose breeder details and medical history, with health certificates made public. The laws aim to close loopholes that emerged after a 2019 pet store sales ban, combating unregulated markets and shielding consumers from fraudulent puppy mill operations, ensuring greater transparency in pet purchases.</p>

          <p>The "Asean plus three" group, including China, Japan, and South Korea, achieved solid economic growth in the first half of 2025, with a projected 4.1% growth for the year, an upward revision. Despite this resilience, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) warns that trade policy uncertainties, particularly from unpredictable U.S. policy shifts, remain "high." This article highlights that the U.S. has imposed tariffs ranging from 15% to 40% on several ASEAN+3 members. While growth defies expectations, the region remains cautious about potential tremors from global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters and advocates are issuing urgent public safety warnings due to a troubling increase in fires in trash bins, garbage trucks, and waste facilities. This article attributes the rise to the "vape effect," where lithium-ion batteries from improperly discarded vaping devices ignite, causing a record number of incidents in the U.S. and Canada. These fires threaten waste workers, disrupt recycling, and can release heavy metals. Authorities urge proper disposal of battery-containing devices at specialized drop-off sites, promoting the campaign "Skip the Bin, Turn Your Batteries In" to mitigate these significant risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Democratic-led cities is facing significant legal challenges, with judges hearing arguments in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois. A federal judge in Illinois partially blocked the deployment, citing the administration's "unreliable" assessments of local events. This article highlights local leaders' arguments that using military on civilian streets is unconstitutional and could escalate civil unrest. The White House defends the deployments as within the president's legal authority to address illegal immigration and crime, but the courts are scrutinizing the justification and potential impact on communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, ruling Kendrick Lamar's lyrics in the diss track "Not Like Us" were opinion, not objective facts. The lawsuit alleged UMG published and promoted the Grammy-winning track despite its false accusations of sexual assault against Drake and calls for vigilante justice. This article highlights the judge's reasoning that a "reasonable listener" understands a diss track is not a factual investigation. UMG praised the dismissal, while Drake's spokesperson stated an intent to appeal the ruling.</p>
