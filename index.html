          <p>An administration official stated that President Trump is providing a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran, emphasizing that Trump is not seeking war but wants Iran to reconsider its stance. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iranâ€™s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication, though no meetings are planned. European diplomats are scheduled to meet with Araghchi in Geneva, but some U.S. officials are skeptical of European efforts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long opposed negotiating with Iran, but the U.S. does not necessarily defer to Israel's views on the matter. The article presents the current diplomatic landscape amidst ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Iran.</p>

          <p>A United Nations report indicates that approximately 123 million people worldwide have been displaced from their homes due to conflict, persecution, and other threats as of the end of 2024. The report tracks refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons, revealing a significant increase in displacement since 2015. Most displaced individuals remain within their countries of origin, with Africa and the Middle East hosting the largest proportion of internally displaced populations. The report also highlights that a small number of countries account for the majority of refugees, who often seek shelter in neighboring nations, with developing countries disproportionately hosting refugees.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in London have discovered a large collection of painted Roman wall plaster at "The Liberty" development site, offering insights into ancient Londinium. The fragments, discarded during Roman-era demolition before A.D. 200, have been meticulously reassembled by the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). The artworks feature bright yellow and black panel designs adorned with birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres, with influences from other parts of the Roman Empire. The find includes what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain and ancient graffiti, including a complete Greek alphabet. The research into each plaster piece is ongoing, with plans for eventual public display.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates reflects on his father's battle with Alzheimer's and expresses optimism about progress in fighting the disease. He highlights breakthroughs in blood-based diagnostic tests that can detect amyloid plaques in the brain, potentially enabling earlier detection and intervention. Gates also notes the FDA approval of two drugs, Lecanemab and Donanemab, which modestly slow the disease's progression, with increased funding for research being crucial. Gates emphasizes that early diagnosis paired with new treatments offers hope, marking a shift from when Alzheimer's was considered a "death sentence."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are being sold for a record $10 billion to an investment group led by Mark Walter, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, indicating a shift in sports ownership. The sale highlights how sports teams have become too valuable for individual billionaires or families to solely control. The Buss family, who owned the Lakers since 1979, sold a majority stake to Walter's group, reflecting a trend where institutional investors are increasingly involved in sports team ownership. This transition raises questions about accountability and potential exploitation of teams, though the Lakers' strong market position suggests continued success.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the dominant theory that birds sing at dawn due to favorable acoustic transmission conditions. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found no evidence supporting the idea that sound travels farther or more clearly at dawn. The study suggests that the dawn chorus is more related to birds marking territory after nighttime inactivity and communicating about food resources. While the study does not definitively explain the dawn chorus, it rules out environmental factors as the primary cause, highlighting the complexity of bird vocal behavior.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly regarding rare earth minerals, long before China's recent export restrictions. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan has diversified its rare earth sources, investing heavily in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% from over 90%. While Japan is better prepared than most countries, it still faces challenges in cutting dependency, especially for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the ongoing complexities of escaping China's mineral dominance.</p>

          <p>Amid repeated missile attacks, Israelis are contemplating the implications of the conflict with Iran on the ongoing war in Gaza and the fate of hostages. While most missiles are intercepted, some have caused damage and casualties, leading to heightened anxiety and disrupted routines. There is widespread support among Jewish Israelis for military action against Iran, with many viewing Prime Minister Netanyahu as a guarantor of security. However, some critics express concerns about the potential for escalation and the impact on efforts to resolve the conflict in Gaza and secure the release of hostages.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto gave up three runs over 6-1/3 innings and was charged with the loss as the San Diego Padres avoided a four-game series sweep by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 on Thursday. Yamamoto (6-6) surrendered a solo home run to Xander Bogaerts in the second inning and gave up one run apiece in the fifth and the seventh at Dodger Stadium. The home team went behind 5-0 before rallying for all three of their runs in the bottom of the ninth. Tensions that had simmered between the division rivals throughout the series boiled over late in the game, with both benches clearing after Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit by a pitch from Dodgers reliever Jack Little in the top of the ninth.</p>

          <p>A robotics laboratory at the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT) in central Chinaâ€™s Hunan province has developed a mosquito-sized drone for covert military operations. NUDT researchers showed their work on various types of robots â€“ from humanoid machines to tiny drones barely visible to the eye â€“ in a report aired on CCTV 7, China Central Televisionâ€™s military channel, on the weekend. The report highlighting advances in robotics engineering also showed a prototype controlled via smartphone with four wings, two moving horizontally on each side of the body. Their tiny size makes manufacturing this new type of drone challenging: sensors, power devices, control circuits and other elements must fit into a very small space.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant decline in May, with sales volumes dropping by 2.7%, the largest monthly fall since December 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the decline to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, particularly in alcohol and tobacco sales, as consumers cut back on spending. Separate figures revealed an increase in government borrowing, reaching the second-highest level for May since 1993. While sales volumes in the three months to May were up by 0.8%, economists suggest that the initial burst of economic growth may be over.</p>

The shift in many cities toward more progressive governance has been a bitter defeat for the right, leading to caricatures of urban life and leaders. While cities have elements that might appeal to conservatives, the chaotic and intolerant nature of populist politics makes a return to urban conservatism less likely.</p>
