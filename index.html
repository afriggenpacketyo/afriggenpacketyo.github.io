            <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein, both originating from China, have announced they will be raising prices for US consumers starting next week, citing increased operating expenses due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs imposed by President Trump. The companies, known for their ultra-low prices, have faced challenges due to the 145% tariff on most products made in China and the end of a customs exemption for goods under US$800. The price adjustments will take effect on April 25, but the specific size of the increases has not been disclosed. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione has been indicted on federal charges, including murder through the use of a firearm, in connection with the killing of UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signaled her intention to pursue the death penalty, aligning with President Trump's agenda to combat violent crime. The defense argues that Bondi's statement was improper and prejudiced the grand jury process, while Mangione also faces state charges related to the shooting, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The killing occurred as Thompson was heading to an investors' conference in Midtown Manhattan.</p>

Kanter emphasized that Google's illegal monopoly has harmed the advertising ecosystem, leading to overcharging and underpayment for news publishers and content providers.

While HHS denies these plans, some FDA employees have been working on this shift for years, potentially freeing up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine inspections to states, but higher-risk inspections and foreign facility inspections would likely remain with the FDA. Some states and advocacy groups have supported this move, arguing that states can often conduct inspections at a lower cost while meeting the same standards.</p>

            <p>Thieves tunneled through multiple reinforced walls to steal an estimated $10 million in gold and jewels from Love Jewels, Reina de Oro, in downtown Los Angeles. The burglars deactivated the security alarm and cut camera feeds before clearing display cases. The family-owned business is offering a $100,000 reward for the recovery of the merchandise, which was uninsured and represented the family's life savings. The FBI's major theft task force is assisting with the investigation.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has started laying off staff as part of a restructuring effort under the Trump Administration to reduce the bureau's size and scope. The layoffs follow a recent court ruling that cleared the way for the agency to send reduction-in-force notices. The agency's chief legal officer outlined a new direction, emphasizing state enforcement and supervision activities, and shifting focus back to banks and depository institutions while deprioritizing areas like medical debt and digital payments. Consumer organizations have criticized the reorientation as a significant retrenchment in the CFPB's mission.</p>

The IRS has the authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, but doing so for a university like Harvard would be unprecedented. While Trump cannot legally order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, the IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy. Experts believe Harvard would likely win any court case and maintain its tax-exempt status.</p>
