          <p>Former President Trump has publicly stated his intention to use an upcoming summit in Alaska to directly assess Russian President Vladimir Putin's readiness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump predicted he would know "probably in the first two minutes" if a deal is feasible, adding that any potential agreement would likely involve "some land-swapping," which has raised concerns among Ukrainian and European leaders. Assuring he would consult with allies, Trump is preparing for this first face-to-face meeting with Putin since 2019, viewing it as a critical opportunity to broker a resolution.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Colorado are confronting two massive wildfires, with over 1,000 personnel deployed to battle the blazes amidst extremely challenging conditions of high winds and severe drought. The Lee fire, sparked by lightning, has rapidly grown into the fifth largest single fire in the state's history, scorching over 130,000 acres with only 7% containment. In response to the growing threat, which has forced evacuations in multiple counties and generated hazardous air quality, Governor Jared Polis has officially declared a disaster emergency to mobilize state resources and support the ongoing response efforts across the affected regions.</p>

          <p>Citing a "public safety emergency," President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of placing Washington, D.C.'s metropolitan police force under federal control and deploying the National Guard. He announced that Attorney General Pam Bondi will command the police, with a stated mission to combat crime, clear homeless encampments, and restore order to the nation's capital. This action has been sharply criticized by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other local officials, who dispute the president's characterization of the city's crime situation by pointing to official data showing a significant year-to-date decrease in violent crime.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has firmly denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury materials from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case, stating the release would not reveal any consequential new information. In his ruling, Judge Paul Engelmayer noted that the documents, which consist of summary testimony from law enforcement, are redundant of evidence already made public during Maxwell's trial and do not identify any new co-conspirators or clients. The judge also sharply criticized the government's motion, suggesting it was a disingenuous "diversion" tactic aimed at creating the illusion of transparency rather than providing genuine public insight.</p>

          <p>Shares of enterprise AI company C3 AI plummeted by over 20% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results that CEO Thomas Siebel described as "completely unacceptable." The company expects significantly lower revenue and a much wider operating loss compared to the previous year. Siebel attributed the poor performance to a disruptive sales reorganization and his own ongoing health issues, which he said limited his active participation in the sales process. The news has shaken investor confidence as the company navigates this difficult period. (not investment advice)</p>

It identifies three key groups: retirees on fixed incomes who need to supplement their monthly budget, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash for emergencies, and individuals who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows these homeowners to borrow against their home's equity without incurring monthly payments, effectively converting a major asset into usable, tax-free funds.

          <p>The online retail landscape is on the verge of a seismic shift as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT move toward incorporating fully integrated checkout systems. This innovation would allow consumers to complete purchases directly within the AI chat interface, creating a more seamless and frictionless experience by eliminating the need to navigate to a separate merchant website. While this could disrupt existing payment processors, analysts suggest the larger impact may be on who controls the customer's initial product discovery journey, with AI assistants potentially becoming the new "homepage" for commerce and capturing billions in retail media revenue.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has officially formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean near the Cabo Verde islands. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center are monitoring the storm as it moves westward, reporting that conditions are favorable for it to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season. Early projection models indicate that Erin could intensify into a major hurricane by the time it nears the Caribbean islands toward the end of the week, although it does not currently pose an immediate threat to the United States.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning to President Trump, stating he will lead an effort to redraw his own state's congressional districts if Republican-led states like Texas proceed with their controversial redistricting plans. In a formal letter, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" and declared that California cannot stand idly by. He presented an ultimatum, offering to stand down only if Republican states call off their efforts, thereby escalating the national political conflict over gerrymandering ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including the U.S.-based company Albemarle, surged significantly on Monday following reports that a key lithium mine in China has suspended its production. The Yichun Project, which is operated by battery giant CATL, was forced to halt operations after its mining permit expired. This development temporarily removes a source that accounts for approximately 4% of the forecasted global lithium supply for 2025, leading investors to anticipate a sharp rise in lithium prices due to the immediate tightening of an already constrained market.

The parliamentarians were marching toward the Election Commission headquarters to voice their opposition to a large-scale revision of the electoral roll currently underway in the state of Bihar. Critics, including Gandhi, argue that this revision process could unfairly disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly those from the Muslim minority, ahead of crucial state elections later this year.</p>

          <p>A growing wellness trend, informally dubbed "cowmaxxing," has seen a surge in the popularity of cow-based products like beef-tallow moisturizer, raw milk, and supplements made from bovine organs. This movement, which is heavily promoted by online influencers and some public figures, taps into a powerful "naturalness bias," where unprocessed and ancestral products are perceived as inherently healthier than modern, conventional alternatives. While some of these products contain tangible nutrients, many of the health claims are unproven, and certain practices, such as consuming unpasteurized raw milk, carry significant and well-documented health risks.</p>
