          <h2>Trump Threatens Further Tariff Increases on China Amid Market Turmoil</h2>

          <p>Amidst ongoing market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariffs against U.S. trading partners, Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on China if they do not remove retaliatory tariffs. A senior White House official indicated this could bring the total tariff on some Chinese goods to 104%. Trump continues to claim, without providing evidence, that the U.S. is gaining billions from these tariffs, despite economists warning of potential recession risks due to increased costs and policy uncertainty. This escalation in trade tensions contributes to market instability and raises concerns about the future of U.S.-China trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to block the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that a federal court cannot compel the president to engage in foreign diplomacy to facilitate Garcia's return, alleging Garcia is a gang member. Lower courts had ordered Garcia's return, asserting the government lacked the authority to deport a person lawfully present in the U.S. without due process. The case raises constitutional questions about executive power and individual rights.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession.

While Trump touted the low oil prices, worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses and a slowdown in economic activity, ultimately hurting demand for oil.

          <p>Amid market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariff announcements, experts address questions about how stock market indices work and how market downturns affect pensions and daily life. Tariffs are generally unpopular in the US and could lead to increased prices for consumers and potential recession. While the situation is complex, American markets are more open to foreign goods than many foreign markets are to US goods, but it is American corporations that have strategically pursued shareholder value by moving production facilities to economically advantageous locations.

          <p>Dr. Peter Marks, former FDA vaccine chief, claims he was forced to resign after refusing to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a vaccine safety database. Marks feared the data might be manipulated or deleted. He says Kennedy is minimizing the use of vaccines in the country. Kennedy's team sought access to the VAERS database, but Marks would only allow read-only access. The HHS spokesperson said Kennedy has advocated for vaccination multiple times.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surpassed $3,000 per ounce, marking a significant milestone and impacting investor strategies.
