His work achieved its full effect in the play of light and shadow, and he continued to create these reliefs with force and precision even in his later years. His art is esteemed worldwide and in diverse cultures, stirring people's feelings with its humane character.

          <p>Shares of Inditex, the owner of Zara, experienced a decline after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to summer sales. The Spanish retailer's revenues for the fiscal first quarter were slightly below analysts' forecasts, and net income also fell short of expectations. The company cited broader economic uncertainty as a factor and noted that summer sales growth had slowed compared to the previous year. Inditex, which also owns brands like Pull & Bear and Bershka, is seen as an indicator of consumer sentiment, and the impact of tariffs on consumer spending remains unclear.

          <p>Asian countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging. ASEAN has committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment to reduce exchange rate fluctuations. The global share of the dollar in foreign exchange reserves has declined, and investors are recognizing that the dollar can be used as leverage in trade negotiations. This shift is driven by a desire to reduce foreign exchange risks and the potential weaponization of the dollar in trade and sanctions.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the historical context of Donald Trump's attacks on Harvard and other liberal arts colleges, tracing the animosity back to the 1970s when conservatives began criticizing universities for alleged left-leaning bias. The article references a book from 1978 titled 'Harvard Hates America' and Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership, highlighting a long-standing Republican ambition to subjugate institutions like Harvard. Trump's administration is implementing policies outlined in Project 2025, such as redirecting funding to trade schools and restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The author argues that these actions are part of a broader counter-revolution aimed at undermining universities for political gain.</p>

The skeletons, dating back to the Battle of Williamsburg in 1862, were found with their arms crossed and dressed in comfortable clothing rather than uniforms. Historians believe a makeshift hospital operated nearby to treat wounded Confederate soldiers, and researchers are working to identify the soldiers using hospital patient lists. The bodies were reinterred at a local burial ground with other Confederate soldiers, ensuring they receive dignity in death.</p>

Both countries aim to craft a mutually beneficial and balanced agreement, potentially including early wins, with a target to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion.

          <p>Thousands of people in Austria gathered for a candlelight vigil to mourn the ten victims of a school shooting in Graz, where a 21-year-old former student took his own life after the attack. Police found a "farewell letter" and a non-functional pipe bomb at the suspect's home, but the motive remains unconfirmed. The incident, which also injured twelve others, has led to three days of mourning in Austria, with a nationwide minute's silence observed. The school will remain closed until further notice, and Chancellor Christian Stocker has declared the shooting a "national tragedy".</p>

The vote comes after right-wing nationalist Karol Nawrocki, backed by the opposition Law and Justice party and US President Donald Trump, won the presidential election. Tusk has called for the vote to rally support for his pro-European coalition, which has struggled to deliver on key reforms due to opposition from the president.

The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with intellectual disabilities, mental illnesses, or hereditary disorders to prevent the birth of "inferior" offspring.

          <p>The Justice Department has issued a legal opinion stating that President Trump has the authority to abolish national monuments protecting historical and archaeological sites. This opinion reverses a 1938 determination that monuments created under the Antiquities Act cannot be revoked. The finding supports the administration's efforts to expand U.S. energy production by potentially altering protections for monuments. The opinion singles out two monuments designated by President Biden, suggesting they are incompatible with the protection of scientific or historical sites.</p>
