          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Canada for the G7 summit, preparing for discussions on global growth, trade disputes, and the Russia-Ukraine war. A key focus will be his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to address tariffs impacting Japan's export-driven economy, particularly on cars, auto parts, steel, and aluminum, as a House of Councillors election approaches. Ishiba intends to stress the importance of G7 unity in tackling global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific region where China's influence is growing. He also plans to explore potential talks with leaders from South Korea, Ukraine, and Australia, while the G7 is unlikely to issue a joint declaration, opting instead for documents on specific points.</p>

          <p>Amidst ongoing immigration raids in Southern California, anxiety and anger have surged, even as President Trump hinted at potentially easing workplace raids. ICE agents conducted a raid at a Santa Fe Springs swap meet, leading to the postponement of a scheduled concert and the detention of numerous individuals. Trump acknowledged concerns from farmers and hospitality businesses about labor shortages due to aggressive immigration policies, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the need for careful deportations to avoid disrupting the food supply. Protests erupted near SoFi Stadium, with demonstrators expressing solidarity with undocumented immigrants and denouncing Trump's policies, while a Koreatown-based non-profit launched a fundraising campaign to support street vendors affected by the raids, providing financial assistance to cover rent and other essential needs.</p>

          <p>This news digest covers several key events, including potential talks between Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba and U.S. President Trump at the G7 summit, focusing on tariff negotiations. It also notes that China's nuclear arsenal has increased to 600 warheads, raising concerns about a new nuclear arms race, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Additionally, Renault CEO Luca de Meo will step down in July, shifting attention to the company's relationship with Nissan, and the Bank of Japan may slow its reduction of government bond purchases. Japan has also requested that several countries block access to foreign-based online casinos for its residents, and a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant owner was arrested after food poisonings.</p>

          <p>Esraa Abo Qamar describes the dire situation in Gaza, where hunger is being used as a weapon of war and US-backed aid distribution points have become death traps. People weakened by hunger are walking long distances to these facilities, only to face chaotic scrambles for limited supplies and deadly fire from Israeli forces. The article recounts the tragic death of a twelve-year-old's mother who was shot while trying to get food for her family, and highlights the desperation and indignity faced by Gazans in their search for sustenance. The author contrasts this with the more structured and humane aid system previously offered by Unrwa, where food was distributed in an orderly and dignified manner through trusted community members.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary by the end of the century, impacting coastal cities in eastern Shandong province. As warmer weather causes upstream ice to break and drift downstream, it refreezes in colder areas, leading to ice jam formations. These localized hazards can cause destructive flooding and sudden releases of ice and water, damaging communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam flood dynamics, concluding that climate warming is shifting hotspots downstream despite a long-term decline in overall ice jam flood frequency.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking and racketeering case continued with testimony from "Jane," Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who described her relationship with him from 2021 to 2024. Jane claimed Diddy forced her into "hotel nights" involving sex with male escorts while he watched, but legal experts suggest her testimony could be seen as both helpful and harmful to the prosecution. Her account of Diddy's reaction to the public release of his attack on Cassie Ventura, and the alleged violence she experienced afterward, provided a comprehensive view of his behavior. However, her continued engagement with Diddy, even after the alleged incidents, could raise questions about her credibility and motives, especially as Diddy is still paying for her lawyer.</p>

This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions already followed by companies like TSMC and aims to tighten loopholes.

A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies, enhance implementation synergy, stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks in the property market. The meeting highlighted plans for a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the sector's decline and stabilize it amidst external economic turmoil.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government's ban on biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but current incinerator capacity is insufficient to handle the additional demand. This "capacity gap" will lead to Scottish councils and commercial waste companies negotiating contracts to landfill waste in England, raising concerns about increased emissions from transportation. While the long-term strategy is to reduce waste generation, domestic recycling rates have remained stagnant, and environmental groups fear that incinerator contracts will disincentivize further recycling efforts.</p>

          <p>CEOs from Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy are closely monitoring the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel but are refraining from making definitive predictions on oil prices. Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli stated that predicting oil prices is unreliable, while Woodside Energy CEO Meg O'Neill noted the significant impact of recent events on forward prices. Both executives acknowledged that geopolitical events closely influence oil and gas prices, with O'Neill citing historical examples dating back to World War II. Despite the potential for significant price effects if supplies through the Strait of Hormuz are disrupted, neither CEO would commit to a firm oil price forecast.</p>

          <p>Protesters in Barcelona, Mallorca, and other Spanish cities used water pistols against tourists to demonstrate against mass tourism, which they believe is exacerbating housing shortages and eroding local culture. The coordinated protests, also seen in Venice and Lisbon, reflect growing discontent with the impacts of overtourism on residents' lives. Protesters argue that rising rents, displacement of traditional businesses, and the dominance of tourist-oriented services are making it difficult for locals to afford housing and maintain their way of life. While some tourists laughed off the water attacks, others acknowledged the underlying concerns of residents feeling pushed out of their own communities.</p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik argues that Israel's actions, particularly in Gaza and its recent attacks on Iran, have damaged its reputation and strained relations with key allies. The author suggests that these actions are an attempt to regain lost credibility and recast Israel as a victim acting in good faith. However, the author questions the justification for these actions, pointing out the disproportionate response to threats and the use of conflict to bolster domestic support for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Malik concludes that Israel's approach treats the Middle East as a theater for domestic politics, disregarding the needs and concerns of other countries in the region.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's proposed "revenge tax" could deter foreign investment into the United States. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a provision allowing the U.S. to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. individuals and companies. This measure, targeting digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes, could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe-haven status. Goldman Sachs suggests that UK companies, particularly those with significant U.S. revenue exposure, might consider relisting in New York to avoid the tax, while UniCredit fears potential tax disputes could damage foreign investor sentiment.</p>
