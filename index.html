          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested following an incident in San Jose. He is suspected of intentionally crashing a vehicle into a U.S. Post Office, which then caught fire and was deemed a total loss by investigators. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service noted that the fire appeared to have been deliberately set, though a motive remains unclear. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to join the Army after 9/11 and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004, a fact the military initially concealed from his family.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition, composed of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, failed to secure a majority in the upper house parliamentary election. This loss, compounded by a previous defeat in the lower house, marks a significant political setback, largely attributed to public discontent over inflation and scandals. Despite the defeat, which often leads to resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to navigate critical trade negotiations with the United States. The election also saw a notable surge for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained momentum with its anti-immigration and "Japanese First" rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A man deliberately drove a car into a crowd of people waiting outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven in critical condition. Police identified the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, who allegedly made a U-turn before ramming into the crowd. Following the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and attacked him; he was also shot by an unknown assailant who then fled the scene. Ramirez has been booked for assault with a deadly weapon, while police are separately investigating the shooting. The incident prompted a massive emergency response, with 124 firefighters dispatched to the chaotic scene.</p>

          <p>Ecuadorian drug lord Adolfo "Fito" Macias, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, has been extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine trafficking and firearms smuggling. This marks the first time Ecuador has extradited one of its own citizens. Macias was recaptured in June after a high-profile escape from a maximum-security prison in January, which prompted Ecuador's president to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." Once a peaceful nation, Ecuador has become a key transit point in the global cocaine trade, with gangs like Los Choneros, linked to Mexican cartels, fueling widespread violence.</p>

          <p>Former Nickelodeon star Drake Bell has publicly claimed that the network does not pay residuals to its actors for shows like his popular sitcom "Drake & Josh." Bell stated that despite the show's continued popularity on streaming services and marathon reruns, he and his co-stars do not receive ongoing compensation, alleging the network uses exploitative contracts. This accusation comes in the wake of the "Quiet on Set" documentary, where Bell also detailed sexual abuse he suffered from a dialogue coach while working at the network. Bell described the situation as a corporation making billions from child labor while the actors struggle financially.</p>

          <p>A significant contrast in energy policy is emerging between the U.S. and China, particularly as the demand for electricity rises due to advancements in AI and other technologies. While China is aggressively pursuing renewable energy goals and increasing investment in the sector to gain a global tech advantage, the Trump administration is moving in the opposite direction. U.S. policy under Trump has focused on canceling tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable energy sources that compromise the nation's electric grid. This divergence highlights a key area of strategic competition between the two global powers.</p>

Health officials link the surge to rising vaccine hesitancy and misinformation that has become more prevalent since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts warn that low vaccination rates are the primary driver and that the virus will continue to spread until herd immunity is re-established through increased immunization.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be about 8% worse off annually than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. To address this looming shortfall, the government is reviving the Pensions Commission, which will bring together experts, unions, and employers to develop a new national strategy. The commission's goal is to build consensus on tackling the complex issues preventing adequate retirement savings.</p>

While Scheffler himself dismisses the parallels as premature, his peers and pundits point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like."

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's core scientific research arm. The move is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23% and is being framed by the administration as a way to streamline operations and focus on the agency's core mission. The ORD is responsible for analyzing a wide range of environmental hazards, from toxic chemicals to climate change. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, calling it a travesty that will cripple the EPA's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has begun giving audiences a friendly warning before the band's "Jumbotron Song," advising them to be prepared to appear on the large screens. This new practice follows a recent concert where the camera focused on a man and woman who appeared to be in an affair, an incident that quickly went viral online. The two individuals were later identified as the CEO and chief people officer of a tech company, leading to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by the company. The band has not directly addressed the viral moment, but the new on-stage warning serves as a tacit acknowledgment.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Advocates for Teaching 'Self-Connection' as a Child's Most Vital Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that the single most important skill to teach a child for a successful life is "self-connection"—the ability to tune into and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The expert suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, undermining their self-esteem. Fostering self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This strong sense of self is presented as a powerful buffer against anxiety and a foundation for lifelong mental health.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, stated that while an extension of the current 90-day pause on new tariffs between the two nations is almost inevitable, the business community remains concerned. He noted that discussions have been almost exclusively about tariffs, overlooking other critical issues impacting the trade relationship. Stein suggested that China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could create a path toward normalizing trade if the U.S. reciprocates by lowering related tariffs. However, he emphasized that the narrow focus on tariffs is a source of worry for the over 270 American companies his organization represents.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the ambitious goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. His model involves a $300-million investment fund that provides private equity to finance projects, which he believes will allow for faster and cheaper construction than the traditional government-subsidized system. By aiming for market-rate returns, Miller hopes to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing space. While the resulting rents may not serve the most acutely low-income individuals, the goal is to create a new supply of housing for those with vouchers or modest incomes.</p>

          <p>The plea deals reached with the defendants in the 9/11 terror attacks case, including alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have been officially canceled. This development all but ensures further delays in a legal process that has been stuck in pretrial hearings for over two decades at Guantanamo Bay. The deals would have allowed the defendants to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, avoiding a death penalty trial. Legal experts note that the cancellation will likely spark its own round of litigation, pushing any potential trial or resolution even further into the future and frustrating family members seeking closure.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine at a medical center on Long Island, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately drew him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." Patients are strictly instructed to remove all metal objects before entering an MRI environment due to the extreme danger of projectiles. The incident highlights the immense and potentially lethal force of MRI magnets.</p>

Bronze emphasized that while players are open to criticism, they are not open to abuse, which she sees as a growing problem targeted specifically at women's football online.

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to address issues such as leaky pipes, incorrect billing, and other disputes. The move is part of a wider overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and a dramatic increase in sewage discharges into UK waterways.

The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to remove an immediate threat and disputed the number of casualties. The incident is one of the deadliest for aid-seekers during the war and occurs amid dire warnings from the UN and health officials about surging malnutrition and starvation in Gaza.</p>
