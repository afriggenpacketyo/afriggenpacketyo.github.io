          <p>Canada is experiencing a major measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 cases, a number significantly higher than in the U.S. despite a smaller population. The epicenter is in Alberta, but the outbreak began in Ontario, primarily spreading through unvaccinated Low German-speaking Mennonite communities. While vaccine hesitancy fueled by post-pandemic misinformation is a major factor, experts also point to underreporting and the specific concentration of certain communities as potential reasons for the rapid spread. Health officials emphasize that increasing vaccination rates is the only effective way to stop the virus.</p>

          <p>The body of a 9-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Frattolin, was discovered in upstate New York after her father reported her missing and possibly abducted. New York State Police are now investigating the father, Luciano Frattolin, due to "inconsistencies" in his timeline and account of the events. Authorities have stated there is currently no indication of an abduction and no threat to the public. A news conference is scheduled as the investigation into the girl's death continues, leaving her family and community in search of answers.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the current HUD Secretary and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported President Trump's demand for the Washington Commanders to change their name back. Trump had posted on social media that the team should "IMMEDIATELY" revert to its old moniker and threatened to block a potential stadium deal in Washington if they refuse. The team's current owner, Josh Harris, has previously stated that the franchise is moving forward with the Commanders name and is not looking back at the controversial former name.</p>

          <p>A market analyst challenges the notion that upcoming tariff deadlines will harm highly valued stocks, arguing that the market is buoyed by stronger fundamental factors. The article points to a strong earnings season, numerous consumer-friendly provisions in President Trump's proposed tax bill, and significant business tax relief as key drivers for economic optimism. Additional factors cited include massive infrastructure spending on data centers and the grid, relaxed bank lending rules, and a pro-business M&A environment, suggesting a potential boom despite trade tensions.

          <p>The UK's Department for Work and Pensions has warned that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are boosted. To address this, the government is reviving the Pensions Commission to investigate why nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a new strategy to tackle the savings shortfall and address disparities, such as the significant gender gap in private pension wealth.</p>

SpinQ's founder, Xiang Jingen, tempers this optimism by comparing the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, highlighting that significant development is still required before it becomes broadly applicable and accessible.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's mass deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The shift in opinion appears linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. Meanwhile, the poll reveals a strong public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as disapproval of Trump's handling of inflation reaches a new high. The president's overall approval has slipped, driven by these concerns outside of his core political base.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. The ORD provides the foundational science for regulations on hazards like toxic chemicals, air pollution, and climate change. The closure is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23%, which the administration says will make the agency more efficient. Critics, including congressional Democrats and environmental groups, have condemned the move as a "travesty" that will cripple the EPA's ability to protect public health.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Advises Parents to Teach 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parenting phrases like "you're fine" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, allow space for them to make choices, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence from within.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the difficult environment American companies face operating in China, comparing it to walking a tightrope. He notes that while a recent 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, the fundamental trade relationship remains fraught with tension. According to Stein, the business community is concerned that discussions between the two governments have focused almost exclusively on tariffs. This narrow focus overlooks broader operational and market access issues that create uncertainty for the over 270 American companies his council represents.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. With a $300-million investment fund, the initiative provides upfront capital to developers, cutting years and significant costs from the typical government-funded process. Better Angels is bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and at a fraction of the cost of subsidized housing. The model relies on building for low- to moderate-income tenants to attract private capital.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after his heavy metal necklace caused him to be violently pulled into a running MRI machine. The man, identified by his wife as Keith McAllister, had reportedly entered the MRI room to help her after her scan when the machine's powerful magnet attracted the 20-pound chain he wore for weight training. The incident resulted in a "medical episode," and he died at the hospital the next day. MRI facilities require the removal of all metal objects due to the extreme magnetic force.</p>

Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation of receiving racist messages during the Euro 2025 tournament, prompting a police investigation. Bronze emphasized that while players are open to criticism, they are not open to abuse, which she feels is particularly targeted at female players online. The Lionesses squad held meetings to address the issue and has decided to stop taking a knee, seeking a new way to combat racism.</p>

          <p>A recent report sheds light on the reportedly constrained college experience of Barron Trump at New York University. According to a classmate cited in Vanity Fair, the former president's son, who is said to be 6-foot-7, declined an invitation to play pickup basketball, stating he was "not allowed" to. The article suggests that due to security and public scrutiny, his life on campus is largely limited to attending classes and returning home. This paints a somber picture of a young person's life in the public eye, shaped by circumstances beyond his control.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to establish a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. The move is part of a larger overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and pollution. The new consumer champion will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies. This reform comes as the Environment Secretary described the current sector as "broken" and its regulator, Ofwat, as "clearly failing," vowing to halve sewage spills by 2030.</p>

Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, sparked "Fernandomania" in 1981 and became a cultural hero. Fans gathered to admire the tribute to the player they knew as "El Toro," whose impact transcended the baseball field.</p>
