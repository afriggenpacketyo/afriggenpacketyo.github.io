          <p>Environmental organizations have filed a federal lawsuit to stop the construction of a new ICE detention facility near Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The suit alleges the Trump administration bypassed required environmental reviews for the site, which is planned to house 5,000 detainees. Officials defend the project, stating the land was previously developed and that the new facilities are temporary. The legal challenge highlights the conflict between the administration's immigration enforcement agenda and environmental protection concerns for the sensitive ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate held a crucial procedural vote to advance a sweeping tax and spending package championed by President Trump. The legislation, which aims to cut taxes and fund immigration and defense priorities, faces a tight path to passage due to divisions within the Republican party. Some GOP senators have expressed concerns over proposed cuts to Medicaid and the bill's impact on the national deficit. The White House is pressuring Congress to pass the measure by the July 4th holiday, framing it as a key test of Republican unity and promise-keeping. (not investment advice)</p>

The motion argues that the aggressive tactics have spread fear throughout communities, negatively impacting the local economy and public welfare.

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the AI race hinges on chips, algorithms, and applications, with the U.S. maintaining a clear lead in hardware. However, he highlighted Chinese start-ups like DeepSeek, which have achieved competitive results with top Western models using far less computing power. This suggests China is making strategic breakthroughs in algorithm engineering to overcome its hardware constraints. (not investment advice)</p>

While lacking the blockbuster rulings of previous years, the court's 6-3 conservative majority consistently sided with GOP-led states on issues like transgender medical care and abortion clinic funding. The court also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural victory for the Trump administration. The term reflects a "states-rights" style of conservatism and a judiciary grappling with the scope of presidential authority.</p>

          <h2>9,000-Year-Old City in Turkey May Have Been a Matriarchal Society, Study Suggests</h2>

          <p>New genetic research from the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society over 9,000 years ago. After analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings, which also show females received significantly more grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has sentenced two men to life in prison for their roles in the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants found in an abandoned tractor-trailer in Texas. Felipe Orduna-Torres and Armando Gonzales-Garcia were convicted for their part in the smuggling operation, where 64 people were transported in suffocating conditions with no water or air conditioning. The tragedy is one of the deadliest smuggling incidents in U.S. history and grimly illustrates the dangers migrants face. The sentences conclude a major chapter in the legal response to the horrific event.</p>
