          <h2>Trump's Middle East Diplomacy Shifts Focus Away from Israel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 13:10:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts in the Middle East signal a shift in U.S. foreign policy, with Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu seemingly taking a backseat as Trump focuses on negotiating peace deals with Iran and Yemen, and securing business deals with Gulf nations. During his five-day tour through the Middle East, Trump did not stop in Israel, underscoring this shift. This approach contrasts with previous administrations, where Israel held a central position in American foreign policy in the region. Despite assurances that the U.S. will not abandon its historic ties with Israel, the change in diplomatic fortunes has raised concerns among Israeli officials, particularly regarding Trump's approach to Iran. </p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has offered federal resources to the affected states, while Kentucky officials are working to secure emergency housing and apply for federal disaster assistance. The storms, part of a larger weather system, also brought tornadoes to Wisconsin, extreme heat to Texas, and dust storms to Illinois. </p>

He highlights the normalization of unacceptable behavior and advocates for a national conversation on character starting at the grassroots level, suggesting it is the key to restoring America's moral standing and global influence.

Ukrainian officials reported intercepting a significant number of drones, but the barrage underscores an escalation in aerial attacks that have become increasingly frequent and intense throughout the conflict.

          <p>Student loan borrowers are bracing for wage garnishment as the Trump administration resumes collection activity on defaulted federal student loans. After a five-year pause, the government will once again seize tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits, impacting millions of borrowers. The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of disposable income and federal benefits, potentially forcing borrowers to choose between essential expenses. Many borrowers who default on their student loans cannot afford to pay them, and this aggressive collection activity marks a shift away from the Biden administration's relief measures. </p>

          <p>Following President Trump's demand that Walmart absorb the costs of tariffs, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that the retail giant will comply. Bessent stated that he received assurance from Walmart CEO Doug McMillon that the company would "eat some of the tariffs," despite Walmart's earlier announcement that it would raise prices for consumers. Trump's initial tariff plans, which targeted numerous countries, created market chaos and slowed economic growth. The administration has since attempted to walk back some of the excesses, including a temporary reduction in tariffs on China. </p>

This new stage in the 19-month war is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing the hostages it is still holding and ultimately destroying the group or forcing it to surrender, according to the Israeli government and military officials. Israeli warplanes have been pounding Gaza in recent days to prepare the way for the expansion of ground operations, the military said, adding that the wave of strikes had hit what it described as more than 670 “Hamas terror targets.” More than 53,000 Gazans have been killed so far in the war. </p>
