          <p>Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, has successfully dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project. This action follows the discovery of over 394,000 Windows computers infected with the Lumma malware between March 16 and May 16. The malware was used by hackers to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, bank account information, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft obtained a court order to seize web domains and redirect them to Microsoft sinkholes, disrupting communications between the malware and its victims and bolstering online security for users.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Original Sin," claims that former President Joe Biden and his late son, Beau Biden, deliberately concealed details about Beau's cancer diagnosis during his time as Delaware's attorney general. The book alleges that the Biden family wanted to keep Beau's condition a secret and misled the media about his health. Beau Biden, who served as attorney general of Delaware, reportedly used the alias George Lincoln when receiving treatment at hospitals to maintain privacy. Beau Biden died of a glioblastoma brain tumor in May 2015 at the age of 46.</p>

Russian spies used hacking techniques to access networks, including internet-connected cameras monitoring aid shipments into Ukraine.

While the policy could benefit moderate to middle-income workers, it also raises potential issues such as income misclassification and the introduction of tips in new occupations.

The legislation proposes significant tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthy, while increasing funding for the military and immigration enforcement. To offset these costs, the bill would cut health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs.

This approach deviates from the traditional prosecutorial rule of speaking only through evidence and court filings. Martin's statement appears to violate the department’s ethical and procedural rules, which mandate “fair, evenhanded” investigations to safeguard the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged investigative targets. Since taking office, President Trump has blurred the line between personal score-settling and running the country.</p>

Additionally, the button at the Fire Department for activating the sirens was found to be non-functional. The city is now implementing protocol changes to ensure the Fire Department is solely responsible for siren activation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to block a lower court order requiring the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to provide information to a government watchdog group. The request stems from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel. The administration argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body and therefore exempt from FOIA, while CREW contends that DOGE has substantial authority over the federal government and should be subject to public records requests.</p>
