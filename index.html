          <p>During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged in a heated exchange with Senator Chris Van Hollen over the Trump administration's foreign policy. Van Hollen criticized Rubio's handling of humanitarian aid, deportations, and refugee policies, expressing regret for confirming him as Secretary of State. Rubio defended his actions, asserting that Van Hollen's regret validated his performance. The discussion included a dispute over the deportation of a man to El Salvador, with Rubio accusing Van Hollen of meeting with a gang member, a claim Van Hollen refuted. </p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for stating he doesn't buy rice because supporters gift him so much, a comment deemed insensitive amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace him with Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister. Eto's remark came shortly after the ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. The resignation occurs as Ishiba faces a challenging House of Councillors election and public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising living costs. </p>

Overall export growth slowed to 2%, the weakest since October, with transport equipment exports falling by 4.1%.

          <p>Thames Water has paused its retention scheme to pay out bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its £3 billion rescue loan, following public and government criticism. The company had been accused of circumventing rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses, as the scheme could have provided executives with up to £1 million. Ministers have stated that rewarding themselves for failure is unacceptable, as Thames Water faces heavy criticism over its performance and financial stability. </p>

The method, developed at the University of Nottingham, has shown a 100% success rate in diagnosing tumor types during 50 operations. This "ultra-rapid" method allows surgeons to make more informed decisions during surgery, potentially reducing the need for multiple operations and allowing patients to start treatment sooner.
