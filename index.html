          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advocated for significant changes to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's objectives, emphasizing the U.S.'s commitment to its leadership role within these global institutions. His remarks, delivered during the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, come amid worries that the Trump administration might consider withdrawing the U.S. from these organizations. Bessent's views on climate change, international development, and economic equity contrast with those of other nations. The IMF recently downgraded its global and U.S. growth outlook due to President Trump's tariffs, highlighting trade tensions between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has assessed that some Venezuelan government officials are likely facilitating the migration of Tren de Aragua gang members to the United States to undermine public safety, according to Fox News Digital.

The FBI anticipates that Venezuelan officials may use gang members to threaten, abduct, and kill Venezuelan critics living in the United States. The ODNI assesses that the Venezuelan government provides sanctuary to Tren de Aragua, aiding their crimes and terrorist activities.

          <p>President Donald Trump is urging automakers to shift vehicle production to the U.S., but industry experts say this is not a simple task. The additional 25% auto parts tariff scheduled to take effect by May 3 would raise costs, even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. Relocating production lines requires years of planning, construction, and establishing a supply chain. Automotive executives and experts agree that while more time to adjust to tariffs would be helpful, it doesn't solve the underlying complexities and costs associated with moving production. </p>
