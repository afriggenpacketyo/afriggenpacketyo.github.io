          <p>Karolina Zurawska, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, received an indefinite hospital order for the manslaughter of her six-year-old son, Alexander Zurawski, and the attempted murder of her father. The judge acknowledged the tragic nature of the event, noting the close bond between Zurawska and her son, while also stating that she may never be released. Three forensic psychiatrists unanimously agreed that Zurawska was experiencing a psychotic episode at the time of the killing, with delusions of hearing voices and being instructed by a demonic force. The judge emphasized that Zurawska was not inherently wicked, but rather a woman whose mental state deteriorated under the stress of caring for her son.</p>

          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a private equity executive and lawyer, has been indicted on 116 counts, including predatory sexual assault, for allegedly turning his New York City apartment into a torture chamber.

Hemphill met the women through websites and enticed them with money in exchange for sex and companionship. Investigators found surveillance cameras, hundreds of bullets, high-capacity magazines, and drugs in his apartment. If convicted, Hemphill could face life in prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is accelerating permit approvals for mining, drilling, and fossil fuel projects on public lands, reducing the review process to a maximum of 28 days. The Department of the Interior cited President Trump's declaration of a national energy emergency as justification, aiming to expand oil and gas projects. Environmental advocates criticize the move, saying it bypasses environmental reviews and public input, potentially leading to adverse impacts on public lands and water sources. Experts anticipate legal challenges, highlighting concerns about potential oil spills and inadequate oversight due to looming workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying efforts to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, even at the cost of territorial concessions, as he approaches his 100th day in office. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff has engaged in further peace talks with President Putin in Moscow. Trump expressed dissatisfaction with recent Russian strikes on Kyiv, urging Putin to stop, while also pressuring Ukraine to consider territorial concessions. The proposed framework involves U.S. recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, lifting sanctions imposed since 2014, and Ukraine renouncing NATO ambitions, in exchange for security guarantees and aid for rebuilding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill in the UK could lead to life imprisonment for cyclists who cause death by dangerous cycling. The change aims to align cycling offenses with driving offenses, addressing concerns that the current maximum sentence of two years is insufficient. The government estimates that cyclists caused four of the 1,600 deaths on UK roads last year, so the new law would also allow for five-year sentences for serious injury caused by dangerous cycling, or death by careless or inconsiderate cycling. This legislation seeks to ensure that cyclists who recklessly endanger others face the full force of the law.</p>

          <p>American companies are becoming increasingly cautious about investing in China due to escalating tensions between the US and China, despite Beijing's efforts to attract foreign investment. The American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China) reports that strained US-China relations remain the top concern for its members for the fifth consecutive year. The ongoing trade war, characterized by increasing tariffs, has created uncertainties for US businesses operating in China. Both governments are reportedly collecting feedback from companies to assess the impact of tariffs, with calls for a stable policy environment to foster US-China economic relations.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals mixed American opinions on President Trump's immigration policies, with divided views on deporting suspected gang members and concerns over deporting international students critical of US policy. The poll indicates more respondents believe Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported migrant, should be returned to the U.S. Overall, Americans are nearly evenly split on Trump's handling of immigration, with strong partisan divisions influencing opinions on specific deportation issues.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr., often portrayed as boxing's villain, is now seen as an unlikely anti-hero as he prepares to fight Conor Benn. The fight comes two and a half years after their original bout was cancelled due to Benn's failed drugs tests, tarnishing Benn's reputation and shifting public perception. Eubank has expressed his desire to have his father, Chris Eubank Sr, at the fight, despite their fractured relationship.</p>
