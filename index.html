          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference after being arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Baraka, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, was taken into custody on trespassing charges while supporting members of New Jersey's congressional delegation touring the facility, which he claims lacked necessary permits. Baraka disputed the U.S. Attorney's account, stating he was invited inside and remained for over an hour, and the trespassing charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison. The mayor's arrest has sparked rallies and protests against the facility.</p>

          <p>Michael Kestner, the CEO of Pain MD, received an 18-month prison sentence for defrauding Medicare and other insurance programs through unnecessary injections to patients, despite federal prosecutors seeking a nearly 20-year sentence.

Pain MD ran multiple clinics and administered roughly 700,000 injections over eight years, with some patients testifying they tolerated the shots out of fear of losing their painkiller prescriptions, and one former patient expressed outrage at Kestner's lenient sentence.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, cautioned that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China. Despite beating quarterly earnings expectations, Walmart noted that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than any retailer can absorb, leading to concerns about the impact on consumers. The company expects net sales to increase for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. The case addresses whether lower court judges can block presidential orders nationwide, with the Trump administration arguing that universal injunctions undermine the president's ability to carry out his policy agenda. Legal experts contend that ending birthright citizenship would violate the 14th Amendment, potentially rendering tens of thousands of children undocumented or stateless.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling 25 shares of Eaton (ETN) to lock in gains following a recent rally, reducing its weighting in the portfolio. The Club had previously capitalized on concerns about DeepSeek's impact on the data center market and tariff-related uncertainty to acquire Eaton shares at lower prices. With the stock now trading near $330, up significantly from previous buys, the Club is lightening its position and downgrading its rating to a hold-equivalent 2. This move aligns with the Club's disciplined approach to managing an overbought market, following similar trims in Texas Roadhouse and Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political debate is growing over "debanking," the practice of banks closing accounts or denying services based on political positions, with concerns raised by conservative, religious, and cryptocurrency groups, as well as the Trump Organization. While no legal right to a bank account exists, banks are prohibited from discriminating based on race or gender, but can avoid customers deemed risky, which some see as prejudice. The Trump administration may issue an executive order to force large banks to provide "fair access" to their products, while the Treasury Department calls debanking "un-American."</p>

          <p>Chinese satellites have been observed making unusual zigzag movements in space, raising concerns among space observers and the Pentagon about their purpose and proximity to U.S. spacecraft. China's advancements in orbital inspection, repair, and refuelling technologies, crucial for sustaining space services, also raise fears that these techniques could be used for military purposes, such as capturing images, intercepting signals, or damaging rival satellites. China has developed a comprehensive space defence system, leading in direct ascent and co-orbital anti-satellite technologies in low Earth orbit.</p>
