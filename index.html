          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off nearly all of its remaining staff, severely impacting programs related to firefighter health, miner safety, and safety equipment approvals. These layoffs, following an initial round earlier in April, have halted new investigations into workplace health hazards and stalled the approval of crucial safety equipment like N95 masks.

          <p>Australia is preparing for a general election amidst a challenging economic and political climate, marked by a cost-of-living crisis and strained international relations. Voters are primarily concerned with issues such as inflation and housing affordability, with both major parties pledging measures to alleviate these pressures. The election also reflects a cultural divide, particularly regarding Indigenous recognition, and a shift away from traditional parties towards independent candidates. The outcome will determine who can navigate Australia through these turbulent times, including relations with the United States and China, while addressing domestic economic woes.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is advocating for a new policy that would require new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials before approval, a move described as a "radical departure" from current practices. This policy would necessitate studies where half the participants receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine. While proponents argue this ensures safety, critics express concern about the ethics of using placebos when effective vaccines already exist. The exact definition of a "new" vaccine under this policy remains unclear, particularly regarding updated annual vaccines like those for the flu and COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, solidifying its position as a major challenger to Britain's main political parties. The party secured hundreds of seats, winning control of several authorities from the Conservatives and displacing Labour in key areas. These results mark Reform UK's first mayoral contests and reflect a broader fragmentation of the British political landscape, with both Labour and the Conservatives experiencing losses. Farage aims to establish a foothold in town halls as a stepping stone toward the next general election, focusing on reducing local government expenditure and scaling back diversity and climate policies.</p>

          <p>Seven months before the Pacific Palisades fire, Los Angeles water managers planned to revive an old reservoir to boost the area’s water capacity while the main reservoir was offline for repairs. Emails show the city sought solutions but failed to complete the project in time. The inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the potential water supply, and firefighters reported hydrants running dry. A lawyer representing wildfire victims said water supply issues were central to some legal claims surrounding the fire, but the city ultimately determined that bringing the reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby homes because of structural and other safety issues.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst a global crisis, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) seeking to maintain its long-standing rule. Voters are concerned about the rising cost of living and housing affordability. The opposition is gaining support, criticizing the P.A.P.'s response to these issues. The election could be a referendum on change, testing the popularity of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong after he took office last year, and voters have been moving away from the two major parties that have long been dominant, instead turning to independent candidates and minor parties.</p>

          <p>Michael Jeffries, the former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, has been ruled incompetent to stand trial on sexual assault charges due to cognitive impairments. A federal judge ordered him to be hospitalized for treatment, hoping his mental condition improves. Jeffries, who faces charges of sex trafficking and interstate prostitution, has been free on bond since his indictment. The charges echo previous allegations of misconduct, and Jeffries' lawyers have stated his condition is progressive and incurable.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty being the main concerns. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party is slightly ahead in opinion polls. The election is happening during a time of heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's policies. Albanese is promising modest tax cuts and cheaper health care, while his rival Peter Dutton is vowing to slash fuel tax and invest in infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cease withholding funds from Maine schools after a dispute over transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funds for a child nutrition program because Maine would not comply with demands to bar trans girls from girls' sports. Maine sued the USDA, and a settlement was reached, restoring the funds. The governor said the USDA had frozen funds for a program that helps feed 172,000 children in the state.</p>

          <p>Scientists say that antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades have led to an "unparalleled" antivenom. Tim Friede's blood has been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. Current therapies must match the specific species of venomous snake, but Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. The research identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ordered the State Bar of California to revert to the traditional national exam format after a botched February exam. The court lowered the passing score on the February exam and directed the agency to abandon its new multiple-choice questions. The decision came shortly after the State Bar of California announced that its executive director, Leah T. Wilson, will step down in July, with many test takers urging Wilson to resign after the exam was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities.</p>
