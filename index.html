          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that his administration will likely impose a baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries without a specific trade agreement with the U.S. This represents a potential increase from the 10% rate previously suggested for many smaller nations. Speaking in Scotland, Trump emphasized the need for a simple, global tariff rate rather than negotiating hundreds of individual deals ahead of his administration's August 1 deadline. This policy follows recent agreements that set 15% tariffs on goods from Japan and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Roy Cooper, the former two-term Democratic governor of North Carolina, has officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026. He is seeking to fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. In his announcement video, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight to protect the American middle class, criticizing recent federal policies for favoring corporations and the wealthy. Having previously served as the state's longest-serving attorney general, Cooper enters the race with significant political experience, and his bid is seen by Democratic leaders as a key opportunity to flip a Republican-held seat.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated that his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein ended years ago because Epstein repeatedly "stole" employees from him, despite being warned not to. Speaking in Scotland, Trump described Epstein as "persona non grata" at his Mar-a-Lago club after the incidents. This explanation comes amid renewed questions about their relationship following the Justice Department's handling of investigative files related to Epstein. Previous reports had suggested their falling out was over a real estate deal, but Trump insisted the dispute was over Epstein hiring his staff.</p>

Researchers showed participants virtual reality avatars, some of which appeared sick with rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response, including increased activity of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). The findings open up potential therapeutic applications, such as using VR to modulate immunity for allergies or autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a dangerous condition that contributes to 5-10% of general aviation accidents. The system uses haptic vibrations, delivered through a flight suit or pilot's seat, to provide sensory cues that help a pilot determine their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in bad weather. This technology functions similarly to lane departure warnings in cars, aiming to provide an intuitive, non-visual way to correct flight path.

          <p>This article analyzes whether a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is currently a better option for growing a $20,000 sum. By calculating potential earnings based on current interest rates, the analysis shows that short-term CDs with terms of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months consistently earn slightly more interest than a high-yield savings account. A key advantage of the CD is its fixed interest rate, which guarantees the return, whereas the rate on a high-yield savings account is variable and could decrease.

          <p>A regional express train derailed in southern Germany, resulting in the deaths of three people and injuring at least 41 others. The incident occurred in a forested area after the train reportedly hit mud and debris from a landslide triggered by torrential rain. Two carriages toppled down an embankment, and the victims were identified as the train's driver, a trainee, and a passenger. Authorities are investigating the train's data recorder to determine the exact cause, but there is currently no indication of foul play. The region had experienced intense rainfall just hours before the accident.</p>

          <p>When asked if he believed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's denial of a starvation crisis in Gaza, former U.S. President Donald Trump responded, "I don't know." He then added that images of children on television suggest they "look very hungry." During the same meeting in Scotland, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the situation in Gaza as a humanitarian crisis and "an absolute catastrophe." The exchange occurred as the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza reported more deaths from malnutrition and Israeli airstrikes, highlighting the ongoing and severe humanitarian issues in the region.</p>

          <p>In response to a declining population and record-low birth rates, the Chinese government will offer an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) per child for families with children under the age of three. This national policy follows similar initiatives by over 20 provincial governments, which have been offering financial incentives and extended leave to encourage couples to have more children. China's population has fallen for three consecutive years, as young people are often deterred by high childcare costs and career pressures. Analysts view the subsidy as a positive but likely insufficient step to reverse the demographic trend.</p>

A memorandum of understanding confirms the "unconditional donation," which the White House insists is a legal and bona fide gift, though it has drawn criticism and questions regarding constitutional rules against a president accepting gifts from foreign states. The Pentagon will be responsible for the costly security upgrades to the aircraft. The plane, valued at $400 million, is slated to be donated to Trump's presidential library after his term.</p>

          <p>Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, was forced to cancel dozens of flights after its IT systems were targeted in a major cyberattack. A pro-Ukrainian hacker group named Silent Crow, in collaboration with a Belarusian group, claimed it "completely destroyed" the airline's systems and threatened to release the personal data of all Aeroflot passengers. The airline confirmed widespread delays and cancellations due to an information system failure, and Russian authorities have opened a criminal investigation. This attack is a notable instance of cyber warfare having a direct and visible impact on a major Russian civilian company.</p>

          <p>A decade after tactical trends suggested the classic center-forward was becoming obsolete, this summer's transfer market indicates a major resurgence of the position. While teams like Spain's 2012 Euro winners popularized the "false nine," top clubs are now heavily investing in traditional strikers like Viktor Gyökeres and pursuing players like Alexander Isak. The success of Erling Haaland at Manchester City, a player who does not conform to the typical fluid forward role, signaled a shift. This analysis suggests that the role has evolved, with modern strikers combining a range of skills, but their primary function as a central goalscorer is once again highly valued.</p>

          <p>With shifting economic conditions, homeowners are reassessing how to best tap into their home equity. This article consults mortgage professionals on whether a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is the better choice. Experts suggest home equity loans offer predictability with a fixed rate, which is valuable amid interest rate uncertainty. Conversely, HELOCs provide flexibility and could become cheaper if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's specific needs, risk tolerance, and whether they need a lump sum or flexible access to funds over time. (not investment advice)</p>

While some see it as a one-off financial decision, others view it as a signal of a broader decline amid shifting viewer habits and rising production costs. The article notes that while NBC has extended its late-night hosts' contracts, the fate of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" after 2026 will be a key indicator. Despite high ratings, Colbert's show faced significant annual losses, reflecting the economic pressures on traditional television in the age of streaming.</p>

Urban economists found that metros like Phoenix and Atlanta are now building far less housing relative to their growing populations, a trend that previously led to hyper-expensive markets in coastal cities like Los Angeles. The article argues that the traditional American model of suburban sprawl is failing, as restrictive zoning and local opposition prevent densification. Without significant policy changes to allow for more diverse and dense housing, these booming suburbs are projected to become increasingly expensive. (not investment advice)</p>

Kidnapping for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a pervasive problem in the region. Despite a 2022 law criminalizing ransom payments, families often feel they have no choice but to pay.</p>
