          <p>Meta AI users can now adjust their privacy settings to prevent their prompts from being shared publicly on Facebook and Instagram. The Meta AI app, launched in April, has faced criticism due to some users' prompts being unintentionally shared, raising privacy concerns. To protect their privacy, users can access the 'data and privacy' section in their profile settings and disable the 'suggesting your prompts on other apps' feature for Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, users can manage their information and make all public prompts visible only to themselves, as well as delete their prompt history. The company has invested heavily in AI to compete with other tech companies and bolster its AI strategy. The app is meant to offer inspiration and AI hacks to users.</p>

          <p>Stocks closed sharply lower on Friday, and oil prices surged following Israel's military strike on Iran, igniting investor anxiety over a potential broader conflict in the Middle East. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 750 points, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also experienced significant declines. The market downturn was triggered by Israeli strikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites, which prompted retaliatory measures from Iran. The tensions have also impacted the oil market, with U.S. benchmark crude oil prices increasing by over 7%. The market is concerned about the Strait of Hormuz potentially being closed which could disrupt global oil supply, and airline stocks also experienced losses due to rising fuel costs and travel uncertainty.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old, pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee, following his return from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors accuse him of conspiring to transport undocumented migrants, including minors, within the U.S. for profit. The judge is considering whether to hold a pre-trial detention hearing to determine if Abrego Garcia should remain in custody. The government's case relies on a 2022 traffic stop and testimony from alleged co-conspirators, some of whom have received deals in exchange for their cooperation. Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue the government's case is weak and that their client is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, adding that the Trump administration's arguments for a detention hearing are meritless.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that a significant portion of Iran's primary enrichment site, Natanz, has been destroyed in Israeli strikes. IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi informed the United Nations Security Council that the site's electricity infrastructure and backup generators were also heavily damaged. While there was no indication of a direct attack on the underground cascade, the loss of power may have damaged the centrifuges. Radioactivity levels surrounding the site were normal, but radiological and chemical contamination inside the facilities at Natanz requires appropriate radiation protection measures, according to the IAEA.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent military actions against Iran have raised critical questions about the conflict's trajectory and potential outcomes. Key factors include whether Israel's objective is limited to demolishing Iran's nuclear program or if it aims for regime change, the extent of Iran's retaliatory capabilities, and how these events will influence Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons. While Israel has targeted Iranian military leadership and infrastructure, the full impact of these strikes and Iran's response remains uncertain. The conflict's scope and potential for escalation depend on these unresolved questions, with implications for regional stability and international involvement.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' proposed legislation, including changes to the child tax credit and SNAP, may disproportionately affect low-income families. While the bill includes provisions like investment "Trump accounts" for newborns and an enhanced child tax credit, it also emphasizes work requirements that could reduce aid for low-income children. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that households in the bottom 10% of income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year due to reductions in in-kind transfers, particularly Medicaid and SNAP. Critics argue that the proposed changes would raise the credit for wealthier families while excluding vulnerable families from the credit.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump claims his country was not involved with Israel's attacks on Iran, while threatening that if Tehran doesn't reach a nuclear deal with the US, attacks on Iran "will only get worse." Israel's attacks early Friday morning were mainly directed against military facilities and sites involved in Iran's nuclear program, such as the Natanz nuclear facility. After Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear infrastructure, Trump was quoted as saying that "Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb." Further nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran are unlikely after the attacks.</p>

          <p>Despite a trend toward moderation or non-alcoholic alternatives, songs about drinking remain popular. "Three Nights Drunk," a 250-year-old song about an adulterous wife, is featured on a new compilation of boozy tunes culled from the Lomax Archive. Record producer David Katznelson, who curated Drinking in Here, said, "Drinking songs are about camaraderie, which is something we really need right now." Drinking songs continue to endure, with artists like Post Malone, Shaboozey and Beyoncé all contributing to the genre.</p>
