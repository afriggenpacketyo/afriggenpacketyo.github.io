          <p>Swedish authorities have apprehended six individuals in connection to a suspected triple murder that occurred at a hair salon in Uppsala. The suspects' ages range from under 18 to 45, with one believed to be the perpetrator of the killings, which took place on Tuesday evening. The victims, aged between 15 and 20, were fatally shot in the salon, prompting a police investigation into potential links to gang-related activities.

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders' meeting, Warren Buffett voiced his disapproval of President Trump's use of tariffs as a tool in global commerce. Buffett, whose conglomerate faces potential impacts from American trade policies, stated that trade should not be a weapon and defended global trade flows, drawing applause from shareholders. Despite Berkshire Hathaway reporting a drop in first-quarter earnings, attributed to losses tied to the California wildfires, Buffett downplayed market volatility, reiterating his long-term praise of the United States as a land of opportunity.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes due to human selection, despite being separated by millions of years of evolution. The study analyzed skull scans and found that selective breeding has led to convergence, with breeds like Persian cats and pugs sharing similar flat-faced structures. This trend, driven by human preferences for infant-like features, has resulted in exaggerated traits that can cause health problems in these animals. The research highlights the significant and sometimes detrimental impact of human intervention on animal evolution.</p>

          <p>Thousands of supporters of the Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam protested in Dhaka against government proposals to enshrine equal rights for women, including equal inheritance rights and a ban on polygamy. The group claimed that these proposals violate religious laws and hurt the sentiments of the majority of the people. The protest highlights the growing visibility of Islamist parties in Bangladesh since the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, amid pressure on the interim government to announce an election date.</p>

          <h2>Experts Disagree with Trump's Claims of Falling Grocery and Gas Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery and gas prices are falling, but experts say this is misleading. Economists point to federal government data showing that food prices have actually increased since Trump took office, and gas prices have remained relatively flat. While overall inflation has eased slightly, this still indicates an increase in price levels. Experts also noted that some food items, like eggs, have seen significant price hikes, contradicting Trump's assertions.</p>

The party plans to scrutinize council staff working on climate change initiatives and Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion, and resist central government's placement of asylum seekers in their counties.
