          <p>The Irish-speaking rap trio Kneecap has been banned from entering Hungary for three years, with the government citing national security threats and alleged antisemitic hate speech. The ban prevents their scheduled performance at the Sziget Festival in Budapest. This action follows a series of controversies surrounding the group's pro-Palestinian stance and legal issues faced by a member in the UK for allegedly supporting a proscribed organization. The band has consistently denied the accusations made against them, while continuing to face scrutiny for their political expressions.</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has officially launched a new political party alongside fellow Independent MP Zarah Sultana. The new entity, temporarily named 'Your Party,' aims to provide a "real, democratic alternative" focused on issues like child poverty and corporate profits. The party is not yet registered with the Electoral Commission but plans to field candidates in local elections next year. This move formalizes a split from the Labour Party for Corbyn, who was suspended in 2020 but won his seat as an independent in 2024, and is expected to attract other like-minded independent MPs.</p>

          <h2>Former Colleague Criticizes NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani's Rent Freeze Proposal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 08:00:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former Democratic colleague of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has strongly criticized his proposal to freeze rents on stabilized housing. Kenny Burgos, now CEO of the New York Apartment Association, argues the policy would lead to the insolvency of nearly 40% of the city's housing stock, ultimately harming the low-income tenants it aims to help. Burgos suggests that instead of a rent cap, the city should address the high operational costs of housing, such as property taxes, to solve the affordability crisis. He warns the plan is a short-term fix that could cause long-term damage to the city's housing and tax base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a strong market recovery since the initial shock of new tariffs in April, investment strategists predict a period of increased volatility for the remainder of the year. Investors currently appear to accept the possibility of higher import taxes, buoyed by factors like deregulation and a stimulative budget bill. However, uncertainty remains over how persistently high tariffs will affect corporate profits and consumer costs, with the Trump administration planning to reinstate blanket tariffs on August 1. Experts advise long-term investors to remain focused on economic fundamentals and avoid emotional decisions driven by short-term market swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's Industrial Innovation Fund has invested in Cambridge Terahertz, a startup that developed a 3D imaging system to see inside unopened packages. The technology aims to combat the growing problem of return fraud, where customers return empty or incorrect items for a refund, which cost retailers over $100 billion last year. Cambridge Terahertz's system, which is a miniaturized version of airport security scanners, allows for quick verification of a package's contents without opening it. Amazon sees potential for integrating this technology at various points in its vast logistics network to improve efficiency and reduce losses.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering engineering feat, a fleet of 16 drones successfully transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete up a mountain in China's Yunnan province. The materials were used to construct three electricity transmission towers at altitudes reaching 1,650 meters. The autonomous drones completed the task in just three days, a tenfold increase in efficiency compared to the month typically required to build traditional cableways for such projects. The operation highlights the labor-saving potential and precision of unmanned aerial systems in challenging construction environments, with drones flying along preset routes without manual intervention.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Why US Electricity Bills Are Rising and Likely to Increase Further</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity prices across the U.S. are rising faster than inflation and are expected to continue climbing through 2026. This surge is driven by a combination of factors, including increased demand from data centers and EVs, and insufficient supply. A significant portion of the rising cost is attributed to urgently needed but expensive upgrades to the nation's aging grid infrastructure, with transmission and distribution now comprising over half of utility investments. Regulatory delays, a lack of coordinated planning, and tariffs on materials are further compounding the problem, leading to higher and less reliable power for many Americans.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between Thai and Cambodian troops along their disputed border have resulted in the deaths of at least 12 people, mostly Thai civilians. The fighting, which involved gunfire and rocket attacks from Cambodia and airstrikes from Thailand, marks a significant escalation in a long-standing territorial dispute. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the conflict and have evacuated tens of thousands of civilians from the border region. The confrontation has plunged diplomatic ties to a new low, with Cambodia downgrading relations and Thailand sealing the border crossings between the two countries.</p>

          <p>In its largest-ever operation against extortion, the Mexican government has dismantled a criminal organization with ties to a major drug cartel. The group operated in the central State of Mexico, controlling labor unions and extorting businesses across 14 municipalities in industries like construction and agriculture. Nearly 3,000 security personnel conducted 52 raids, leading to eight arrests of suspected leaders and the seizure of exotic animals, vehicles, and construction materials. This crackdown addresses a widespread problem in Mexico, where cartels often expand into extortion to supplement their income.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will reduce restrictions on U.S. beef imports, a move the Trump administration hailed as a "major trade breakthrough." The eased regulations will allow the import of U.S. beef sourced from Canada and Mexico, which was previously banned due to concerns over mad cow disease (BSE). Australian authorities stated they are now satisfied with the strengthened control and tracing measures implemented by the U.S. The decision follows criticism from President Trump about Australia's trade barriers, though Australian industry analysts believe demand for U.S. beef will remain low due to pricing.</p>

          <p>Swiss food giant Nestle has indicated that prices for products like KitKat bars and Nespresso coffee could rise further in the second half of the year. The company cited pressure from historically high cocoa and coffee commodity costs, which could be exacerbated by U.S. tariffs. While Nestle reported better-than-expected organic sales growth in the first half, driven by previous price hikes, its profit margins dipped due to currency fluctuations and input costs. The company is also conducting a strategic review of underperforming vitamin brands, which could result in their divestment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese agricultural authorities have announced plans to reduce the country's hog breeding inventory to address a persistent oversupply that has caused a significant drop in pork prices. The industry has faced losses for over seven months, an unprecedented duration, due to weak consumer demand and high inventory levels. As of June, the national breeding sow inventory was 3.7% above the official target of 39 million. While analysts expect marginal improvements in the latter half of the year, the overall potential for a strong market recovery remains limited.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey shows that while most Americans feel informed about Social Security, significant misunderstandings persist, particularly regarding the program's future solvency. The survey found that 47% of respondents incorrectly believe benefits will be cut by at least half when the trust funds are depleted, rather than the officially projected 19% reduction. Confidence in the program's future has also declined. The findings highlight a knowledge gap as the program approaches its 90th anniversary, with many people underestimating the financial impact of claiming benefits early versus delaying until full retirement age or later.</p>

This advanced form of dynamic pricing, pioneered by airlines, has led to public outrage and legislative action, with a federal bill proposed to ban the practice. While companies like Delta and Amazon deny using personal data for individualized pricing, investigations have found other retailers offering different discounts based on customer data.

The statement comes as over 100 aid organizations warn of man-made mass starvation in the territory due to the blockade on aid.

Prosecutors argued she was a key participant in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation who repeatedly lied to authorities.
