        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David's Bridal, traditionally known for budget-friendly wedding attire, is expanding into the luxury market with its new Diamonds & Pearls store in Delray Beach, Florida, offering dresses ranging from $700 to over $5,000. This move comes after the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2023, driven by inflation and economic pressures. CEO Kelly Cook explained that the expansion aims to serve brides seeking premium offerings, as the company previously lacked products for the couture segment. David's Bridal is also innovating with AI-powered wedding planning tools and partnerships with DoorDash for quick dress deliveries, while shifting production out of China due to tariff concerns.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the increasing strain on the US aviation system, citing a rise in near-misses and communication blackouts, often due to understaffing. The article highlights the importance of defense in depth, where multiple layers of safety measures prevent disasters. The midair collision near Reagan National Airport is mentioned as an example of what can happen when these defenses fail. The article argues that near-misses should be taken seriously to prevent future tragedies and calls for a renewed commitment to safety and resource allocation in the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike due to a dispute over pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of rail service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The union claims that engineers haven't received a pay raise in five years and that they are paid less than their counterparts. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home and has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service on select routes, though it can only accommodate a fraction of the daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate impacts, and NJ Transit is cross-honoring rail tickets on bus and light rail lines.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is reviewing the Trump administration's assertion of privilege to withhold details regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue the government is obstructing court-ordered fact-finding as they seek his release. The administration claims state secrets privilege to protect information, while Abrego Garcia's legal team seeks additional depositions, potentially including someone with direct knowledge from the White House. The Justice Department argues these requests are unreasonable and beyond the scope of granted discovery.</p>

This controversial move restricts the rights of those who do not meet the full criteria for refugee status but face serious harm in their home country.

The German Constitutional Court may ultimately decide on the legality of this suspension, potentially prolonging the separation for families like Mohammed's, who is struggling to care for his disabled son alone while his wife and daughters remain in Syria.</p>

          <p>China and Russia are planning to construct a nuclear power station on the moon by 2035 as part of the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) project. This power station will support long-term lunar exploration and scientific research. The ILRS, involving over a dozen international partners, is seen as a rival to NASA's Artemis Program. The project aims to establish a scientific research base near the lunar south pole, facilitating both autonomous operations and short-term human missions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how new weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic have highlighted the broken American healthcare system, where access to necessary medications is often difficult and complex. The author points out that insurance coverage for these drugs is limited, forcing many to pay out of pocket or resort to compounded medications with uncertain quality and safety. The article criticizes the high drug prices, the FDA's inadequate oversight, and the health insurance industry's restrictive practices, arguing that these issues contribute to public anger and prevent people from accessing the treatments they need.
