          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu was narrowly defeated by world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a tense, three-hour match at the Cincinnati Open. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is being hailed as further evidence of her resurgence, demonstrating a newfound resilience and the ability to challenge top-ranked players. Her strong showing, built on a solid service game and composure, provides significant positive momentum as she heads into the upcoming US Open, a tournament she famously won in 2021.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta fired more than 180 shots, breaking approximately 150 windows and causing extensive damage that may take months to repair. The shooter, who had reportedly blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for his depression, killed a police officer before he was stopped and later died. The attack targeted multiple buildings on the campus, prompting concerns among public health officials about the long-term impact of anti-vaccine rhetoric and violence against government scientists.</p>

Officials have set up portable showers and are distributing bottled water as residents grow increasingly frustrated. Repairs have been complicated by the need for custom-made pipes, but officials now expect service to be restored by Tuesday night, though a boil water advisory will likely remain in effect through Friday.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season later in the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, which experienced flooding, and is currently moving west. While early models project it could become a major hurricane as it nears the Caribbean, it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. Forecasters predict an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season this year.</p>

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines an "Extreme Home Makeover" episode at the White House, led by a triumphant President Trump. The piece humorously portrays him directing a complete and permanent renovation to reflect his personal taste, including an all-gold Oval Office, a new ballroom, and the removal of the historic Rose Garden. Through exaggerated scenarios and dialogue, the article critiques what it presents as his grandiosity and his treatment of national symbols as personal property.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order delaying the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, pushing the new deadline to mid-November. This move averts an immediate escalation in the trade conflict, which would have seen U.S. duties on Chinese imports return to peak levels of 145%. The extension followed recent trade negotiations and continues the administration's pattern of using tariff deadlines as a fluid negotiating tool in its economic policy with China.

          <p>A new study from Caltech researchers suggests that the next major earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not resemble past events. By analyzing a surprisingly long rupture on a similar fault in Myanmar, scientists concluded that earthquakes do not follow predictable, repeatable patterns. This implies that California's next "Big One" is difficult to forecast and could potentially be even larger than historical quakes, rupturing a longer section of the fault than previously thought possible.</p>
