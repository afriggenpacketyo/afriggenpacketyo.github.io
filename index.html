          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in Veracruz, Mexico, has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and injuries to eleven others. The unrest reportedly began due to inmate anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization, which holds significant influence within the facility. This event highlights the systemic issues in Mexico's penal system, including overcrowding and control by cartels and gangs, as noted in a 2012 human rights report. The Tuxpan prison was operating beyond its designed capacity at the time of the riot.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to improve their survivability against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, enabling them to perform high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. Digital simulations suggest this technology could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent. This innovation aims to counter sophisticated air defense systems by making the drone's flight path highly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman has died and another was seriously injured after being mauled by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. Police responded to a chaotic scene and were charged by two dogs, leading an officer to shoot and kill one of them. The deceased victim, Teodora Mendoza, was found nearby with severe injuries and later died at a hospital. San Bernardino Animal Control subsequently removed 14 dogs from the park, and an investigation is underway to determine their origin and involvement in the attack.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a global network, with members in the UK, that creates, shares, and sells graphic videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. Operating on encrypted messaging apps, these groups are believed to have thousands of members, with some UK-based users reportedly discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of abuse. Animal rights activists have documented a new video of cat torture being uploaded approximately every 14 hours. The disturbing trend has prompted police to investigate links to recent animal cruelty cases in London.</p>

The email threatens to release fabricated embarrassing footage unless the victim pays a ransom, typically in Bitcoin.

To protect themselves, individuals are advised not to engage with the sender, to verify the image source, and never click on unfamiliar payment links.</p>

          <p>In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Doctors Without Borders USA CEO Avril Benoit described the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza, detailing catastrophic injuries and a man-made famine. She noted that aid group clinics are overwhelmed with casualties from chaotic aid distributions, including people with gunshot wounds and crush injuries. When the host asked if a Hamas video of a malnourished hostage was a war crime, Benoit contextualized that Israel's weaponization of food affects everyone, including hostages. She emphasized that U.S. backing of Israel's actions makes it complicit in the unfolding crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade negotiations, China has firmly rejected a U.S. demand to cease purchasing oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and energy security. The U.S. had threatened a 100% tariff to pressure Beijing, aiming to cut off revenue streams for Moscow and Tehran. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged China's stance on sovereignty but expressed optimism that a broader trade deal could still be reached. Analysts suggest China is playing hardball, doubting the U.S. will risk derailing all progress by imposing such a drastic tariff. (not investment advice)</p>

The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, is 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea and is being deployed as a world-first public health initiative. NHS England predicts the program could prevent up to 100,000 infections over the next decade, addressing concerns about rising cases and antibiotic resistance.

The eruption occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the region. Seismologists suggest the quake may have triggered the eruption by shaking the magma system in a volcano that was already close to erupting. An aviation alert was issued, but the sparsely populated area is not under direct threat, and reserve employees have been evacuated as a precaution.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson will not compete in the 200m at the upcoming World Championships after failing to advance to the final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships. She finished fourth in her heat, missing the last qualifying spot by just one-hundredth of a second. This comes during a difficult week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested last Sunday following a domestic violence allegation. As the defending 100m world champion, she has an automatic bye to compete in that event in September.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has secured unique oversight in Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel through an agreement President Trump has termed a "golden share." This arrangement grants the president veto power over major operational changes, such as factory closures or salary reductions. While not a traditional golden share involving equity, it gives the government significant governance rights, reflecting an expanding view of national security to include economic stability. The deal is unusual for specifically naming the president as the arbiter of these key decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World Athletics has approved new regulations that will require athletes in the female category to undergo genetic testing to confirm their biological sex, formalizing a controversial practice. This move revives a long-standing debate over who qualifies to compete as a woman and how to define fairness. Critics point out that sex testing is not new and that current policies often target cisgender women with natural biological variations, such as differences in sex development. The debate highlights a deep conflict between scientific complexity, inclusivity, and the protection of the female sports category.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is defending the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weaker-than-expected jobs report. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to downward revisions in previous months' data as "hard evidence" to justify the move. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, including a Trump-appointed former BLS commissioner. Critics warn the firing is "groundless" and undermines the credibility and independence of government statistical agencies by politicizing their work. (not investment advice)</p>

The 22-year-old suspect faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and conspiracy to enter a prohibited place, joining four others who were previously charged with the same offenses.</p>
