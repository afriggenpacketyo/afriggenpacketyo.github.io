          <p>China has imposed sanctions on five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to drop by more than 8%. The sanctions are a direct response to the subsidiaries' alleged assistance in a U.S. government investigation into China's maritime and shipbuilding sectors. Effective immediately, Chinese organizations and individuals are prohibited from conducting business with the sanctioned firms. This action represents a significant escalation in the ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.</p>

          <p>Wage growth in the United Kingdom showed a slight cooling in the three months to August, with the annual rate dropping to 4.7% from 4.8%. This moderation coincided with a marginal increase in the national unemployment rate to 4.8%, an increase primarily driven by younger individuals. The Office for National Statistics noted that hiring activity appears to be stabilizing after a prolonged weak period, with public sector earnings growing faster than those in the private sector. This data suggests a gradual easing of cost pressures within the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a historic peace agreement to end two years of conflict in Gaza, former President Donald Trump declined to commit to a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. Speaking to reporters, he stated, "We’ll have to see," emphasizing that his current focus is on rebuilding the war-torn territory. The U.S.-brokered deal, signed with regional partners, secured the release of 20 hostages, though critical issues like postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office has revealed that two UK government insulation schemes were severely mismanaged, leaving tens of thousands of homes in need of remedial work. The watchdog found that 98% of homes with external wall insulation installed under the programs have problems that could lead to damp and mould. Failures in the scheme's design, an under-skilled workforce, and suspected fraud were cited as key issues contributing to the widespread problems. The government has committed to ensuring the necessary repairs are made at no cost to the affected homeowners.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new tariffs on imported softwood lumber, upholstered furniture, and kitchen cabinets, which officially went into effect on Tuesday. The duties, set at 10% for lumber and 25% for some furniture, are intended to protect U.S. industries and national security. These tariffs are expected to significantly impact major exporters like Canada, Vietnam, and China, and will likely increase construction costs for homebuyers in an already challenging market.

Norway's foreign ministry called the closure "regrettable" but emphasized that the Nobel Prize is independent of the Norwegian government.

          <h2>Collapsing Global Order Creates 'Three-Body Problem' for European Geopolitics</h2>

          <p>European political leaders are increasingly viewing the current global landscape as chaotic and unstable, with some likening it to the "three-body problem" from Chinese science fiction. This analogy describes an unpredictable system where the actions of the United States, China, and Russia are creating a tumultuous environment for Europe. The U.S. is seen as undermining the global order it created, while China leverages its economic power and Russia wages war on Europe's border. The sentiment reflects a growing concern that the complex geopolitical situation is not solvable, only survivable.</p>

          <p>The personal phone numbers of several prominent figures, including Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump Jr., have been published on a U.S.-based website. The site reportedly uses artificial intelligence to scrape public and private data from across the internet to build a contact database used by recruiters and sales teams. Australian authorities are investigating the matter, which has been described as "obviously concerning" by the opposition leader, whose number was also listed. It remains unclear how the website obtained the private contact information.</p>

Both are reported to be in stable condition in the hospital.

The ministry stated that communication has been maintained within the framework of a bilateral consultation mechanism that was established earlier this year. However, Beijing also used the opportunity to urge the U.S. to "show sincerity" and cease what it described as intimidation and threats of new restrictions. The talks occurred as disputes over issues like China's rare earth export controls continue to strain the relationship.</p>

Despite the strong performance, which was a slowdown from the previous quarter, the country's central bank warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026. The manufacturing sector's growth flattened, weighing on the overall result, while the services sector also saw slower expansion. The Monetary Authority of Singapore kept its policy settings unchanged, projecting that GDP growth will slow to a near-trend pace as global economic conditions evolve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that aimed to phase out the use of PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," in numerous consumer products, including nonstick cookware and children's items. In his veto statement, Newsom expressed concerns about the impact on the availability of affordable cooking products, despite acknowledging the bill's well-intentioned health goals. The legislation, introduced to protect the state's water supply from contamination, was supported by environmental groups but opposed by the chemical and cookware industries. The bill's author has vowed to continue working on the issue.</p>
