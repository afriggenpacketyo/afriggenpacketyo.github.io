          <p>President Trump's intensified attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates, have sent US stocks and the dollar into a slide, raising fears of an economic recession. Trump's criticism, fueled by concerns over his own tariff policies, has added to market turmoil, with major stock indexes experiencing significant losses since the beginning of the year. This situation is compounded by Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes could drive up prices and slow the economy, further unsettling investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 05:42:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's police chief warns of a "cocaine surge" in the country, attributing it to a saturated North American market and a shift in the international drug trade towards Europe. The police chief also expressed concerns that the partial legalization of cannabis in Germany has made law enforcement's work more difficult, as it complicates proving drug dealing when individuals are legally allowed to carry small amounts of cannabis. The incoming coalition government plans to evaluate the cannabis legalization in 2025, with the conservative CDU party potentially seeking to reverse it altogether.</p>

          <p>German beer exports have decreased by 6% over the past decade, while domestic consumption has fallen by 15.1%, indicating a shift in drinking habits. Despite the decline in beer sales, the number of breweries in Germany has increased, though slightly down from 2019. This trend aligns with a broader decline in alcohol consumption in many countries, potentially due to increased awareness of health risks. However, non-alcoholic beer sales have seen a significant rise, suggesting a changing preference among consumers.</p>
