          <p>Jerry Ye, CEO of Whale, an AI startup, discusses the impact of U.S.-China tensions on global business, emphasizing that business remains business and that global opportunities still exist. He notes that the U.S. and China are the largest markets for AI applications, with China focusing on marketing and sales, and the U.S. on niche vertical sectors. Ye also addresses concerns about semiconductor shortages, stating that China currently has sufficient AI computing power and that on-device chips are becoming powerful enough for AI models. He highlights the use of AI in marketing and sales, specifically mentioning Starbucks' use of AI to improve customer experience, such as optimizing order delivery times. He also notes that real-life videos are still needed, as it is hard for generative AI to convey real emotions, real human touch.</p>

          <p>China has announced a plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturing sector, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in key technologies like semiconductors, batteries, satellite navigation, and AI. The plan emphasizes deepening AI integration and fostering industry service providers by 2027, with a goal of having over 85% of manufacturers using computer numerical control in key processes within two years. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to enable IT manufacturers to achieve breakthroughs and move up the global value chain. This initiative is part of the ongoing ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù strategy and highlights IT manufacturing as a crucial component of China‚Äôs industrial system.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law that mandates 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in the fiscal year starting April 2026. The revised law targets companies that produce 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering industries like steel and car production. These companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the limit must purchase carbon credits from companies with surplus credits. The government estimates that the targeted companies account for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions, aiming to incentivize emissions reduction.</p>

Despite the fictional setting, the uniforms and equipment often mirror those used in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with some players even purchasing surplus gear from Ukrainian battlefields. The company emphasizes that the events are strictly fantasy and not intended to reflect current events, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine inevitably serves as a reference point for many participants.

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly considering military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. This tension arises from differing views on how to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, with Netanyahu advocating for immediate action and Trump favoring negotiation backed by the threat of force. Israeli officials fear that Trump's eagerness for a deal may allow Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment facilities. Israel has been preparing for a potential strike, even without U.S. assistance, a move that has led to discussions and intelligence sharing between the two countries.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read's SUV places her at the scene of Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe's death. The expert, Dr. Judson Welcher, stated that the vehicle's black box didn't register a collision, but this was expected as it only registers car-to-car crashes. Welcher matched data from Read's Lexus SUV to O'Keefe's cellphone clock, indicating that Read's vehicle accelerated rapidly, reaching 74% throttle, and backed up, aligning with O'Keefe's final interaction with his phone. He concluded that O'Keefe was likely struck by Read's SUV based on the totality of the evidence.</p>

          <p>A report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) suggests that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is "unlikely in the near future" but "not impossible," particularly given potential misperceptions and miscommunication with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The report highlights strained U.S.-China relations, characterized by deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling a larger portion of shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. This is rare in tech IPOs, and the reason for Circle's decision is not explicitly stated. Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, but the high volume of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns.

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a temporary halt to new student visa appointments as it prepares to expand social media screenings for applicants. The State Department instructed embassies to remove unfilled appointments in anticipation of the expanded vetting process, which could subject all student visa applicants to social media checks. This pause is due to the significant implications for embassy operations, as the administration aims to screen visa applicants for what it calls "antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals."</p>

The unemployment rate among recent college grads is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, largely due to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates and waning demand in sectors like technology.
