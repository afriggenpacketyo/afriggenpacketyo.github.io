        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's Supreme Court has mandated increased food provisions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, overturning a policy of reduced rations implemented by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) brought the matter to court, highlighting malnutrition among prisoners due to the policy change after the Gaza war began. ACRI criticized the prison service for creating "torture camps," while Ben-Gvir condemned the ruling and insisted on maintaining minimum conditions required by law. Leaked data suggests that only a quarter of Palestinian prisoners have links to Hamas or other militant groups, raising questions about the justification for blanket restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 33% in August, contributing to an overall slowdown in export growth to a six-month low, partially influenced by President Trump's measures against transshipments. Imports from the U.S. also decreased by 16% year-over-year, while China's total exports grew by 4.4%, falling short of economists' expectations. Chinese exporters are focusing on alternative markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union due to trade tensions with the U.S. Despite the decline, the U.S. remains China's largest single-country trading partner, though exports to the EU bloc are higher overall.

          <p>The Garnet fire in the Sierra National Forest has expanded, scorching over 46,000 acres with 14% containment, driven by steep topography and weather shifts. Evacuation orders have been issued for additional zones in Fresno County, including the Dinkey Creek Campground area, as the fire crossed Dinkey Creek. Firefighters are focused on reinforcing containment lines, particularly near McKinley Grove Road to protect giant sequoias, utilizing sprinkler lines to dampen the trees. Weather forecasts indicate a potential shift towards cooler and wetter conditions, which could aid firefighting efforts in the coming days, despite the aggressive fire activity.</p>

Routh, representing himself with standby counsel, faces charges including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate and assaulting a federal officer. Prosecutors allege Routh plotted for weeks before aiming a rifle at Trump on September 15, 2024, but was thwarted by a Secret Service agent who opened fire. Routh has a history of erratic behavior and prior arrests, including weapons-related incidents, which prosecutors intend to present as evidence.</p>

The operation, involving the Kinahan organized crime group, highlighted Ireland's vulnerability as a back door to the UK due to its extensive coastline and underfunded defense forces. Despite a record seizure, law enforcement agencies acknowledge the cartels' relentless efforts and vast resources, requiring increased international cooperation to address the expanding drug trade.

The review, led by Baroness Harriet Harman KC, found that trainees fear reporting misconduct due to potential career repercussions and identified a "cohort of untouchables." The findings highlight a power dynamic that discourages junior barristers from speaking out, leading to feelings of isolation and a need for greater accountability. The Bar Council commissioned the review after research indicated increasing instances of inappropriate behavior within chambers and courtrooms.</p>

          <p>A China-US study has found that Mars has a solid inner core, despite expectations that it should not. The discovery was made by analysing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by Nasa’s now-retired InSight lander. The team discovered a solid core about 600km in radius, or roughly 18 per cent of Mars’ radius, a similar proportion to Earth’s inner core. The discovery may revive the idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>
