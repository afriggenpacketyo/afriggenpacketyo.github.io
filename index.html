          <p>President Trump is considering reallocating $3 billion from Harvard University to support trade schools, questioning Harvard's transparency and demanding disclosure of international student details. This action follows Trump's agreement to delay a 50% tariff on the European Union after a call with the European Commission president. Simultaneously, the House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to fund Trump's domestic agenda, now heading to the Senate for further revisions. The president also weighed in on Russia's escalated long-range attacks on Ukraine while criticizing presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

Once established, sexual preference remains stable throughout life, with attempts to change it proving unsuccessful.

          <p>The city of Lakewood, Washington, is investing $500,000 to transform street ends into public access points to lakes like Steilacoom, American, and Gravelly. The project aims to improve access to waterfront areas for residents who may not have private lake access. The first renovation site on Westlake Avenue Southwest will include parking, a path to the water, benches, and native plants. This initiative addresses equity issues by providing community access to state-managed lakes.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker best known for "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. His landmark documentary debunked the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II, sparking controversy and outrage. Ophuls's film interviewed ordinary citizens to reveal the complexities of collaboration and resistance, challenging the heroic narrative fostered by Charles de Gaulle. He went on to direct other documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie."</p>

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that London tends to suspect Russia of involvement in all negative events in Great Britain, but these suspicions are usually groundless and lack evidence. Three individuals, including Ukrainian and Romanian nationals, have been charged as part of the police investigation into the attacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and potential cuts to federal subsidies threaten the growth of the U.S. battery industry, which is crucial for meeting rising energy demands. Domestic factories rely on Chinese components, and tariffs have already caused battery costs to rise. A Republican budget bill could restrict access to subsidies for making and using rechargeable batteries, hindering the industry's competitiveness. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy is causing businesses to delay projects and put off new contracts, impacting the pace at which the country can meet rising power demand.

          <p>The Trump administration is employing a strategy of "legalistic noncompliance" to flout court orders while maintaining the appearance of adherence to the law. This involves using specious legal arguments to conceal pervasive defiance of judicial oversight.

While appearing preferable to outright defiance, this approach lowers public awareness of noncompliance and may lead to legalized noncompliance, where courts allow the administration to appear compliant without genuinely carrying out rulings.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that the potential for a trade war remains despite President Trump's decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union. Although the delay provides a window for negotiations, the underlying issues and Trump's negotiating tactics could lead to further volatility. Experts suggest that the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's shock tactics, and uncertainty persists about the administration's goals. Sectors like tech and industrials are expected to experience significant market fluctuations as a result. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Faces Extreme Heat Amid Trump Administration Cuts</h2>

          <p>The US faces another summer of extreme heat, with NOAA forecasting unusually warm temperatures across most of the country. Experts fear that Trump administration cuts to federal science and disaster response agencies will hamper efforts to protect people. Federal agencies are operating at reduced capacity, with staff reductions impacting weather forecasting services. Local leaders and non-profits are stepping up to provide public outreach on heat and other extreme weather, as climate change intensifies the threat.</p>

          <h2>Trump and Hegseth Fuel Islamic State Recruitment</h2>

          <p>Experts say the Islamic State (IS) is leveraging President Trump's policies, cabinet appointments, and associations with Benjamin Netanyahu for recruitment propaganda. IS propaganda defines the US as a "crusader" state and capitalizes on Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's tattoos referencing crusaders. The terror group also uses the war in Gaza and Trump's international tariffs as recruitment tools. The propaganda, distributed on platforms like Rocket.Chat, has inspired attacks and plots in the US, highlighting the group's continued influence and reach.</p>
