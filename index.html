          <p>Over 168 million Americans, spanning the Midwest, Southeast, and parts of the Northeast, are currently under active heat advisories and warnings, with conditions expected to persist through Thursday in some regions. Temperatures are forecast to reach the high 90s, with "feels-like" temperatures soaring above 100 degrees, potentially reaching 110 or higher in certain areas. This extreme heat significantly elevates the risk of health-related illnesses, urging the public to prioritize hydration and seek air-conditioned spaces. Concurrently, severe storm threats, including high winds and potential tornadoes, are also impacting areas of the Great Plains and Midwest, affecting cities like Chicago and Milwaukee, adding another layer of weather complexity to the nation.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economist Challenges Ray Dalio's Debt Assessment for U.S. and China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Xu Gao, has publicly refuted Ray Dalio's analysis of the debt situations in China and the United States, intensifying the ongoing debate over the fiscal trajectories of the world's two largest economies. Xu, chief economist at Bank of China International (China), argued in a detailed article that Dalio's call for China to deleverage was a "misjudgment" of the country's debt dynamics. He contended that China's recent debt-rollover issues stemmed from overly harsh deleveraging policies that disrupted liquidity, rather than excessive borrowing. Xu suggests that correcting the underlying mindset behind these policies is crucial for macroeconomic stability, contrasting with Dalio's long-standing advocacy for a "beautiful deleveraging" strategy.

          <h2>Lending Experts Forecast Mortgage Rate Trends for August 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:57:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have largely remained in the high 6% range in 2025, disappointing homebuyers awaiting a drop. Experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting for potential benchmark rate cuts, which could significantly influence mortgage trends. However, other factors, including the current administration's tariff policies and inflation concerns, are also impacting rate decisions. Most analysts do not anticipate a Fed rate cut before August, with September being a more likely timeframe, suggesting prospective homebuyers might consider preparing now for potential lower rates later in the year.

          <p>The gunman responsible for a deadly shooting rampage in a Midtown Manhattan office building on Monday evening was reportedly targeting NFL offices, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Investigators found a note from the shooter, Shane Tamura, alluding to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a brain injury linked to contact sports, and appeared to blame the NFL for his condition. Tamura, a former high school football player, took the wrong elevator, leading him to Rudin Management offices where he killed four people, including NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, before taking his own life. The NFL has advised New York employees to work from home and increased security measures.</p>

          <p>Spotify shares dropped over 8% after the company missed Wall Street's second-quarter revenue expectations and provided weak guidance for the current quarter, despite an 11% increase in monthly active users.

The company's net loss widened due to higher personnel, marketing, and professional services costs, along with significant social charges.

This comes as Maxwell appeals her conviction and speculation arises about a potential pardon from President Trump, who has been linked to Jeffrey Epstein. Mahdawi emphasizes that Epstein's accusers consistently state Maxwell was an active participant in their sexual assault, not a victim.

          <p>Gee-Kung Chang, a leading expert in 5G and 6G networks and a Georgia Institute of Technology professor, has been fully cleared after a four-year legal battle under the controversial China Initiative. In March 2021, federal agents stormed his home, handcuffing him and searching his property, leading to nine wire fraud charges and one visa fraud charge. Chang's reputation suffered immensely, with colleagues and friends distancing themselves. However, all charges were eventually dismissed for lack of evidence, with the final visa fraud charge dropped in April, finally clearing his name and highlighting the personal toll of such investigations.</p>

          <p>Five women who were victims of grooming gangs in Rotherham as children now allege they were also sexually assaulted by police officers during that period. One woman claims a serving South Yorkshire Police (SYP) officer sexually assaulted her from age 12 in a marked police car, threatening to return her to the gang if she resisted. These accounts, along with testimony from 25 other victims, suggest corrupt officers either collaborated with gangs or failed to act on child sexual exploitation. A new criminal investigation is underway, but critics, including Professor Alexis Jay, argue SYP should not investigate its own former officers, raising concerns about accountability and trust.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has lowered its 2025 earnings outlook, falling short of Wall Street's expectations, as its insurance unit grapples with persistently high medical costs, particularly within Medicare Advantage plans. The company anticipates adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share, down from prior forecasts, and expects its medical care ratio to increase to 89%-89.5%. CEO Tim Noel attributed the pressure to underestimated accelerating medical trends, including increased physician, outpatient, and inpatient care utilization, and Medicare funding cuts.

This marks the second downgrade to its 2025 outlook this year, reflecting ongoing challenges despite the high demand for its weight-loss treatments.

          <p>Despite President Trump's tariffs, widespread price hikes haven't fully materialized yet, largely due to repeated delays in the steepest levies and companies stockpiling goods to avoid higher import taxes.

However, experts warn that higher prices are still expected, especially if the promised steeper tariffs take effect in August, noting rising warehouse storage costs and slight inflation increases in tariff-affected categories like clothes and appliances.
