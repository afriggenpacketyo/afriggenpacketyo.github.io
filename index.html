          <p>A theft charge against a man accused of taking flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has been officially withdrawn. Prosecutors dropped the case after a court heard that a security guard had granted the man permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction, as it could not be proven that the man acted with dishonest intent when he removed the flowers from the memorial site.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock value increased significantly following a U.S. court ruling on its antitrust case that was largely favorable to its subsidiary, Google. While the company was found to hold an illegal monopoly in the internet search market, it avoided the most severe penalties proposed by the Department of Justice, such as being forced to sell its Chrome browser. The ruling allows Google to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, removing a major source of uncertainty for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

This resurgence follows a challenging period, including a 14-month break for the birth of her daughter and a discouraging Wimbledon exit. A recent change in coaching and a renewed focus on enjoying the game are credited with helping her rediscover the powerful, confident playing style that previously took her to the top of the sport.</p>

          <p>The political career of UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner is facing significant pressure after she admitted to paying an incorrect amount of stamp duty tax on a house sale. Rayner maintains that she acted on flawed legal advice at the time and is therefore not resigning from her positions. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended her, but she now faces an independent investigation into whether she breached the ministerial code, creating a damaging situation for the government.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced that the Autumn Budget will be delivered on November 26th. This statement of the government's tax and spending plans comes as she faces increasing pressure to stabilize public finances while stimulating economic growth. Economists have warned that without significant growth, tax increases or spending cuts will be necessary to meet borrowing rules. The announcement sets the stage for a critical fiscal event that will outline Labour's strategy for managing the UK economy and its public services.</p>

          <p>This article explores the changing depiction of children in art, from medieval religious icons to modern, spontaneous photography. Initially, children in art were often limited to portrayals of Jesus or angels, or as miniature adults in noble portraits designed for political purposes like marriage alliances. The Renaissance and Baroque periods saw a shift towards individual, often idealized, portraits among the wealthy bourgeoisie. Over centuries, the artistic lens expanded to include peasant children and eventually, with the advent of photography, captured the spontaneous and unburdened moments of modern childhood.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed one of its largest aerial attacks of the war, launching over 500 drones and missiles at targets across Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian air defense forces reported downing or suppressing the majority of the munitions, but impacts were recorded in 14 locations, primarily targeting civilian and energy infrastructure in western regions. The barrage resulted in at least one death, caused fires at industrial sites, and prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure, highlighting the escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>During the military parade in Beijing, a hot microphone captured a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping about biotechnology and longevity. As they walked with other world leaders, a translator could be heard relaying Putin's comments on the continuous development of biotechnology, including organ transplants that could lead to immortality. Xi responded by noting that some scientists predict humans may live to be 150 years old in this century, providing a rare, unguarded glimpse into the leaders' private discussions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes China's recent military parade as a powerful symbol of its broader ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global order and establish itself as a superpower. President Xi Jinping's vision aims for China to become a leading modern nation by 2049, a goal supported by economic and political dominance. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and leadership in organizations like BRICS, China is building a network of global partnerships, particularly in the Global South. This "China model" of development is increasingly seen as an alternative to Western-led systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As extreme heatwaves become more common during back-to-school months, school districts across the U.S. are grappling with how to protect students. Many schools, built for a cooler climate, lack adequate air conditioning, forcing them to shorten days or delay openings. This has sparked a broader conversation about climate resilience in education, with potential solutions including HVAC upgrades, creating greener schoolyards, and even rethinking the traditional summer vacation. Some experts suggest that if schools can be made cool enough, they might be safer for children than hot homes during peak summer months.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley analysis predicts that China's struggling property market is poised for a recovery in the second half of the year after a weak first half. The report forecasts that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow significantly, with the possibility of a sales pickup in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' positive guidance, expectations of margin recovery, and the potential start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle.

          <p>Hurricane Lorena has formed in the Pacific Ocean and is forecast to move parallel to the coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula, potentially bringing heavy rainfall and dangerous conditions. The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of possible "life-threatening flash floods and mudslides," even if the storm weakens back to a tropical storm before approaching the coast. While Lorena is expected to undergo rapid strengthening initially, forecasters predict it will weaken as it moves northwest. Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect for parts of the peninsula.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of UK parliamentarians is demanding an investigation into a case where former Premier League players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, lost millions of pounds in an investment scheme. The players, part of the V11 campaign group, allege they were victims of "financial abuse" after investing with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. The MPs argue the players were failed by regulators, financial advisors, and the football industry, and are calling for a resolution to a decade-long tax dispute with HMRC stemming from the investments.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is facing a significant challenge with dwindling attendance at the Rose Bowl, as highlighted by a recent game where the number of people actually in the stadium was far below the officially announced figure. This article reveals that the scan count for the home opener was over 7,000 people fewer than the announced attendance of 35,032. This trend of low turnouts, which has resulted in the five worst attendance seasons occurring in the last five non-COVID years, creates a significant revenue problem for the athletic department and raises concerns about fan engagement.</p>
