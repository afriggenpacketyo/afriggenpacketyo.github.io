          <p>The Trump administration is holding a dinner for numerous high-profile tech executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates. The event, held in the White House's renovated Rose Garden, aims to foster relationships between the administration and the technology sector. Notably, Tesla CEO Elon Musk declined his invitation, citing a prior commitment, though he has had a public falling out with the president. The gathering highlights the complex but often close ties between the administration and major figures in the tech industry, many of whom have aligned with the president's goals on emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a CNBC interview, Pulte deflected questions about potential political motivations, insisting the focus should be on the alleged crime rather than the investigation's origins. The accusations have prompted President Trump to move to fire Cook, who denies the allegations and has sued to block her dismissal. The situation raises concerns about the weaponization of government agencies for political purposes amid Trump's criticism of the central bank.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in the deaths of 16 people after a historic funicular tram derailed and crashed into a building. The Elevador da Gloria, a popular tourist attraction, careened down a steep hill, injuring an additional 21 people, about half of whom were foreign visitors. The Portuguese government has declared a national day of mourning, and an investigation into the cause is now underway. Initial speculation from engineering experts suggests a primary cable may have snapped, a rare event for this type of transportation system, overwhelming the braking mechanisms.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has strongly criticized protesters in Portland, Oregon, for their "unhinged behavior" after a guillotine was displayed outside a federal field office. The demonstration, which also involved burning a flag and clashing with law enforcement, has escalated tensions in the city. An ICE spokesperson highlighted a significant increase in assaults against their officers and called for a de-escalation of rhetoric from politicians and activists. Portland's mayor has affirmed the city's sanctuary status, stating local police will not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, further complicating the relationship between local and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>CEOs of major sportsbooks like DraftKings and BetMGM are forecasting a record year for betting as the NFL season begins. The American Gaming Association projects that legal sports betting in the U.S. will increase by 8.5% to $30 billion this season. Despite broader economic concerns, the sector has shown resilience, with executives reporting no slowdown in consumer activity and significant growth in pre-season volume. The industry is also navigating the emergence of new competition from prediction markets, which operate like stock trading for events and are facing regulatory scrutiny over whether they constitute a form of sports betting.

          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast visualizations for areas covering 60% of the U.S. population. The experimental tool offers near real-time, Google Earth-style maps showing the potential impact of floodwaters on specific neighborhoods. This expansion aims to enhance communication and decision-making for forecasters, emergency managers, and first responders during severe weather events. The tool, which has already proven effective in targeted evacuations, is scheduled for full nationwide activation next year, covering over 110,000 river miles and improving public safety against costly natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman previously convicted of murdering her husband, is facing a new trial after her initial life sentence was overturned. In 2007, her husband, Todd Stermer, died from severe burns after their house caught fire, and Linda subsequently ran him over with a van, an act she claims was accidental. Her conviction was overturned in 2018 by a federal judge who cited prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel. Despite her insistence on her innocence, her sons believe she is guilty, and prosecutors have refiled murder and arson charges, leading to a second jury trial nearly two decades after the incident.</p>

He also identified a specific price point below which he would consider buying the stock.

Analysts project that revenue from custom AI silicon could become a massive growth driver for the company in the coming years.

This legal challenge comes as President Trump has sent hundreds of troops to the capital as part of a broader crackdown on crime, a move that Mayor Muriel Bowser has called unnecessary.

This inflated count of "2 million farms" is often used as a powerful talking point by industry lobbyists to argue against environmental regulations and for subsidies.

          <p>The government of Nepal has ordered its telecommunications authority to block access to several major social media platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. The move comes after these companies failed to register with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology by a set deadline. This registration is part of a broader government crackdown aimed at curbing the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and cybercrime. Digital rights advocates have criticized the sudden shutdown as a "controlling" measure that infringes on the public's fundamental rights, arguing that proper legal infrastructure should be established before such drastic actions are taken.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has revealed that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. Newsom characterized the operation, which began in June, as "costly political theater," with the expenses covering payroll, food, travel, and logistics for over 4,200 soldiers and 700 Marines. Most troops were sent home in August, but 300 remain. The announcement comes after a federal judge ruled the deployment illegal, and Newsom is seeking an injunction to block its extension. This highlights the significant financial and logistical strain such federal deployments place on states, amid ongoing political and legal battles.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has climbed to at least 2,205, with over 3,600 people injured. The quake struck late Sunday night, destroying more than 6,700 homes and leaving thousands homeless in the remote, mountainous provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar. Rescue efforts are severely hampered by the difficult terrain and roads blocked by landslides, forcing some aid workers to travel for miles on foot. The disaster exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis in the country, and the Taliban administration is appealing for international aid, though securing funds may be complicated by the government's lack of formal recognition from many nations.</p>

This structure addresses the numerical imbalance between American and international players in the league. The change comes after the 2024 game, which returned to a simple East vs. West format, was widely criticized for its lack of defensive effort, culminating in a record-high 211-186 final score that Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged was a "miss."</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, a 49-year-old vascular surgeon from Cornwall, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper, who had a sexual interest in amputation, deliberately used ice to freeze his own legs, leading to their medical amputation in 2019. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers by attributing the injuries to sepsis. The investigation also revealed he purchased videos of body mutilation from a website, connecting him to a wider criminal ring. The case has raised concerns among his former patients, though the hospital trust found no evidence of risk or harm in his professional conduct.</p>
