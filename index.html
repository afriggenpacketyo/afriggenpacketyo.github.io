          <h2>Congressional Crypto Regulation Efforts Stalled by Republican Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 17:45:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US crypto regulation bills faced a second day of significant opposition in Congress, effectively halting their advancement and highlighting deep political divides. Despite President Trump's direct intervention and eleventh-hour negotiations, a new bloc of conservative House Republicans objected to proposed changes, complicating the path forward. This legislative stalemate casts considerable doubt on the House Republican conference's ability to unite and pass cryptocurrency legislation, even on measures with broad support. For the crypto industry, this development is a sharp letdown, threatening to derail any hopes of achieving regulatory clarity and progress during what had been optimistically billed as "Crypto Week" in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Donald Trump Jr.-Backed Gun Retailer's Stock Falls Sharply After NYSE Debut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 17:43:43 EDT</div>
        </div>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer backed by Donald Trump Jr., experienced a significant decline of over 20% on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. This debut followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), with Trump Jr. ringing the opening bell and framing the listing as a "vindication" against "woke" cultural trends. The company raised $179 million from the merger, but its initial stock performance reflects considerable market skepticism, challenging the celebratory tone of its launch. This event further illustrates a growing trend of the Trump family and their allies investing in and promoting businesses tied to conservative political causes, frequently utilizing SPACs as a vehicle for public market entry, similar to the recent listing of Trump Media.

          <p>Israel conducted airstrikes on the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria amidst escalating sectarian fighting in the Druze province of Suweida, which has claimed over 300 lives since Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operations aimed to protect Druze communities and eliminate regime-affiliated groups, drawing condemnation from Syria for "treacherous aggression." While US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed concern and indicated an imminent ceasefire agreement, Israel had not yet confirmed its participation in the truce. The humanitarian situation in Suweida has rapidly deteriorated, with reports of tanks attacking hospitals and severe shortages of water and medical supplies, underscoring the tragic human cost of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>"Harry Potter" star Emma Watson has been issued a six-month driving ban in the United Kingdom and fined nearly $1,400 following a speeding offense in 2024. The actress was caught driving 38 mph in a 30 mph zone, which, combined with existing points on her license, led to the suspension. Watson, currently pursuing a master's degree in creative writing at Oxford, did not attend the brief court hearing, with her attorney stating she could pay the fine. This legal setback occurs as Watson has openly discussed her decision to step back from acting, citing a desire for greater control over her public narrative and a feeling of being "caged" by the industry's demands, seeking roles where she has more creative input.</p>

          <p>A major data breach, which secretly led to thousands of Afghans being relocated to the UK, became public knowledge this week following a High Court ruling. The leak, originating from a UK Special Forces official in February 2022, exposed personal details of nearly 19,000 individuals seeking refuge from the Taliban due to their association with British forces. The UK government initially sought a super-injunction to suppress the information, fearing it could endanger those on the list. While a review suggests the leak's spread was less severe than initially feared, approximately 900 individuals and 3,600 family members have been relocated via a covert scheme, costing hundreds of millions of pounds. The incident raises questions about government transparency and accountability.</p>

This decision aligns with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement, which advocates for removing ingredients like corn syrup and artificial dyes due to their perceived health impacts, and plans to update nationwide dietary guidelines. While Coca-Cola products in other countries, such as Mexico and the UK, already utilize cane sugar, this represents a significant reformulation for the American market. Trump, a self-professed Diet Coke drinker, lauded the move as a "very good" and beneficial step for both the company and American consumers.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to tighten its laws against migrant smuggling to the UK by the end of the year, a move aimed at disrupting illegal Channel crossings. This legislative change, part of a new agreement signed during German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's UK visit, will criminalize facilitating illegal migration to non-EU countries like the UK. The measure seeks to make it easier for German authorities to target warehouses and facilities used by smugglers, following a BBC investigation that revealed Germany as a central location for small boat storage. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the commitment, as his government faces increasing pressure to curb the rising number of Channel arrivals, which have surged by 56% this year.</p>

This discovery represents the "birth of the seeds of the planets," offering an unprecedented glimpse into the very beginnings of a new planetary system.

His legal team is actively seeking a new trial, presenting new evidence including statements from pathologists who dispute the original homicide conclusion and question the reliability of the medical examiner's findings. Supporters, including exonerated individuals and a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, vehemently argue Roberson's innocence, emphasizing the ongoing appeals and his previous execution stay, which was granted just hours before his scheduled lethal injection in 2024. The case continues to draw significant scrutiny regarding the reliability of forensic evidence in past convictions and the broader justice system.</p>

If the number of eligible claimants is reduced, the average payout per survivor could significantly increase, potentially exceeding previous large settlements. A contentious point is the agreement's provision for a public archive of child sexual abuse files, which will only include clergy named in at least three verified claims, leading some victims' attorneys to urge a "no" vote on the overall settlement.</p>

          <p>Greek authorities have arrested the ex-wife of UC Berkeley marketing professor Przemyslaw Jeziorski in connection with his July 4 murder in Athens. Jeziorski, 43, was fatally shot five times while walking to his ex-wife's home to see their children. Police also arrested three additional suspects—two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian man—who allegedly transported the ex-wife's companion to the neighborhood and provided him with an automatic handgun. The ex-wife, a Greek national, was reportedly embroiled in a difficult custody dispute over their children with Jeziorski, a renowned expert in quantitative marketing and digital economics. The professor is survived by his mother, brother, and two children.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether, along with several blockchain ecosystem stocks, rallied significantly after the House approved a procedural vote to consider three key crypto regulation bills. This renewed optimism emerged after Republican lawmakers had initially halted the legislation's passage, causing a brief market dip. President Donald Trump's reported intervention swayed several House Republicans to support moving the bills forward, including the Senate-passed GENIUS Act. While Ether's recent surge is largely attributed to momentum and speculative positioning, Bitcoin also saw substantial institutional inflows, indicating continued robust market interest despite ongoing regulatory uncertainties and the complex legislative path ahead.

The bank's net income increased by 15% to $3.54 billion, or $2.13 per share, with total revenue rising 12% to $16.79 billion, exceeding analysts' projections. This strong performance was propelled by heightened client activity, particularly in equity trading within its institutional securities segment, and continued growth in wealth management. CEO Ted Pick emphasized the bank's consistent earnings over six sequential quarters, showcasing its strong performance across varied market environments.

England's performance was characterized by sloppy fielding and a crucial missed LBW review against Sharma, despite strong individual contributions from Sophia Dunkley (83) and Alice Davidson-Richards (53) that rescued their innings from 97-4. This match, part of a crucial series for England ahead of the autumn's World Cup, highlighted areas for improvement in their ground fielding and batting acceleration, as India's improved depth proved decisive.</p>

These state-led efforts include removing fluoride from water supplies, blocking the purchase of soda with food stamps, and mandating warning labels for artificial food dyes and other additives. While Kennedy has advocated for national changes, his strategy appears to deliberately rely on states to implement his vision, circumventing federal regulatory hurdles and the Trump administration's anti-regulation stance.

This policy shift, which also targets Chinese steel, seeks to address Canada's "unsustainable" dependency on US exports and diversify its trading partners.

          <p>A recent Economist/YouGov survey reveals President Donald Trump's disapproval rating has reached a record high of 55% in his second term, contrasting with 41% approval. This significant increase from the prior week's figures is largely attributed to a notable decline in support among Democrats and independents, with Democratic approval dropping from 12% to 3% since January. The poll also indicates that a substantial 59% of Trump's 2024 voters believe the government is concealing evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This suggests that the ongoing Epstein controversy, particularly the perceived lack of transparency, may be contributing to his declining favorability, even among segments of his loyal base.</p>
