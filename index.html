          <p>Presenter and campaigner Katie Piper discussed her views on aging at the Hay Festival in Wales, comparing it to a form of bereavement.

          <p>Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have instructed VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This directive followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by two VA pulmonologists, warning that staff reductions jeopardize veterans' healthcare. Critics argue that this action represents censorship and a "war on science" by the Trump administration. The VA maintains that the policy simply requires employees to coordinate with public affairs staff, a practice common in many organizations.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers. Ukrainian security sources claim the operation, called "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derailed two trains in western Russia, resulting in casualties. The drone attack comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site, and both sides are preparing for another round of talks in Istanbul to explore prospects of a ceasefire.</p>
