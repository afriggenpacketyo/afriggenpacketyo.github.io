          <p>The Trump administration faces an August 1st deadline for implementing higher global tariffs, having secured only eight trade deals in 120 days, including with the UK, EU, and several Asian nations. Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and South Korea have agreed to reduced tariff rates and increased market access, though some details remain contentious. Meanwhile, key partners such as China, India, Canada, and Mexico have not reached agreements and face the prospect of significantly higher duties.

          <p>Ford has revised its financial outlook, now expecting U.S. tariffs to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year, a significant increase from previous estimates. The automaker has already incurred $800 million in extra duties in the last quarter, primarily due to prolonged higher levies on goods from Mexico and Canada, as well as tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, confirmed ongoing discussions with the White House to seek lower tariffs, particularly on vehicle parts. The announcement underscores the substantial financial impact of the administration's trade policies on major American corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a comprehensive trade deal, establishing a 15% blanket tariff on South Korean exports to the U.S., including key sectors like automobiles. As part of the agreement, South Korea has committed to a $350 billion investment in the U.S., though the two nations appear to have different interpretations of how these funds will be controlled and utilized. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive beef and rice markets from further U.S. access, critics note the deal negates benefits from their existing free trade agreement. The deal avoids a threatened 25% tariff, aligning South Korea's rate with Japan's. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twelve employees of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) are facing disciplinary action, including termination, following allegations of a wild retirement party held during work hours. The party, which took place at a Caltrans yard in Monterey, allegedly involved heavy drinking and a hired stripper. An anonymous tip also claimed that some supervisors drove state-issued vehicles while intoxicated after the event. Caltrans has placed the employees on leave and launched a full investigation, stating the alleged behavior is a serious violation of its ethical standards.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused concern when he left the mound with a trainer during the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds. The team later announced the early exit was due to cramping, a relatively minor issue that alleviated initial fears of a more serious injury. Ohtani was able to remain in the game as a designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-2. The incident occurred on a hot and humid night, and manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the injury was not severe, expecting Ohtani to make his next start.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting public pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though in an unusual move, two board members dissented, favoring a rate reduction. The decision comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain economic effects of the administration's tariffs and recent data showing moderated growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated a cautious approach is warranted, as the full impact of tariffs on inflation and growth is not yet clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Russia, this article explains the science of how tsunamis are generated and what risks they pose. A tsunami requires a strong undersea earthquake, typically magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes vertical displacement of the seafloor, creating powerful waves that can travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean. As these waves approach shallow coastal areas, they slow down and increase dramatically in height, becoming incredibly destructive. The article provides safety advice, emphasizing that people should immediately move to higher ground upon receiving a warning, as the waves are too fast to outrun.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has captured unprecedented images of abundant life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team discovered what they describe as thriving communities of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, in a pitch-black environment under immense pressure. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings challenge previous assumptions about life's limits and suggest such "chemosynthetic" ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

          <p>The impact of screen time on children's development remains a contentious topic, with some scientists arguing that concrete evidence of widespread harm is lacking. This article explores the debate, noting that while many parents and some experts worry about negative effects on mental health and sleep, other researchers point to flaws in existing studies, such as reliance on self-reporting. These academics argue that the term "screen time" is too broad and fails to distinguish between different types of online activity. While the debate continues, there is no scientific consensus, leaving parents with inconsistent guidance on managing their children's technology use.</p>
