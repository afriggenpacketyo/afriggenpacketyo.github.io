          <p>Scottie Scheffler won his first Open Championship at Royal Portrush, finishing four shots clear of the competition. The world number one golfer established a commanding lead early in the final round, effectively ending the suspense and securing his fourth major title. This victory, his second major of the year, adds to growing comparisons with Tiger Woods, as Scheffler now only needs the US Open to complete a career Grand Slam. The win came despite hometown favorite Rory McIlroy's emotional finish before a supportive crowd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, has stated he will continue to permit agents to wear masks during arrest operations. While acknowledging he is not a proponent of the practice and understands concerns about imposters, Lyons cited an 830% increase in assaults on officers as justification for the safety measure. The policy has drawn criticism from legal advocates and state attorneys general, who argue it undermines accountability and transparency. Critics point to the climate of fear it creates and the potential for criminals to pose as federal agents.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that the Trump administration is on the verge of securing major trade agreements, calling the next two weeks crucial for delivering on economic promises. Lutnick stated that an August 1 deadline for imposing higher tariffs on key trading partners, including the European Union, is firm, pushing countries to either open their markets or face penalties. He also defended the administration's tariff strategy against criticism, arguing it will ultimately benefit American manufacturers.

Both teams changed their names in recent years following long-standing criticism that the previous monikers were racially insensitive.

This trend is particularly noticeable in roles related to content, customer service, and HR.

          <p>The family of an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, Luis Leon, reports he was secretly deported after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Leon, who was granted U.S. asylum in 1987, was taken into custody by ICE in June without explanation. His family was unable to locate him and was later falsely told he had died, only to discover from a relative that he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no ties. The case highlights the severe and confusing outcomes of current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man drove a car into a crowd of people outside a Hollywood nightclub early Saturday, injuring 30 people, at least five of whom are in critical condition. The incident occurred as people were lined up to enter The Vermont Hollywood. The driver, identified as Fernando Ramirez, also struck a taco truck and a valet stand before being apprehended by witnesses. During the struggle, Ramirez was shot before he fled the scene on foot; he is now in custody and faces potential attempted murder charges. The investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department is ongoing.</p>

          <p>David Litt, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, argues that finding "neutral ground" is more important than searching for "common ground" in a divided America. In his new book, Litt describes how learning to surf with his politically opposite brother-in-law allowed them to build a friendship despite their disagreements on major issues. He suggests that focusing on a shared activity, rather than forcing political consensus, can foster mutual respect and lead to more genuine discussions. This approach, he believes, allows people to connect as humans first, making it possible to disagree without being disagreeable.</p>

          <p>A performer at London's Royal Opera House staged a protest on Saturday night by unfurling a large Palestinian flag during the curtain call for the opera "Il trovatore." Video of the incident shows a brief struggle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to take the flag from the cast member. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the act as a "spontaneous and unauthorised action," stating it was inappropriate and violated their commitment to political impartiality. The protest, which drew a mixed reaction from the audience, brought the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas onto one of London's most prestigious stages.</p>

          <p>A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia prompted the temporary closure of all major airports in Moscow, causing significant travel disruption. Russia's defense ministry reported downing over 230 drones since Saturday, with 27 intercepted over the capital region alone. The attacks led to the cancellation or redirection of more than 270 flights. Meanwhile, Russian air strikes in Ukraine killed at least three people overnight. The escalating cross-border attacks come as both nations signal a potential, though highly fragile, willingness to consider a path toward a peace settlement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill for a child's lifelong success is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. She argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this crucial skill, parents should validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build genuine resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence that protects mental health into adulthood.</p>

Kennedy Jr. The article refutes claims that children receive 92 mandatory shots, that only COVID-19 vaccines were tested against placebos, and that vaccine advisory committees have pervasive financial conflicts of interest. Citing extensive data, the author explains that the childhood vaccine schedule is safe, all routine vaccines have undergone rigorous placebo-controlled trials, and robust surveillance systems continuously monitor for adverse events. The piece aims to counter misinformation with established scientific evidence.</p>

This development follows stabilizing efforts in U.S.-China relations, including a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats and a preliminary trade deal.

          <p>An opinion article argues that traditional methods for measuring the U.S. labor market, such as jobs reports and unemployment rates, are becoming obsolete. With the rise of the "gig economy," remote work, and "over-employed" individuals holding multiple jobs or side hustles, simply counting jobs no longer provides an accurate picture of economic health. The author suggests a shift towards measuring income, proposing a metric that tracks the percentage of the population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold from all sources. This, the article contends, would offer a more relevant understanding of the modern workforce.</p>

Once a bustling stop, the town withered after being bypassed by a new interstate in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and restoration projects to attract the thousands of tourists expected to travel the route for the centennial. They hope the anniversary will breathe new life into their community, which they see as a slice of Americana "frozen in time."</p>

The school was closed on Friday as the community left tributes and mourned the loss.

His death has not only prompted tributes from around the world but also cast a spotlight on India's notoriously dangerous roads, where over 150,000 people die annually.

Campaigners feel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not prioritizing a deal to release all remaining captives, pointing to stalled talks and the deaths of hostages who could have been freed earlier. Many now place more hope in U.S. pressure to force a deal, believing that far-right elements in the Israeli coalition are prioritizing land over human life. This sentiment reflects a deep-seated fear that the national ethos of "leaving no one behind" is being abandoned.</p>
