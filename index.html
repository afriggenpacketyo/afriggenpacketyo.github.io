          <p>Senior Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, leader of New York's Central Synagogue and the first Asian American woman to hold such a position, champions "radical compassion" as the essence of true faith. Her perspective is deeply informed by her personal journey as a Korean Jew, which cultivated a profound empathy for those feeling marginalized within various communities. Through her influential sermons and upcoming memoir, "Heart of a Stranger," she advocates for understanding and inclusion, drawing inspiration from a biblical message against oppressing outsiders. This article highlights her message's significant resonance amidst ongoing global conflicts like the Israel-Hamas war and rising antisemitism, stressing the importance of shared humanity and maintaining spiritual well-being.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly engaged in discussions with Japan and South Korea regarding a potential trilateral currency swap, aiming to bolster the region's financial safety net and deepen economic cooperation. This initiative, spearheaded by the People’s Bank of China governor, seeks to reduce reliance on the US dollar and promote a free trade deal among the three East Asian nations. The talks are set against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s ongoing tariff war, which has impacted all three countries. The proposed swap would provide crucial local currency liquidity and offer financial relief during potential debt crises, signifying a strategic move towards enhanced regional economic resilience and stability.

          <h2>Beyond Meat Stock Experiences Significant Surge Following Meme ETF Inclusion</h2>

          <p>Beyond Meat, a company once considered a penny stock, experienced a dramatic surge in its share price, jumping 60% on Tuesday and over 127% for the week. This significant rally was catalyzed by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and the announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart across the U.S. Market analysts suggest that the sudden spike is largely attributable to a short squeeze, compelling investors who had bet against the stock to rapidly cover their positions. This remarkable turnaround for the plant-based meat alternative company, after years of declining value, is being interpreted by some as a potential signal of a frothy and speculative market environment.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was presented with the Architect of Peace Award by the Nixon Foundation during a ceremony held at the White House. This award, established in 1995, recognizes individuals who have significantly contributed to shaping a more peaceful world, aligning with the late President Richard Nixon's lifelong goal. Trump's reception of the honor was linked to his central role in brokering a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The article notes his public advocacy for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and his administration's criticism of the Nobel committee's choice for a different recipient, highlighting his desire for recognition in global conflict resolution.</p>

          <p>U.S. cattle ranchers express strong concerns over President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina, viewing it as a threat to the domestic food supply and an inadequate solution to high beef prices. The industry is already grappling with the potential resurgence of the screwworm parasite from the Mexican border and reduced herd sizes due to drought. Ranchers, like James Clement III, argue that government intervention distorts markets and that focus should be on biosecurity and disease prevention. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association also urged Trump to allow market forces to work, warning of harm to rural America and potential health risks from Argentina's history of foot-and-mouth disease.

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind Ozempic and Wegovy, is undergoing a significant boardroom shake-up, with seven board members, including the chairman, stepping down. This exodus stems from a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder, the non-profit Novo Nordisk Foundation, over the extent of necessary governance changes. The foundation, holding substantial voting rights, reportedly pushed for a more extensive reconfiguration, believing the company was "too slow in recognising fundamental market changes." This follows a recent CEO change, staff layoffs, and a profit warning due to increased competition, collectively impacting the company's valuation and strategic direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm in the Atlantic this year, has formed in the Caribbean, according to the National Hurricane Center. While not expected to significantly impact the mainland United States, its path and intensity remain uncertain. The storm, currently south of Haiti with 50 mph winds, is projected to gradually turn north-northwest and may stall near Haiti and Jamaica, potentially strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane. A hurricane watch is issued for Haiti's southern coast, with risks of heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and landslides for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, requiring residents to complete preparations by Thursday.</p>

          <p>Dr. Jon LaPook, CBS News chief medical correspondent, discusses the fitness trend of using weighted vests to intensify workouts, outlining both potential benefits and risks. While weighted vests can aid in burning more calories and improving heart workload, caution is advised, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions, who should consult a doctor. The article notes inconclusive studies on bone health benefits but suggests they may help prevent falls by strengthening muscles, provided the vest itself doesn't cause imbalance. Proper fit and starting with a low weight (5% of body weight) are crucial to avoid joint stress and injury, emphasizing safety over rapid progression.</p>

The $250 million project, financed by Trump and private donors, has drawn criticism, with some labeling it a "disgrace" and a symbol of a "Second Gilded Age."

          <p>This article challenges the notion that wealthier mothers are the unhappiest, presenting a nuanced view of parental well-being across socioeconomic levels. While some research suggests higher-income mothers experience unique stressors, broader data indicates that increased income and education generally correlate with greater parental happiness and life satisfaction. The article highlights that highly educated mothers may spend more time on "developmentally stimulating" activities, which they paradoxically enjoy less. Ultimately, the article concludes that parental feelings are complex and that all parents, regardless of income, would benefit from more robust family-friendly policies and a stronger social safety net, as evidenced by better outcomes in family-friendly Nordic countries.</p>
