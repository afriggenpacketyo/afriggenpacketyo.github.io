          <p>Donald Trump's administration has faced legal challenges over its attacks on the media, including attempts to defund Voice of America and bar reporters from the Oval Office. Courts have sometimes sided with media outlets, citing First Amendment protections, but experts warn that these freedoms require constant defense. Trump has also signed executive orders targeting law firms deemed 'risks,' potentially chilling legal challenges to free speech violations. His administration is also expected to introduce a memo to block federal funding for NPR and CBS, aligning with his strategy of controlling the public narrative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to benefit wildlife, with migratory birds arriving and butterflies emerging earlier than usual. The British Trust for Ornithology notes that milder winters and wetter springs are contributing to changes in the natural world. However, the warm weather also increases the risk of wildfires, particularly in heathlands, posing a threat to rare species. Wildlife charities urge people to be cautious and avoid starting fires during this dry period, especially in vulnerable areas.</p>

          <p>Several boxing experts have shared their predictions for the upcoming fight between Eubank and Benn. Opinions vary, with some favoring Eubank due to his experience, size, and weight advantage, anticipating a late-round stoppage or a points victory. Others, like Adam Azim, believe Benn's youth and power will lead to a knockout. The weight factor is a significant point of contention, with Benn moving up two weight classes to face Eubank.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, pleaded not guilty as supporters rallied outside the New York City courthouse.
