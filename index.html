          <h2>Researchers Raise Concerns as More Teenagers Use AI for Companionship and Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 20:28:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media reveals a growing trend of teenagers using AI chatbots for friendship, advice, and emotional support. Over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many finding these interactions as satisfying as talking to real friends. Researchers and parents express concern that this reliance on AI could hinder the development of crucial social skills, critical thinking, and emotional resilience, potentially exacerbating youth mental health issues by replacing human connection with constant, uncritical validation from algorithms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The panel of judges found that the order directly contradicts the clear language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to "all persons born in the United States." This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the policy, which sought to deny citizenship to many children of undocumented immigrants, though the policy is currently on hold.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first six months of the Trump administration's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported nearly 150,000 individuals, a rate that could exceed 300,000 annually. This would mark the highest number of deportations since the Obama administration in 2014, driven by a sweeping mandate and expanded enforcement categories. Despite the significant increase, this figure still falls short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational challenges of such a large-scale effort.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to issue a subpoena compelling the Justice Department to release its files on the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion passed with bipartisan support, as three Republican members joined Democrats in demanding transparency, defying their party's leadership. The move for greater disclosure intensifies as the committee also subpoenaed Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, for a deposition, reflecting growing public and political pressure for accountability in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in Florida. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the request did not meet the strict legal requirements for breaching grand jury secrecy, stating her "hands are tied" by precedent. This decision is a setback for those demanding full transparency in the case, although separate requests to unseal records in New York are still pending.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against conservative influencer Candace Owens. The suit alleges that Owens has spread false and defamatory fictions, most notably the baseless conspiracy theory that the first lady was born male. Owens has repeatedly promoted the claim on her popular podcast and social media channels, and the lawsuit states it was filed after she refused requests for a retraction.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump's public pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not about monetary policy, but a dangerous power play. The author contends that forcing the central bank to lower interest rates to accommodate government borrowing is a classic case of "fiscal dominance," which historically leads to inflation and economic instability. The piece asserts that the real issue is excessive government spending, not the Fed's interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
