          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have initiated a daily "tactical pause" in military operations in specific areas of Gaza to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid. This suspension of activity, scheduled daily until further notice, is intended to create secure corridors for the United Nations and other international groups to distribute essential food and medicine. The decision comes amid growing international pressure to address the worsening malnutrition crisis within the enclave. These new procedures aim to ensure aid convoys can move safely within the Strip.</p>

          <p>Former ballerina Ashley Benefield was convicted of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, a case marked by a turbulent relationship and competing narratives of abuse and manipulation. The trial, which concluded in the summer of 2024, featured Ashley claiming self-defense after years of alleged emotional abuse, while prosecutors argued she killed Doug to secure sole custody of their daughter. Key evidence included the couple's volatile history, which involved a prior incident of Doug firing a gun, and Ashley's numerous unsubstantiated allegations against him, including poisoning. She was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>The ongoing war in Ukraine faces growing uncertainty as global attention shifts and both nations feel increasingly isolated. President Trump has introduced a new dynamic by giving Russia a 50-day deadline to agree to a peace deal or face severe secondary sanctions, a threat analysts are skeptical will sway Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, Ukraine is grappling with internal challenges, including concerns over President Zelenskyy's consolidation of power and anti-corruption efforts, which could affect crucial international support. This complex situation leaves the prospects for a near-term resolution to the conflict looking bleak.</p>

          <p>A social media account on X, claiming affiliation with Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, has made provocative allegations that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is frequently under the influence of drugs. The Farsi-language account has posted several messages mocking Khamenei's leadership and highlighting Iran's domestic issues like water and electricity shortages. While the Mossad has not officially confirmed its connection to the account, some intelligence experts believe it to be authentic based on the nature of the information shared. These claims echo previous, unverified accusations from other sources regarding the Ayatollah's alleged substance use.</p>

Experts and activists are calling for urgent reforms, including integrating mental health education into school curricula, training teachers to support students, and creating systemic "safety nets" for vulnerable individuals.

This official unease highlights the sensitivity of women's rights in China, where the government promotes traditional gender roles and cracks down on feminist activism.

Kershaw struggled with his command, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth before exiting. The Dodgers' efforts were also hampered by several runners being thrown out on the basepaths, squandering opportunities to rally.</p>

          <p>Greece is currently fighting five major wildfires across the country, prompting the evacuation of residents in a region just north of Athens as a severe heatwave continues. The blazes, fanned by high winds and temperatures forecast to reach 44°C (111°F), have destroyed homes and forest areas. A fire that began in Afidnes spread rapidly through several communities, and though the main front is contained, hotspots persist. Greece has requested additional firefighting aircraft from the European Union to help combat the emergencies unfolding in Attica, Evia, Kythira, and other regions.</p>

          <h2>China Designates 'Drone Flight Planner' as New Occupation Amid Low-Altitude Economy Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 22:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reflecting the rapid growth of its low-altitude economy, China's government has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new profession. The role involves planning flight paths, developing missions, and managing on-site operations for multiple drones. This move comes as Beijing identifies the low-altitude sector, which includes activities up to 1,000 meters, as a strategic emerging industry poised to drive economic growth and innovation. The Ministry of Human Resources stated that these new tech-focused roles are attracting many creative young people to the burgeoning field.</p>

          <h2>Nearly 4,000 NASA Employees to Depart Agency Under Deferred Resignation Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 21:35:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of the agency's workforce, have chosen to leave through a deferred resignation program offered by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and will see NASA's employee count drop from 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the administration has also proposed significant budget cuts for the space agency, although recent legislation has allocated additional long-term funding for key missions. The full impact of the workforce reduction on NASA's operations remains unclear.</p>
