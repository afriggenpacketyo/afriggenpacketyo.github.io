          <p>Federal officials announced charges against a 45-year-old Iraqi man for allegedly voting illegally in the 2020 presidential election, with assistance from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Akeel Abdul Jamiel, residing in South Glens Falls, N.Y., is accused of voting despite not being a U.S. citizen. DOGE's role in the investigation remains undisclosed, but this case marks the first publicly acknowledged instance of the unit's involvement leading to charges. Jamiel had registered as a member of the Conservative Party shortly before the election, marking his first known voter registration in the United States since living there from 2005.</p>

          <p>A California bill aimed at combating child sexual assault trafficking has been significantly altered, with the removal of a provision that would have charged buyers of 16 and 17-year-old victims with a felony. Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, the bill's author, reluctantly agreed to the change to ensure the legislation could proceed, expressing her strong disagreement with the amendment. Republicans criticized Democrats for weakening the bill, arguing that it fails to adequately protect children. The bill still includes provisions criminalizing those loitering to buy teenagers for sex and establishes a fund to support victims.</p>

          <p>Patrick Vereb, a Pittsburgh funeral home director, faces charges for allegedly throwing out the bodies of thousands of pets and providing owners with ashes from other animals. Vereb, owner of Vereb Funeral Home and Eternity Pet Memorial, is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers between 2021 and 2024.
