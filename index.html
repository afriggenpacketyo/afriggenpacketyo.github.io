          <h2>UK Inflation Slows to 2.8% in February</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation eased to 2.8% in February, slightly below analyst expectations.  This decrease is attributed to factors like lower clothing and footwear prices, but the Bank of England anticipates a temporary rise to 3.7% in the third quarter due to rising energy costs.  Global trade uncertainties also contribute to economic uncertainty.</p>
