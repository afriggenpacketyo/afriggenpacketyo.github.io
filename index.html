          <p>President Trump plans to announce "Liberation Day," a significant import tax increase using reciprocal tariffs.  These tariffs aim to match taxes imposed by other countries on US imports, potentially boosting domestic manufacturers. However, economists warn of administrative complexity and potential negative impacts on global commerce and US consumer prices.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin and Florida special elections offer potential insights into the strategies Democrats and Republicans may employ in the upcoming midterm elections.  The Democratic victory in Wisconsin, fueled by criticism of Elon Musk's involvement, suggests a potential playbook for Democrats.  While Republicans won in Florida, narrower margins than in previous elections suggest increased challenges in traditionally Republican strongholds.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case challenging South Carolina's attempt to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements.  The state argues that any funding to Planned Parenthood indirectly supports abortions, despite federal law prohibiting Medicaid coverage for most abortions.
