          <p>Pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced the closure of all its stores, following multiple bankruptcy filings over the past two years. The company, founded in 1962, had been struggling with declining sales and significant opioid-related lawsuits, including a Justice Department complaint for allegedly filling unlawful prescriptions. Over 520 locations had already closed since October 2023, representing a quarter of its stores at the time of its initial bankruptcy filing. The company's website now directs former customers to find new pharmacies and request their records.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš has won the Czech parliamentary election, marking a significant political comeback. His ANO movement secured 35% of the vote, defeating the pro-Western coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. This outcome suggests a shift in the country's foreign policy, potentially moving away from supporting Ukraine and aligning more with pro-Russian stances seen in Hungary and Slovakia. Babiš's victory could lead to a new government with anti-migrant and right-wing partners.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly offering unaccompanied migrant children aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily leave the United States. This initiative, which excludes Mexican minors, is part of President Trump’s broader campaign promise for a large-scale domestic deportation operation. While officials frame it as a voluntary option to return home, immigration advocates warn it undermines due process and could expose children to renewed trafficking risks. The program aims to reduce costs associated with arrests, detentions, and deportations.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury Department is reportedly considering a $1 coin design to commemorate America's 250th anniversary, featuring Donald Trump with a clenched fist and the phrase "fight, fight, fight." This phrase references Trump's reaction after an assassination attempt last year. While a draft design was shared by US Treasurer Brandon Beach, the Treasury Department clarified it is not the final version. The coin program typically funds monuments and historical sites, but Trump's plummeting approval ratings and criticism over his administration's policies add controversy to the proposal.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has brought heavy rain and strong winds across large parts of the UK, causing significant damage and disruption. An amber wind warning remains in place for northern Scotland, where gusts reached 96mph in some areas, leaving nearly 50,000 homes without power. The storm also led to widespread cancellations on rail and ferry networks, and tragically, one man died in the Republic of Ireland in a weather-related incident. London's royal parks were closed, and the storm set a new record for the deepest low pressure in the UK for October.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest U.S. Lutheran denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. This historic appointment, succeeding the first woman to lead the ELCA, marks a significant moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry's six-year term began October 1st, and he hopes his presence will inspire greater diversity within the church. The ELCA, which has seen membership declines, has also embraced LGBTQ+ inclusion in recent years.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested at least 355 people in central London during protests supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. The demonstrations proceeded despite calls from ministers and police to postpone them following a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester.

Amnesty International UK condemned the arrests, arguing they breach human rights obligations.</p>

          <p>Amid a government shutdown, Democrats are refuting Republican claims that their spending plan would provide "free healthcare for illegals." Democratic leaders, including Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, emphasize that federal law prohibits such coverage for undocumented immigrants, except for emergency Medicaid. The Democratic funding patch instead seeks to reverse Medicaid cuts and allow lawfully present noncitizens, like refugees, to access federal health programs. Republicans, however, use immigration as a political leverage point, shifting focus away from healthcare provisions.</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly being considered for a leading role on a "Board of Peace" to govern Gaza post-ceasefire, as part of President Trump's peace plan. This potential appointment has drawn significant criticism in the region and internationally, given Blair's controversial history, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq War. Palestinians and human rights advocates argue against his involvement, citing his past failures as a Middle East envoy and perceived pro-Israel stance. Blair himself described the Trump plan as "bold and intelligent."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has concluded that the Department of Justice's prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges might be illegal retaliation. This comes after Ábrego successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation to El Salvador. The judge cited statements by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and the timing of the charges as evidence suggesting vindictive prosecution. Ábrego, who has an American family, has faced a relentless public relations campaign from the Trump administration, labeling him a gang member despite no convictions.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns, heavily reliant on international students, are facing severe economic consequences due to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The number of international students at institutions like Miami University has plummeted, leading to significant financial losses for universities and local businesses. Stricter screening, visa revocations, and fear of deportation, alongside previous tariffs and the pandemic, contribute to this decline. Experts warn that cutting off international student visas, coupled with demographic shifts, could lead to chaos and even school closures in less affluent towns.</p>
