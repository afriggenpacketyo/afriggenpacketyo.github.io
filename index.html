          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates, marking the first time since 2014 it has missed on both metrics. Despite this, the home improvement retailer reaffirmed its full-year forecast, anticipating 2.8% total sales growth. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects, but saw encouraging signs with a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could spur more homebuying and renovation activity. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Pew Research survey indicates nearly half of Americans believe public behavior has become more impolite since the pandemic, sparking a debate about a potential crisis of rudeness. Experts suggest this perceived decline in civility may be linked to a 'crisis of attention,' as constant screen time makes people less aware of their impact on others. Stress and feeling overwhelmed are also cited as major contributors to impolite behavior. While the definition of rudeness varies across generations and cultures, its effects are tangible, leading to poor moods, decreased cooperation, and a contagious cycle of incivility. The article explores these dynamics and offers advice on fostering more respectful interactions.</p>

          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5km away to protect it from ground subsidence caused by an adjacent iron ore mine. The massive 672-tonne structure was lifted onto giant trailers for the slow, two-day journey through the Arctic city, an event that drew large crowds of locals and tourists. This delicate operation is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center, which has been undermined by over a century of mining activity. The church's interior treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, remain inside during the move, carefully stabilized for protection.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Washington, Western allies are considering the possibility of direct talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. US President Trump indicated he would help arrange such a meeting, while also pledging security guarantees for Ukraine, with European nations expected to bear much of the responsibility. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the need for thorough preparations and a ceasefire, a sentiment echoed by other European leaders who remain cautious about Russia's willingness to negotiate in good faith. The discussions represent a significant diplomatic push to find a resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>British singer Tom Grennan has revealed he is in therapy for body dysmorphia, a mental health condition where individuals obsess over perceived flaws in their appearance. Speaking on a BBC podcast, the 30-year-old artist described himself as his own "biggest critic," constantly feeling he is larger than he is and experiencing guilt after eating binges. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can severely impact a person's life, leading to excessive worry and comparison with others. By sharing his experience, Grennan aims to raise awareness and emphasize how therapy is helping him to practice self-love and develop a healthier mindset.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to reverse the EPA's 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, a move that would eliminate the legal basis for federal climate regulations. While some companies have long opposed stringent environmental rules, many major industry groups are concerned that this repeal would create regulatory chaos and unpredictability for long-term investments. Proponents of federal standards argue they shield businesses from a patchwork of state laws and climate-related lawsuits. The potential reversal could remove a key legal defense for fossil fuel companies facing litigation from states and cities over climate change damages, inviting further legal challenges.</p>

          <p>German authorities are cracking down on various criminal activities, with recent police actions targeting motorcycle gangs and a severely intoxicated driver. Large-scale raids were conducted across three states to gather evidence against regional biker gangs suspected of extortion. In a separate incident on the autobahn, police arrested a driver whose blood-alcohol level was an acutely life-threatening 4.16 g/L after being clocked driving at speeds up to 220 kph (137 mph). These events coincide with ongoing trials for members of the far-right Reichsbürger movement and a former far-left terrorist, highlighting a broad spectrum of law enforcement challenges in the country.</p>

          <p>Gun violence has surged since the pandemic, with Black communities, particularly in rural areas like Bogalusa, Louisiana, bearing the heaviest burden. Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children, and young Black men are disproportionately affected, highlighting a severe public health crisis. This examination reveals that while families suffer, the Trump administration is actively rolling back federal efforts aimed at gun violence prevention, including weakening oversight of gun dealers and cutting funding for intervention programs. Critics argue these policy reversals undermine safety in communities already damaged by systemic disinvestment and racial discrimination, potentially leading to more preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>The debate over crime in Washington, D.C., has intensified, with President Trump and Mayor Muriel Bowser using different statistical goalposts to support their arguments. While the White House highlights that the 2024 homicide rate was nearly double that of 2012, the mayor points out that violent crime has significantly declined from its 2023 spike and is at a 30-year low. Experts caution that interpreting crime data requires careful consideration of the time frame, as different periods can tell different stories. While D.C. does have a chronic issue with violent crime, its rates are not the worst among similarly sized U.S. cities, and the data, despite potential manipulation allegations, shows a clear downward trend in 2024 and 2025.</p>

The musical's creators emphasize the importance of staging the production now, viewing it as a counternarrative to the currents of hatred in America.

In response, major school districts like Los Angeles and Chicago have implemented new protections, such as prohibiting ICE agents from school grounds without a criminal warrant, to create safe spaces for their students. Educators report that the climate of fear has led to increased student absenteeism and even families unenrolling their children from school to avoid potential detention.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a plan to take a 10% equity stake in Intel, which would make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The proposal involves potentially converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS Act into equity. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the struggling American semiconductor company, which has fallen behind global competitors, and to build government-backed national champions in strategic industries. The discussions are still preliminary, but they follow SoftBank's recent $2 billion investment and highlight Washington's growing interest in securing the domestic chip supply chain.

          <p>Helsinki has become one of the largest cities to record zero traffic fatalities in the past year, a success attributed to a comprehensive road safety strategy. A key measure has been the reduction of speed limits to 30 km/h (about 19 mph) on more than half of the city's streets, particularly around schools. As part of the EU's "Vision Zero" initiative, the Finnish capital has also focused on redesigning infrastructure to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, improving public transport, and using data to identify and eliminate accident blackspots. Enhanced speed enforcement, with 60 fixed cameras, has also been crucial in changing driver behavior and making the city's streets safer for everyone.</p>

          <p>Air Canada's flight attendants have ended their strike after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline early Tuesday morning. The walkout, which began over the weekend, disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The union had previously defied two back-to-work orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, protesting the government's use of legislation that curtails the right to strike. The breakthrough came after a late-night negotiating session assisted by a mediator, allowing for the full resumption of the carrier's operations.</p>

Bates was convicted of abducting White from her workplace, attempting to sexually assault her in nearby woods, and then stabbing her to death before stealing her ring. His lawyers have filed multiple last-minute appeals, including a federal lawsuit claiming Governor Ron DeSantis's process for signing death warrants is discriminatory, but these have so far been dismissed by the courts. If the execution proceeds, it will be the 10th carried out in Florida in 2025, with two more planned in the coming month.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic visit to New Delhi, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for a shared vision of partnership and mutual respect with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. The meeting aimed to consolidate the improving momentum in China-India relations, which had plummeted after a 2020 border conflict. Wang emphasized that both nations should focus their resources on development and cooperation rather than disputes. As a sign of progress, China has reportedly promised to address India's concerns regarding the supply of key materials such as rare earths, fertilizers, and tunnel boring machines, signaling a move towards resolving economic and trade issues between the two Asian powers.</p>

A move back to China could be a strategic bid to align with Chinese authorities, although it comes as the company faces increasing policy headwinds in Western markets, including the removal of a key U.S. tariff exemption that helped keep its prices low.

The 1943 wooden carving, which had been in private ownership, was placed under a temporary export ban due to its national importance, giving the gallery a chance to acquire it. The fundraising campaign received widespread support, including over 2,800 public donations and major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund. The sculpture will now go on permanent public display in the artist's home city of Wakefield, with plans to lend it to other UK museums.</p>

In response, Beijing has initiated several campaigns to support jobless graduates, offering services like career guidance, job referrals, and training opportunities.

          <p>This opinion article argues that recent diplomatic developments, including President Trump's U-turn on demanding an immediate ceasefire and more severe sanctions against Russia, have moved the conflict further from a peaceful resolution. The author contends that Russian President Vladimir Putin will only relent under maximum pressure, which has now been lessened. Furthermore, there is concern that allies are implicitly pressuring Ukraine to cede territory in exchange for vague security guarantees from a U.S. administration known for its unpredictability. The piece concludes that while the diplomatic meetings may serve political optics, they risk playing into Russia's hands and delaying a genuine peace.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on the complex challenge of being advised to adopt a healthier diet for high cholesterol after spending years unlearning the restrictive mindset of anorexia. The experience highlights a societal paradox where health is often conflated with weight loss, and tools designed to promote wellness, like calorie-counting apps, can inadvertently trigger disordered eating patterns. The author critiques the reductive health messaging that focuses on calories over nutrition and fails to consider patients' mental health histories. This journey forces a confrontation with her own identity post-recovery and the contradictory societal pressures surrounding food, health, and body image.</p>
