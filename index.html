        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Rifle Association and other gun rights organizations have initiated a lawsuit challenging a new California law that bans certain Glock-style semi-automatic firearms. This legislation targets pistols with a "cruciform trigger bar," a component that facilitates their conversion into illegal machine guns using an attachment known as a "switch." The plaintiffs argue that the law infringes upon Second Amendment rights by prohibiting widely used handguns, which they contend are not inherently "dangerous and unusual." Conversely, Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, the bill's author, emphasized its aim to enhance public safety by curbing the proliferation of easily convertible automatic weapons.</p>

          <p>Prosecutor Maggie Cleary has been removed from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, marking further upheaval in a key Justice Department outpost. This office is notably overseeing charges against prominent figures like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both political adversaries of President Trump. Cleary's departure follows the recent resignation of former acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert and the firing of two other high-level prosecutors, raising concerns about the office's stability and potential political influence on its operations. The article highlights a memo circulated within the office that had argued against charging Comey, adding context to the ongoing changes.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a garment factory in Dhaka's Mirpur area, Bangladesh, has tragically claimed the lives of at least 16 individuals, with officials warning the death toll could still increase. The recovered bodies were burned beyond recognition, prompting distraught relatives to gather outside the four-story factory in search of their missing loved ones. The initial blaze was extinguished after three hours, but an adjacent chemical warehouse, reportedly storing highly flammable materials, continued to burn, exacerbating the situation. Authorities are actively investigating the incident, including the legality of the warehouse's operation, and are seeking to locate the owners of both facilities.</p>

Commanders from the 509th Bomb Wing, which operates these aircraft, described the 36-hour mission as a "perfect" performance, underscoring the B-2's critical role due to its unparalleled combination of long-range capability, high payload, and stealth technology. The mission involved delivering specialized 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, designed for deep underground targets, with F-22 and F-35 tactical fighters providing escort into Iranian airspace.

          <p>Instagram-parent Meta has announced new content settings for users under 18, aiming to align their online experience with PG-13 movie ratings to ensure age-appropriate content. These automatic protections, which are being rolled out and will be fully implemented by year-end, will default teen accounts to a 13+ setting, with parental permission required to opt out. The restrictions will block search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore" and prevent teens from following or interacting with accounts posting age-inappropriate content. Meta is also extending these regulations to its AI technology, seeking to reassure parents about online safety while providing them greater control over their teen's digital interactions.</p>

          <p>Hamas has returned the bodies of four additional deceased hostages, bringing the total repatriated to eight, amidst ongoing tensions surrounding the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in Gaza. This transfer occurred after Israel warned it would restrict aid into the territory until all 28 deceased hostages were returned, a key component of President Trump's peace plan. While all 20 living hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners were exchanged, the failure to repatriate the remaining 20 deceased hostages continues to be a major point of contention.

          <p>The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets, and lumber have officially taken effect, prompting economists to anticipate increased prices for consumers. These levies, which range from 10% to 50%, are ostensibly aimed at preventing foreign products from "flooding" the U.S. market and bolstering American manufacturing. Despite the administration's assertion that foreign exporters bear the costs, most economists, including those at Goldman Sachs, estimate that American consumers will ultimately absorb approximately 55% of these additional expenses. This article highlights concerns that these duties will likely elevate costs for individuals involved in home construction or remodeling, with recent inflation data already indicating substantial price increases across various furniture and household furnishing categories.

          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, a match significantly impacted by Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan's dismissal for headbutting Ireland midfielder Finn Azaz. Azaz described Barseghyan as having "lost his head," an incident that proved to be a turning point, granting Ireland a numerical advantage in the second half. Evan Ferguson's 70th-minute header ultimately broke the deadlock, earning Ireland their vital first win in the World Cup qualifying campaign. This article details the heated nature of the game, its positive impact on Ireland's Group F standings, and the team's renewed confidence as they prepare for upcoming decisive matches.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers in California and Hawaii have initiated a five-day strike, demanding increased salaries and solutions for chronic staffing shortages. Unions, including UNAC/UHCP, are seeking a 25% wage increase over four years to counter inflation and propose an internal registry of on-call nurses to reduce reliance on contract staff. Kaiser Permanente deems the strike "unnecessary and disruptive," calling the wage demands "out of step" and stating their 21.5% offer would already significantly raise payroll. The article highlights the company's plans to use temporary staff and volunteers to maintain care during the walkout, underscoring the ongoing dispute's impact on healthcare services.</p>

          <p>Indiana University has terminated Jim Rodenbush, its director of student media, amidst a heated dispute with university leadership regarding the content published in the student newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student (IDS). Rodenbush asserts his firing is a direct consequence of his commitment to defending the First Amendment rights of student journalists, as he resisted pressure to prohibit the publication of news. Student editors have vehemently condemned the termination as a "blatant attack" on press freedom, urging all students and staff to be concerned. The university, however, cites a strategic shift towards digital media and the publication's financial deficits as the reasons for Rodenbush's dismissal, while maintaining that editorial control remains with the IDS. This article highlights concerns from legal experts who categorize the university's attempts to influence content as "blatant censorship."</p>

          <p>OpenAI is executing an aggressive strategic pivot towards vertical integration, aiming to control every facet of its AI business, from chipmaking to consumer hardware. CEO Sam Altman's evolving vision, which initially prioritized algorithms, now heavily emphasizes scale, leading to a significant partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators optimized for its models. This strategic move, reminiscent of Apple's M-series chips, grants OpenAI deeper control over its infrastructure, further complemented by its acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, for developing AI-native devices. The article highlights OpenAI's ambitious "Stargate" campaign, involving massive investments with Nvidia and AMD, which is rapidly solidifying its position as a market leader and establishing ChatGPT as a foundational operating system for AI.</p>

          <p>Despite achieving record growth in renewable energy capacity last year, countries globally are not on track to meet their ambitious climate goals, according to an interim report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Although newly installed capacity reached approximately 582 gigawatts in 2024, representing a 15.1% increase over the previous year, this figure falls short of the targeted 16.6% yearly increase required to achieve the UN Climate Conference's objective of 11.2 terawatts by 2030. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized that the critical window to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is "rapidly closing."

          <p>The price of gold has reached a historic high of $4,000 an ounce, marking this year as its best since 1979, a period characterized by profound economic instability. This current "gold rush" is closely linked to widespread inflation, escalating geopolitical turmoil, and a weakening U.S. dollar, solidifying gold's traditional role as a safe-haven asset for investors. The article explains that "goldbugs," who are often skeptical of contemporary monetary policy, view gold as a crucial hedge against a potentially weakening dollar and rising national debt. The ongoing rally is also driven by central banks, particularly in emerging markets, increasing their gold reserves to insulate against future economic shocks potentially caused by U.S. policy.

          <p>New York prosecutors are seeking additional time to consider a potential third trial for Pedro Hernandez, who was convicted in the 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz, following an appeals court's order for a new trial or his release. The appeals court cited significant issues with Hernandez's police interrogation, his documented history of mental illness, and flawed jury instructions provided during his 2017 conviction. Defense lawyers are advocating for a swift decision and Hernandez's immediate release, asserting that an "innocent man is sitting in jail." Prosecutors, however, maintain the conviction was just and intend to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, while acknowledging challenges with older or deceased witnesses for any potential new trial.</p>
