        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prosecutors alleged that Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker, accused of conspiring to murder Monica's husband Fabio, continued their love affair in jail, using it as further evidence of their conspiracy. Police conducted elaborate sting operations, including undercover officers and recorded interactions in adjoining cells, to gather evidence. Intercepted love letters and coded phrases like "Ride or Die" were presented to show their commitment to each other and a "secrecy pact." Despite the defense arguing the affair was irrelevant to the murder, prosecutors successfully contended it demonstrated their shared motive and commitment to the crime, especially for financial gain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's comprehensive budget bill faces significant hurdles in the House of Representatives, despite narrowly passing the Senate. Fiscal conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus are concerned about the estimated $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over ten years, as projected by the CBO. Additionally, some Republicans from poorer districts oppose the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and other social programs, which could impact millions of low-income Americans. The president is actively lobbying holdouts to pass this defining legislation before the July 4th deadline, but opposition within his own party remains strong.</p>

          <p>Convicted killer Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of Fabio Sementilli, stated in an interview that his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, had no knowledge of the murder. Despite overwhelming circumstantial evidence presented by prosecutors, Baker maintains Monica's innocence. His unexpected plea change allowed Monica to be tried separately, a long-sought request by her defense. Baker's testimony, if given at Monica's upcoming trial, could be a significant development, though legal experts remain skeptical of its impact on a jury.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 stabbing death of her husband, Fabio Sementilli, a prominent beauty executive. Prosecutors argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, for financial gain and to be together, presenting evidence of a staged robbery, a secret affair, and suspicious phone activity. Despite Monica's defense claiming she was only guilty of infidelity and Baker's testimony attempting to exonerate her, the jury delivered a guilty verdict. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole and plans to appeal, bringing an end to the nearly eight-year legal saga.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed a halt in some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing a Defense Department review prioritizing America's military stockpiles. This decision, directed by President Trump, aims to ensure U.S. forces' readiness for defense priorities, following a broader Pentagon review of military aid to all recipient countries. The move comes after a previous temporary pause in military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine in early March, which was lifted after talks of a ceasefire. Despite the pause, the U.S. has provided tens of billions in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

The White House, under President Trump, has also asserted that Title IX mandates the protection of women's sports, threatening prosecution for violators.

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, nuclear proliferation experts warn that Iran's response could lead to a more dangerous and secretive pursuit of nuclear arms. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has signed a bill halting cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), effectively preventing outside monitoring of its nuclear program. This move, which the State Department calls "unacceptable," raises concerns about Iran potentially withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.

The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods trans-shipped through Vietnam, addressing concerns about Chinese products circumventing U.S. tariffs. This deal follows Trump's earlier "reciprocal" tariffs and aims to rebalance trade relationships, with Vietnam having become a major manufacturing hub for several global brands.</p>

While Kennedy argues for streamlining the program to combat fraud and serve the "neediest," the medical establishment warns that limiting access to care for the sickest Americans would undermine public health.

          <p>Conventional wisdom that the Sun Belt offers affordable housing alternatives to expensive coastal cities is being challenged by new trends. Research indicates that housing prices in cities like Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta have surged dramatically, outpacing traditional high-cost areas. This shift is attributed to restrictive zoning laws, similar to those on the coasts, which become more binding as sprawl limits are reached. The phenomenon of NIMBYism, where existing homeowners oppose new development, further exacerbates the issue. Policy changes, like those in Raleigh, North Carolina, are seen as crucial to prevent Sun Belt cities from mirroring California's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Saudi boxing power broker Turki Alalshikh has hinted that former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury could come out of retirement to fight in 2026. Fury, who retired in January after losing a rematch to Oleksandr Usyk, posted on Instagram, "Let's see what 2026 brings," alongside a photo with Alalshikh. While Alalshikh claims to have Fury's word for a Riyadh season fight, Fury recently expressed a desire for revenge against Usyk on home soil in England, or a major British fight against Anthony Joshua, indicating potential record-breaking bouts if he decides to return.</p>

          <h2>Trump Seeks $30 Billion for US Shipbuilding to Counter China, Faces Capacity Challenges</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to allocate $30 billion from a $150 billion defense reconciliation bill for naval shipbuilding, aiming to accelerate the U.S. fleet's growth to compete with China. This strategy also involves increasing shipbuilding cooperation with Indo-Pacific allies like South Korea and Japan. However, analysts warn that matching China's shipbuilding capacity within Trump's term will be challenging due to various factors, including the U.S. political priority of keeping jobs domestically. Despite the financial commitment, overcoming these hurdles to achieve naval parity will not be easy.</p>
