          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against making cuts to Medicaid as they debated a major tax bill. Speaking at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Trump's warning underscored the challenges in passing the tax bill, which was being held up by some Republicans seeking reductions in the Medicaid program, a health-care coverage initiative primarily for low-income individuals jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program cover nearly 80 million Americans. </p>

          <p>While accompanying President Trump on a trip to the Persian Gulf, Elon Musk and his family secured several lucrative deals, raising questions about conflicts of interest. SpaceX gained approval to provide Starlink satellite internet services in Saudi Arabia, while Neuralink announced a clinical trial in Abu Dhabi for its brain chip technology. Musk's companies have long-standing financial ties to the Gulf, including investments from government-linked funds. His brother Kimbal Musk's drone light show company also announced agreements with Qatar and Abu Dhabi.

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he plans to significantly decrease his political donations in the future, marking a shift from his substantial support for President Donald Trump's reelection efforts.

He did however leave the door open to future involvement if he sees a compelling reason.

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail was arrested for allegedly aiding 10 inmates in their escape. According to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, the worker, Sterling Williams, confessed to turning off the water supply to a cell after being instructed to do so by an inmate, facilitating the removal of a toilet and subsequent breach of the wall. Williams is charged with principle to simple escape and malfeasance in office. The escape occurred after inmates forced open a cell door and fled through a loading dock, highlighting security lapses at the facility.</p>

          <p>An inquest determined that the death of 11-year-old Kyra Hill, who drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire, was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety. The inquest revealed a lack of emergency plans, risk assessments, and warning signs about deep water, with depths reaching over 15 feet in some areas. The coroner stated that these failures, combined with poor water visibility, contributed to Kyra's death. Her father, Leonard Hill, is campaigning for stricter safety regulations at water parks following the tragic incident.</p>

The judge highlighted the ruthless exploitation of desperate individuals and the considerable risk to their lives, emphasizing that Ebid's primary motivation was financial gain. Ebid, who arrived in the UK in 2022 and applied for asylum, will likely be deported after serving his sentence.</p>

          <p>Potential ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia are again in the spotlight after a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the call, Trump said Ukraine and Russia would "immediately" begin negotiations towards a ceasefire. Putin was more reserved, saying Moscow is "ready to work" with the Ukrainians on a "memorandum on a possible future peace agreement defining a range of positions." The Trump administration has shown more willingness to work multilaterally, even if it has indicated it would back out of brokering peace if a solution is not found quickly.</p>

The pay rise had been agreed with another union, CCOO, but the Union Sindical Obrera successfully challenged the deal in court. Now, Ryanair is informing its members how much they owe and plans to deduct the money from their payslips. The union objects to the original agreement because those at the table negotiating were not authorised to do so for its members and legally couldn't sign that kind of agreement.</p>

Instead, he said that only Ukraine and Russia could resolve their differences.

          <p>Two new books analyze the Democratic Party's loss in the 2024 election, attributing it to a failure to address the concerns of working-class voters and a lack of clear identity beyond opposition to Trump. The books highlight internal divisions, strategic missteps, and the party's struggle to connect with voters on economic issues. One book emphasizes how the party's focus on "redistribution" policies alienates middle-income voters, while the other suggests that the party's elite leaders failed to accurately assess Biden's declining mental state. The article concludes that the Democrats must develop a stronger message and address economic anxieties to regain the support of the working class.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The gold-silver ratio, which compares the price of gold to silver, serves as a tool for precious metal investors to gauge relative value. A high ratio suggests silver may be undervalued, while a lower ratio indicates the opposite. Investors use this metric to inform decisions on whether to favor gold or silver investments. Currently, the gold-silver ratio is high, hovering around 100 to one, meaning it takes 100 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. While silver is more affordable, gold has historically been a stronger portfolio diversifier. (not investment advice)</p>
