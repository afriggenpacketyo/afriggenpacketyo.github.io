          <p>The article explains the differences between heat exhaustion and heat stroke, both of which are heat-related illnesses caused by overheating. Heat exhaustion is less severe, characterized by headache, fatigue, nausea, and cool skin, while heat stroke is a life-threatening condition with symptoms including impaired consciousness, seizures, and a rapid rise in body temperature. The article details immediate actions for both conditions, such as moving the affected person to a cool place, providing fluids, and cooling the body with cold cloths or ice baths. Prevention strategies include avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and wearing light-colored clothing. The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing symptoms early and seeking medical help when necessary. </p>

Moon advocates for peaceful protest but condemns property damage and looting, advising citizens to arm themselves for self-defense during social chaos. He criticizes Mayor Karen Bass for blaming President Trump for the unrest, which followed ICE sweeps targeting criminal illegal immigrants. </p>

          <p>Chinese military analysts are closely observing the US strikes on Iranian facilities, particularly the use of GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs. While acknowledging the success of the B-2 bomber's delivery and the bomb's performance, they also note its limitations, especially against deeply buried sites like Fordow. Mainland China is believed to have extensive underground bunker systems and its own bunker-busting weapons, as well as ambitions to target facilities within Taiwan. The analysts' assessment includes considerations for China's approach to developing its own arsenal for penetrating heavily fortified targets. </p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's proposed welfare reforms, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by Â£5 billion annually by 2030. Over 130 MPs, including 122 from Labour, have signed an amendment to block these changes, despite appeals from cabinet ministers to withdraw their support. While Labour leader Keir Starmer intends to proceed with the reforms, the widespread opposition indicates significant internal discord. Some cabinet members have expressed concern over the sour mood among MPs regarding this issue, fearing it could lead to broader problems for the Labour leadership. </p>

          <p>The government feared that victims of the Post Office scandal, who had not yet sought compensation, would feel harassed if officials actively encouraged them to apply. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters were still awaiting fair compensation. Despite paying out over Â£1 billion, the government has no plans to follow up with those eligible, after only one in five letters about restitution received a response. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) expressed concern that repeated letters could be perceived as harassment, though they agreed to consult the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board on the issue. </p>

Some scientists are perceived as excessively confident in supporting natural origins, while others highlight China's lack of transparency. The core issue is a crisis of trust, influenced by past controversies like gain-of-function research.

          <p>German police have initiated a crackdown on online hate speech, while former Health Minister Jens Spahn is set to face parliamentary questions regarding the government's acquisition of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spahn will be questioned about the high prices paid and the failure to accept or pay for the masks. Germany's government could potentially face payments of approximately â‚¬2.3 billion to health-product manufacturers due to lawsuits. The CDU/CSU bloc and the SPD are also requesting a parliamentary inquiry into the government's actions during the pandemic. </p>

          <p>China and India, major thermal coal importers, are reducing Indonesian shipments in favor of higher-energy-dense grades from other countries due to falling global prices. This shift is driven by the competitiveness of higher-calorific value (CV) coal, which yields more energy per ton. Mongolia and South Africa have benefited from this trend, increasing their coal exports to China and India, respectively. The overall coal imports to China and India have decreased, but Indonesian exports have been particularly affected by the shift to higher-grade coal. </p>
