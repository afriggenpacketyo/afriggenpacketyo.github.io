            <p>Following the government's takeover of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has avoided confirming whether the blast furnaces can continue running due to securing sufficient raw material supplies. Emergency legislation was swiftly passed to prevent the owners from shutting down the furnaces. Reynolds stated he wouldn't comment on the commercial aspect of supply but emphasized the takeover provides an opportunity to obtain the necessary coal. He acknowledged the situation remains challenging but insisted the legislation enables the government to maintain steel production in the UK, averting potential job losses.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is increasingly emphasizing his personal faith and belief in divine intervention, particularly following an assassination attempt last year. He asserts that his life was saved for a purpose, to make America great again, and that he feels a stronger connection to God. Trump often credits his Presbyterian upbringing for instilling his sense of morality and destiny, highlighting the importance of religion for the soul of the country. He advocates for religious liberty and links America's founding ideals directly to faith, believing he is fulfilling a divine mission.</p>

The camps, Zamzam and Abu Shouk, house over 700,000 people facing famine-like conditions. Relief International reported nine of its workers, including doctors, were killed in Zamzam. Residents describe catastrophic conditions with ongoing shelling and blocked escape routes, while the RSF denies responsibility and claims the atrocities were staged.

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is set for a retrial after a judge's misstep in the initial suit. The case stems from a 2017 editorial that Palin's attorneys argue falsely linked her to a 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona. Despite losing the initial trial, Palin has another opportunity due to jurors learning of the judge's decision to dismiss the case before they had finished deliberating. The retrial's outcome could impact press protections related to defamation claims by public figures.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's film *Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid* as a framework to critique the current political landscape, drawing parallels between the film's themes of American freedoms under attack and the rise of avaricious authoritarians. He suggests that Donald Trump's policies mirror the narcissistic notions of manifest destiny seen in the Old West, where the rights of individuals are sacrificed for the benefit of powerful interests. Lee connects the film's narrative to contemporary issues, such as political corruption, corporate greed, and the erosion of ethics in American politics.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, aimed at reforming voter registration, is facing scrutiny over its potential impact on married women's voting rights. The bill requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, potentially disenfranchising women who have changed their last names upon marriage and whose birth certificates no longer match their current legal names. While supporters claim the bill allows states to determine acceptable secondary documents, legal experts worry about inconsistent enforcement and the administrative burden on married women to obtain necessary documentation.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed a moss-based material that absorbs oil and repels water, offering a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to clean up oil spills. The absorbent, developed by researchers from Guizhou Education University, was made by treating the abundant plant material sphagnum moss with chemicals to alter its properties, resulting in an oil absorption capacity that outperformed conventional bio-based absorbents. This new material is a cheap and effective way to absorb oil from water, which could help the environment and the economy.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among consumers and businesses in the US. The rapid changes in tariffs have led to panic buying in some sectors and paralysis in others, as households struggle to keep up with potential price increases and shortages. The tariffs are expected to drive up the cost of clothing, electronics, and other imported goods, potentially impacting consumer spending and economic growth. Economists are warning of a possible recession if consumer spending declines significantly.</p>

            <p>Scientists at King's College London have successfully grown a human tooth under laboratory conditions, marking a significant advancement in regenerative dentistry. The breakthrough involves the use of a special material that enables cells to communicate with each other, mimicking the natural process of tooth development. While the technology is still years away from clinical application, it holds the potential to provide stronger, longer-lasting, and biologically compatible solutions for tooth replacement compared to implants or fillings.</p>
