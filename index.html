          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations after a 90-day pause on tariffs was agreed upon. Bessent emphasized that this agreement establishes a mechanism to avoid escalating tariff pressures between the U.S. and China. During the recent meeting in Switzerland, discussions also addressed the issue of fentanyl, with Bessent noting China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in curbing the flow of precursor drugs. This development follows a rally in global stock markets, reflecting optimism about the potential for a more comprehensive trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK court sentenced six Bulgarians to prison terms of up to 10 years for being part of a Russian espionage cell involved in surveillance and intelligence operations. The spies, motivated by money, targeted individuals and places of interest to the Russian state across the UK, Austria, Spain, Germany, and Montenegro. Their activities included planning potential abductions, using 'honeytraps,' and gathering mobile phone data of Ukrainian soldiers. The network was directed by an alleged Russian agent, Jan Marsalek, and the case exposed the inner workings of a sophisticated Russian spy cell operating on British soil.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status under a Trump administration plan has arrived in the United States. This resettlement comes after President Trump claimed that members of the Afrikaner minority were victims of "racial discrimination," a claim disputed by South Africa's Foreign Minister. The BBC reports that the UNHCR was not involved in the process, and Democrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen described the resettlement as "baffling" given the "indefinite suspension for thousands of legitimate asylum seekers" from other countries. The move has strained relations between the US and South Africa, with accusations of "race-baiting" and criticism of South Africa's stance against Israel at the ICJ.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC examines the challenges facing the UK government's immigration plan, noting that despite numerous promises and targets over the past 15 years, migration levels remain high. The government aims to reduce net migration to around 315,000 by the end of Parliament, but this is still higher than most years in the past decade. A key issue is filling labor market gaps, particularly in social care, where there are significant vacancies and concerns about low pay. The government also faces challenges related to overseas students, who are a major contributor to net migration but also a significant source of funding for UK universities.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department spent over $21 million on flights to Guantanamo Bay as part of the Trump administration's migrant deportation efforts. The Pentagon outlined that U.S. Transportation Command conducted 46 flights on military aircraft to Guantanamo Bay between January 20 and April 8. These flights were "in support of migrant deportation flights" and cost an average of $26,277 per flight hour. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the spending as a waste of military resources for political stunts. The Trump administration has transferred both "high-threat" and "low-risk" detainees to Guantanamo, with broad rules allowing non-criminal detainees to be held there.</p>

Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli Army, was captured from a military post during the Hamas-led attack on Israel.

          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its plans to reduce immigration into the UK, focusing on making the system "controlled, selective and fair." Key measures include tightening work visa requirements, increasing the residency wait time for indefinite leave to remain, and scrapping the dedicated care visa. The government aims to attract high-skilled individuals while addressing concerns about reliance on cheap overseas labor. The plans also include stricter rules for overseas students and an extension of the refugee pilot program. While the government wants to reduce net migration, it is not setting an overall cap.</p>

The man became unresponsive after six hours on the trail in Gold Canyon, near the Superstition Mountains. Emergency crews rescued the other hikers in the group, who were also suffering from heat-related problems and had run out of water. Officials are warning of the increased risks associated with climbing temperatures and urging hikers to take precautions, as heat illness can set in rapidly, even for experienced hikers.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have taken steps to de-escalate their trade war, agreeing to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods. This move acknowledges the economic costs of the trade war and aims to foster further negotiations. The agreement involves suspending tariffs for 90 days and continuing discussions led by senior officials. While the agreement is a positive development, it does not address key issues such as China's currency practices or trade imbalances. Global stock markets have responded positively to the news, reflecting optimism about the potential for a more comprehensive trade deal.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to curb immigration are raising concerns that skills shortages could worsen in sectors heavily reliant on immigrant labor. Trade bodies and businesses argue that new restrictions must be accompanied by measures to help them recruit and train UK residents. The social care sector, which relies heavily on non-British workers, voiced the greatest concern, warning of potential disruptions to care services. Other sectors, including hospitality, health, construction, and universities, also expressed concerns about the potential impact of the immigration crackdown on their workforce and operations.</p>

Traditionally, the Wallabies have prioritized players based in domestic teams or committed to returning to play in the country.
