The event, hosted by Anna Wintour alongside co-chairs Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky, and LeBron James, promises to showcase the significant role of Black style in fashion history.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is prioritizing the appointment of judges who align with his administration's stance on immigration, particularly regarding deportation processes. He emphasized the need for judges who would not require trials for every illegal immigrant, citing the impracticality of conducting millions of trials. Trump views his overhaul of U.S. immigration policies as a key campaign promise, expressing frustration with judges he perceives as delaying these efforts. He claimed that some judges are 'radicalized' and that the Supreme Court will not stand for lengthy trials for criminals who have entered the country illegally, as he believes it would threaten the nation's stability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, arguing that the American film industry is rapidly declining due to foreign incentives. He described this as a 'National Security threat,' emphasizing the messaging and propaganda aspects of film. Trump has appointed Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone as special ambassadors to promote Hollywood's business interests, aiming to revitalize the industry. Despite a decrease in production spending in the US, the country remains a major film production hub, though countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK have seen increased spending.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers fell to the Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley off poorly executed sweepers, overshadowing his otherwise effective performance. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Bryce Elder, failing to provide May with sufficient run support, despite a late home run from Miguel Rojas. May has yielded 14 runs in his last three outings, highlighting the importance of consistently landing his sweeper for his success as a pitcher.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NBC News, President Trump expressed uncertainty regarding whether everyone in the U.S. is entitled to due process and whether he has to uphold the Constitution as president. These comments arose during a discussion about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported El Salvadoran native, whose return to the U.S. has been delayed. Trump stated that his lawyers and the Attorney General have interpreted the Supreme Court's order to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's return differently. He also referenced allegations of Abrego Garcia's involvement with MS-13 and domestic violence allegations, despite Abrego Garcia's lack of a criminal record.</p>

          <p>Monday's UK newspapers are dominated by stories about counter-terrorism raids across England, resulting in multiple arrests and renewed calls for the government to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. The EU's refusal to grant Britain access to its crime and illegal migration databases as part of Brexit also features prominently. Political news focuses on reactions to Reform UK's success in local elections, with calls for the government to address immigration concerns and reverse cuts to the winter fuel allowance. Other stories include VE Day commemorations and President Trump's proposed budget cuts for NASA.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his offer to send U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, attributing her decision to fear of the cartels. Trump asserted that Sheinbaum is 'so afraid of the cartels she canâ€™t walk,' while highlighting the need to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Sheinbaum had confirmed that Trump pressed her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico but she rejected the offer, asserting Mexico's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The Trump factor is significantly influencing global politics, particularly in recent elections where right-wing parties aligned with MAGA principles have faced setbacks in Canada and Australia. In both countries, center-left incumbents surged ahead of conservative oppositions, who struggled to distance themselves from Trump's policies. Voters appear to be considering Trump's impact on their own countries when making decisions. This trend suggests that anti-Trump sentiment may be contributing to political outcomes worldwide, though the effect is not uniform, as seen in Germany.</p>

          <p>The year 2024 was the deadliest for Russian forces in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war, with at least 45,287 soldiers killed. The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with Mediazona, analyzed open-source data to identify over 106,000 Russian soldiers killed, estimating that the actual number could be between 164,223 and 237,211. Throughout 2024, Russian losses increased steadily, with an average of 27 lives lost for every kilometer of Ukrainian territory captured. Russia has managed to replenish its forces through increased recruitment and financial incentives, including volunteers who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>

          <p>ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith criticized the Democratic Party, stating that it needs to be 'purged' for him to consider associating with it. Smith expressed dissatisfaction with the party's leaning towards open borders, high spending, and the use of identity politics and cancel culture, arguing that these issues are not representative of what most Americans are thinking about. He also said that he is 'keeping the door open' for a potential run for president in 2028. He added that politicians of both parties are more focused on opposing each other than on the issues impacting Americans.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist who has promised to 'Make Romania Great Again,' won the first round of Romania's presidential election, bucking a recent trend of voters punishing candidates seen as friendly to President Trump.

Simion shares views including hostility to the European Union and opposition to military aid for Ukraine, with a previous ultranationalist candidate Calin Georgescu. The results prompted street protests and complaints that Europe was in 'retreat' from democracy and free speech.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on all movies 'produced in Foreign Lands,' claiming the US film industry was dying due to foreign incentives. He authorized the commerce department and the US trade representative to institute the tariff, citing it as a national security threat. The move comes after Trump triggered a trade war with China, which responded by reducing the quota of American movies allowed into that country. Experts warn that retaliation against Trump's tariffs would devastate the US film industry.</p>

          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular among women seeking to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution. The procedure is costly, with no guarantees of success, and presents risks to women who become pregnant at older ages. There are concerns about the emphasis on profits in the fertility industry, with critics accusing companies of prioritizing revenue over patient well-being. While egg freezing can be a good option for some, experts advocate for policies that support women in having children at younger ages.</p>
