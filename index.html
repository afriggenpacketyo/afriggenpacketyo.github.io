          <p>A tour bus carrying 63 passengers collided with a disabled SUV on State Route 60 near Hacienda Heights, California, resulting in one fatality and 32 injuries. The SUV caught fire, trapping and killing the driver, while the bus veered into a guardrail after the initial impact. Two bus passengers are in critical condition, and the remaining injured sustained minor to moderate injuries. The tour bus was en route to Koreatown from Morongo Valley, and authorities are investigating the cause of the SUV's disablement, but neither alcohol nor drugs appear to be factors in the crash.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent emotional plea for reconciliation with his family, particularly his cancer-stricken father King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter divisions within the British royal family. This comes as King Charles marks the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and prepares for a trip to Canada, yet his reign remains overshadowed by family drama. Harry's comments, made after a legal defeat over his security arrangements in Britain, have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties and moved to California. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles heals this rift, it could negatively define his reign.</p>

          <p>California, despite becoming the world's fourth-largest economy, faces significant challenges including population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a growing homelessness crisis. The state's vulnerability is exacerbated by an antagonistic relationship with the Trump administration, hindering federal assistance after devastating fires. While some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, others express concerns about rising costs, struggling public schools, and the future direction of the Democratic Party. The state's political leadership finds itself at a crossroads, with a new governor set to take office amid these pressing issues.</p>

          <p>Democrats are seeking to capitalize on parents' anxieties regarding rising prices of baby gear due to President Trump's tariffs and the spread of vaccine misinformation promoted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Trump administration's policies are transforming everyday parenting concerns into sources of anxiety and anger, presenting an opportunity for Democrats to connect with voters. Concerns over measles outbreaks and cuts to safe-to-sleep campaigns are particularly motivating parents, though Republicans have been more successful at tapping into parental emotions in recent years. The Democratic response has been scattershot, but some see an opening for candidates who can effectively channel parents' fears.</p>

          <p>A fire in a four-story apartment building in Milwaukee resulted in the deaths of four people and critical injuries to four others, with approximately 30 residents rescued. The fire, which began in a common area of the building, quickly escalated to a five-alarm level, requiring extensive response from multiple agencies. Firefighters rescued residents from upper floors using ladders and by navigating through heavy smoke conditions. The building, constructed in 1968, lacked a sprinkler system or standpipes, and the blaze has rendered it uninhabitable, displacing a couple hundred people.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program, part of his 2026 budget, is raising concerns among parents of students with disabilities. The plan aims to limit federal oversight and provide states with greater flexibility in using Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding, which could lead to reduced enforcement of minimum standards. The author argues that this shift could result in uneven educational opportunities and reduced accountability for states in meeting IDEA requirements. She highlights the potential erosion of a free and appropriate public education for students with disabilities, drawing on personal experiences and examples of disparities in special education.</p>

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham discussed the potential impact of Republican Medicaid cuts on her state, which has the highest Medicaid enrollment per capita. She argued that such cuts would harm access to healthcare, close hospitals, and negatively affect the economy. She also addressed the Trump administration's creation of a national defense area along the New Mexico-Mexico border, expressing concerns about due process and potential constitutional violations. The governor advocated for comprehensive border policy, increased Border Patrol agents, and efforts to prevent people from being denied access to visas and asylum status.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo defended owner Evangelos Marinakis' post-match intervention following a draw against Leicester, attributing it to confusion over the substitution of striker Taiwo Awoniyi.

Nuno praised Marinakis' passion and desire to improve the club, stating that his actions were driven by a desire to see the team succeed.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated his readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday for talks to end the war, shortly after Donald Trump urged Ukraine to accept Putin's offer of direct talks. Zelensky emphasized that a ceasefire must be in place before negotiations can begin, while Trump suggested this meeting would clarify the possibility of a deal. Western powers had previously called for a 30-day pause in fighting, and Putin's offer of direct talks followed this intervention. Zelensky expressed hope that Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks.</p>
