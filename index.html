          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman voiced concerns about President Trump's tariff policies, suggesting they could lead to an "economic nuclear winter." Ackman criticized the tariffs as disproportionate and warned they could erode confidence in the U.S. as a reliable trading partner. He highlighted the potential negative consequences for low-income consumers already facing economic challenges, while also criticizing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for a conflict of interest due to his firm's leveraged position in fixed income. The article also mentions that the Trump administration remains steadfast in its reciprocal tariffs against key trading partners despite global stock market volatility.

          <p>A BBC investigation revealed a significant increase in reported serious childcare incidents in English nurseries over the past five years. The incidents include serious injuries, harm, and even deaths. Ofsted suggests the rise may be due to increased reporting efforts, but experts argue it highlights a dire situation of low care standards, with short-staffing being a major contributing factor. Parents are calling for more frequent inspections and the use of CCTV to ensure child safety, following tragic cases of harm and neglect.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's announcement of tariffs, raising fears of a global trade war.

          <p>Despite heightened trade tensions with the U.S., China's central bank is signaling its intent to stabilize the yuan rather than devalue it sharply to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. The People’s Bank of China set the yuan's daily fixing at a four-month low, but it remains above the critical 7.2 benchmark. This move indicates a desire to maintain confidence in the currency and avoid further escalating trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering its response to the global economic disruption caused by President Trump's tariffs. Prime Minister Starmer faces a dilemma between retaliating against the U.S., which could prove popular domestically but harm relations with the U.S., or taking a measured approach to protect British businesses. Retaliation could involve tariffs on U.S. goods, potentially increasing costs for UK consumers, while appeasement could offer limited economic benefits but risk isolating the UK from other G7 nations.</p>

          <p>Many workers desire flexible work arrangements, but only a small percentage of job advertisements explicitly offer them. It is important to determine if an employer is open to flexibility without directly asking, which could lead to discrimination. Experts suggest inquiring about the company's culture, the working environment, and how performance is measured. Asking about a typical workday can reveal whether employees have set hours or can adjust their schedules to suit their needs.</p>

Unlike in countries such as China or Turkey, academics are (so far) not imprisoned, while most universities or their leaderships have not been taken over by the state, as they have been in countries such as Hungary and Turkey. Financial support to universities is being targeted and freedom of speech is being attacked. There are several ways to support US-based academics: academics can support by offering to host targeted data and research on open websites in Europe; journalists can be more sensitive to the situation of US-based academics when they approach them for interviews; universities can ensure that academics can continue their thriving career at your institution, etc.</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports despite the resulting shockwaves through global stock markets. Trump says "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," indicating he believes the tariffs are necessary to revitalize the U.S. economy. Top officials are downplaying recession fears, but stock markets in Asia have plunged, and economists are warning of potential negative consequences. Other countries are scrambling to respond to the tariffs, with some announcing retaliatory measures.</p>

Beijing has already committed to raising expenditures and may introduce policies to support consumption, the stock market, and sectors affected by the tariffs. (not investment advice) <br/><i></p>

          <p>The venture capital industry is experiencing significant turnover at the senior level, with many top-level executives leaving legacy firms. Reasons for these departures include slow decision-making at large firms, a focus on managing larger pools of money rather than working with founders, and a desire for more control over investment decisions. Some investors are capitalizing on changes in the industry by starting their own funds, while others are being pushed out due to the industry's downturn. (not investment advice) <br/><i></p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government's deportation of a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador was "wholly lawless" and ordered his return to the United States. The judge found little evidence to support allegations that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member and noted that an immigration judge had previously barred his deportation to El Salvador. The Justice Department has suspended an attorney who conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed.</p>
