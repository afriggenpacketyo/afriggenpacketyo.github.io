          <p>One man died and seven others, including emergency responders, received treatment for suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a takeaway in Bloxwich, West Midlands. Emergency crews responded to Cresswell Crescent on Friday night after concerns for a man's welfare. A man in his 50s was confirmed dead at the scene. Local councillor Michael Coulson suggested a generator operating without sufficient ventilation during refurbishment of Timmy's Pizza was the cause, leading to temporary evacuations of nearby properties.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared his intention to deploy federal troops to Portland, Oregon, to counter what he termed 'domestic terrorists' and protect ICE facilities. This announcement, made on Truth Social, authorized the use of 'full force if necessary.' Oregon's Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson strongly opposed the move, stating there was no national security threat and calling for zero federal troops. This action expands Trump's recent deployments to other cities, following the assassination of a conservative activist, intensifying concerns about authoritarian control.</p>

          <p>Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar used his UN General Assembly speech to criticize developed nations for 'tariff volatility, technology controls, and supply-chain coercion.' He urged the Global South to resist protectionism and advocated for 'de-risking' supply chains, particularly in critical minerals, in an implicit reference to China. Jaishankar emphasized the need for understanding and respect among nations, free from political interference and economic pressures, to ensure equitable global trade practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean, an event that has fascinated the public for decades. While widely believed she ran out of fuel and crashed, alternative theories persist, including one suggesting she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing accounts of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. Experts, however, generally dismiss the spy theories, attributing her disappearance to fuel exhaustion.</p>

While some criticized the kneeling as political, proponents argued it was a tactic to de-escalate tensions with protesters.

          <p>This article analyzes how Donald Trump's 'brazen' and public approach to alleged misconduct may be desensitizing the American public to scandals that would typically end political careers. Observers suggest that by openly discussing actions past presidents would conceal, Trump paradoxically gains a perverse credit for authenticity, diminishing the impact of accusations. Examples include directing the Justice Department to target political opponents and boasting about avoiding taxes. This strategy, coupled with a rapid news cycle and a loyal base, has arguably 'neutered' traditional checks on power, transforming public perception of political malfeasance.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from fermented fruit, equivalent to about one small bottle of beer daily for humans. Researchers observed chimpanzees ingesting fruit pulp with an average alcohol content of 0.3% in Uganda and Ivory Coast. This finding suggests that regular alcohol consumption may have deeper evolutionary roots in primates, challenging the notion that it is solely a human cultural phenomenon. Further research is needed to determine if the alcohol causes intoxication or is consumed deliberately.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports, effective October 1, 2025, unless companies build manufacturing plants in the US. This policy, shared via social media, exempts generic drugs and firms that have begun US construction. While some analysts believe the exemption for US production softens the impact, concerns remain about increased costs for American patients and disrupted global supply chains. Countries like Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland, major pharma exporters to the US, could be significantly affected, despite previous EU-US trade agreements capping tariffs at 15%.

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of Houston Texans co-founders, is suing the NFL for 'tortious interference,' alleging a conspiracy with current CEO Cal McNair. The lawsuit claims the NFL intervened in the McNair family business to remove McNair Jr. from his CEO position, aiming to silence him after he questioned player scandals. This alleged interference facilitated a restructuring of the family trust, excluding him from NFL-related influence. McNair Jr. seeks over $60 million in damages, arguing the NFL wrongfully interfered with his contractual and business relationships.</p>

Critics and former players question his 3-4-2-1 system and the team's consistency.
