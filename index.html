          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 00:05:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs have officially come into effect, marking a significant escalation in his administration's trade war policies. These "reciprocal tariffs" are aimed at reshaping the global trading system, which Trump views as unfair to the U.S. Notably, India faces a steep 50% tariff, partly due to its oil purchases from Russia, while major chipmakers investing in the U.S. may be exempt from new 100% chip tariffs. Countries worldwide, including the EU and Canada, have been racing to strike deals to mitigate the economic impact, as these levies risk substantially diminishing the allure of exports to the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's export growth in July significantly surpassed market expectations, climbing 7.2% in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, while imports recorded their biggest jump in a year, rising 4.1%. This data indicates a strong recovery in import levels and robust export support for the Chinese economy so far this year. Despite this positive trade performance, the country's factory activity unexpectedly deteriorated in July, and a critical tariff truce with the U.S. is set to expire soon, introducing potential future uncertainties for its trade balance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, a high-performance variant, has been identified as America's most-stolen vehicle, exhibiting a theft rate 39 times higher than the average for recent model years. According to the Highway Loss Data Institute, thieves frequently target expensive, powerful cars, often pickup trucks, due to their horsepower and exploitable on-board data ports. Conversely, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, partly because they are "connected" and often garaged, reducing their vulnerability. General Motors has since released a software update for Camaro models to enhance their security.</p>

          <p>An "unprecedented" wildfire is fiercely raging in southwestern France's Corbieres hills, near the Spanish border, having swept through 16,000 hectares. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by numerous aircraft, are battling the immense blaze, which has tragically caused one death, left one person missing, and injured 13 others, including nine firefighters. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described this as the largest fire in nearly 80 years, directly linking its catastrophic scale to global warming and severe drought conditions. Evacuations of several villages and campsites have been necessary, with widespread destruction reported.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old active-duty U.S. Army member, Taylor Adam Lee, has been arrested and charged under the Espionage Act for allegedly attempting to transmit classified M1A2 Abrams tank information to Russia. Lee, who held a top secret security clearance, reportedly sought Russian citizenship in exchange for the sensitive data and hardware, messaging "Mission accomplished" after delivering material to a storage unit. This alarming arrest serves as a stark reminder of the serious and ongoing threat posed by online espionage targeting U.S. service members, a trend counterintelligence officials are actively combating.</p>

Apple, for instance, has committed to an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing investments. This approach marks a departure from previous incentive-based strategies like the CHIPS Act, instead favoring a protectionist stance to force companies to establish factories domestically, despite potential impacts on corporate profits and consumer prices.

The government argues this overhaul, which redistributes approximately £2.1 billion annually, is necessary because councils' funding has become out of step with local demand for services.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total duty to 50%, effective in 21 days.

India's foreign ministry has labeled the tariff "unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable," noting that its increased Russian oil imports occurred because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe.

          <p>The UK government plans a significant crackdown on unsafe cosmetic practices by proposing new regulations that require licenses for clinics offering fillers and Botox. Additionally, risky non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to only qualified health professionals. These proposals aim to protect consumers from exploitation and severe harm, with age restrictions also planned for certain beauty procedures. The industry has largely welcomed the initiative, which follows years of concern over unregulated practices and incidents of serious complications, including a reported death. Implementation will require public consultation and parliamentary approval.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook stated that last week's significant downward revisions to May and June job numbers are "typical of turning points" in the U.S. economy, calling the July jobs report "concerning." The report showed weaker-than-expected growth and 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Cook highlighted an "uncertainty tax" weighing on businesses across industries, as executives dedicate more time to preparing for macroeconomic shifts and potential tariff-driven cost increases. This focus on uncertainty, she noted, could lead to lower GDP activity later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has attempted to justify firing Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by falsely claiming the agency's employment reports were "rigged" to politically harm him. Trump alleged that "phony" strong numbers released before the 2024 election were sharply revised downward after his victory. Experts, however, refute these claims, explaining that such revisions are a standard and necessary part of data collection as more information becomes available. The actual timeline of BLS revisions, including a large downward adjustment in August 2024, contradicts Trump's narrative and his allegations of manipulation. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. Department of Justice has filed legal findings that could potentially lead to the death penalty in this case. Rodriguez had reportedly expressed support for violence against Israelis in social media posts, indicating a clear motive for the attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's increased 50% tariffs on Indian goods, spurred by India's Russian oil trade, pose a significant multi-billion dollar threat to India's economy. While only about 20% of India's total goods exports, or 2% of its GDP, are U.S.-bound, specific sectors like gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles are disproportionately exposed to these levies. Experts suggest the 21-day delay before the new tariffs take effect offers a potential "off-ramp" for diplomatic negotiations. Despite this, the tariffs are expected to make Indian goods far costlier in the U.S., potentially cutting U.S.-bound exports by 40-50% in affected sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
