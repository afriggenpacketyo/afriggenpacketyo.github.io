          <p>A Senate committee report reveals the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The requests included enhanced counter-drone systems and additional personnel. The report accuses former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress and highlights significant communication failures within the agency on the day of the rally. It concludes these failures contributed to a preventable tragedy and calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has announced the "liquidation" of two agents allegedly working for Russia's FSB. The operation followed the fatal shooting of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Col Ivan Voronych, in Kyiv. The SBU stated the agents, who were foreign citizens, had tracked the colonel and were killed after resisting arrest. This event is part of a series of targeted killings and sabotage attacks conducted by both sides since Russia's full-scale invasion. Moscow has not yet commented on the Ukrainian claims.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" in response to Donald Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports. Macron stated the EU should be prepared for a potential trade war and urged the European Commission to accelerate the preparation of credible countermeasures if an agreement is not reached by August 1. His firm stance contrasts with calls for calm from other European leaders in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, highlighting potential divisions within the bloc on how to handle the escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced that its new "National No 1 Uranium" demonstration project has produced its first barrel of uranium. Located in Inner Mongolia's Ordos basin, this project utilizes an innovative mining approach described as "green, safe, intelligent and efficient," which reportedly avoids tunnels and toxic waste. This development in sandstone-type uranium deposit extraction marks a significant step for China's nuclear energy sector. The new method is intended to boost the country's competitiveness and support its growing demand for nuclear fuel with a more environmentally friendly process.</p>

He warns that the current decentralized organizing structure, with 11 different entities in the U.S. alone, puts host cities at financial risk with limited revenue opportunities compared to the 1994 model. He advises Andrew Giuliani, head of the new White House task force, to prioritize providing financial support to these cities to offset their significant costs. He also reflects on the differences in organizing such a global event.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd sparked global protests, this commentary argues that the systemic changes demanded by activists have not materialized. The authors contend that symbolic gestures and DEI initiatives were substituted for the fundamental transformation of the economy and policing that was sought. Instead, they point to increased police budgets, the suppression of dissent, and a new era of authoritarianism accelerated by the Trump administration. The article asserts that true safety is built by communities through mutual aid, not by a punitive system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has torn up a landmark 2023 civil rights settlement that mandated Alabama to address a decades-old raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, a poor, majority-Black region. The administration dismissed the agreement as an illegal "diversity, equity, and inclusion" (DEI) program. This decision halts a federally-backed initiative to provide functioning sanitation systems to residents, many of whom live with raw sewage seeping into their yards, posing significant health risks like hookworm. The move is part of a broader administration effort to dismantle programs aimed at tackling systemic inequality.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Texas's political culture explores why the nation's most disaster-prone state consistently fails to invest in adequate preparation for events like the recent deadly floods. Despite recurring catastrophes such as Hurricane Ike, Winter Storm Uri, and now the Hill Country floods, state leadership has repeatedly resisted proactive measures, such as building coastal barriers or strengthening the power grid. The article attributes this to a political ideology favoring small government and individualism, heavily influenced by the fossil fuel industry and a skepticism of climate change science, creating a cycle of disaster and insufficient response.</p>

Another focus is on Texas, where a potentially contentious Republican primary could make the state competitive for Democrats. The article also examines GOP recruitment challenges in Georgia and Michigan, the limited number of clear pickup opportunities for Democrats, and how both parties plan to weaponize the GOP's recent domestic policy bill.

However, the article argues that while the show may decenter whiteness in its casting, it still fails to engage with reality. It points to the unceremonious removal of two contestants for past use of racial slurs, which was explained away on-air as departures for "personal" reasons. This suggests producers are willing to promote a veneer of diversity while avoiding any direct confrontation with the complexities of race.</p>

          <p>The impact of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies is being felt directly by U.S. consumers, as illustrated by one man's experience. After purchasing a side table from Mexico for about $1,980, he was required to pay an additional $1,170 in customs fees to the delivery company before the item would be released. This explicit pass-through of costs highlights how tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, are often paid by consumers through higher prices or direct fees. Experts note that the high rates under the current trade policy make them too significant for businesses to absorb. (not investment advice)</p>
