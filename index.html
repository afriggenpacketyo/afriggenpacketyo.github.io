          <p>The Chinese military claims to have prevented a Philippine Navy ship from entering waters near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, an action the Philippines has condemned as reckless. According to the Chinese, naval and air forces were deployed to monitor, warn, and expel the ship, accusing the Philippines of distorting facts. The Philippines responded by accusing China of harassment and dangerous maneuvers, stating the incident occurred just 11.8 nautical miles southeast of the shoal, further escalating tensions in the disputed region. The South China Sea is a point of contention between many nations in the region, with China making sweeping claims over most of its waters.</p>

          <p>Several of Russia's allies in Eastern Europe, particularly Slovakia and Hungary, have voiced strong opposition to the European Commission's plan to phase out all Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by the end of 2027. These nations argue that such a move would amount to economic suicide and threaten the region's energy security and economy. They have traditionally relied on cheaper energy supplies from Russia and warn of higher energy prices for consumers if these supplies are banned. The EU aims to ensure full energy independence from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have accused India of launching a drone attack, calling it a serious provocation amidst ongoing clashes in the disputed Kashmir region. According to Pakistani officials, at least 13 drones were launched by India, with 12 being shot down, however one drone managed to engage a military target near Lahore, resulting in civilian and military casualties. India has not yet responded to the claims, which follow recent missile strikes by India inside Pakistan. The U.S. State Department has issued an alert for personnel at the consulate in Lahore, advising them to shelter in place due to the escalating situation. The current crisis was sparked by a massacre of tourists last month in Indian-administered Kashmir, which India quickly blamed on Pakistan.</p>

          <p>New York police arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University after they occupied part of the main library, resulting in injuries to two university security officers. University officials condemned the actions as outrageous, while protesters accused the university of violent repression. Videos showed protesters vandalizing bookshelves, leading to a standoff with public safety officers. The university president requested NYPD assistance, marking the first time since April 2024 that police were called for an on-campus protest.

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown.

The National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation in Hayes, west London. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious. The outage disrupted more than 270,000 journeys.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, political scientists argue that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, characterized by the systematic abuse of power to tilt the playing field against the opposition. They propose a metric based on the cost of opposing the government, noting that citizens now face punitive measures for criticizing or opposing those in power. The authors cite examples such as the weaponization of government agencies, attacks against the media and universities, and threats against Republican politicians who oppose Trump. The authors suggest that the country's authoritarian slide is reversible, but action from everyday citizens is required.</p>

Researchers analyzed the ingredient lists of products used by 64 women and found that 53% contained formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The study highlights concerns about the disproportionate exposure of Black and Latina women to these chemicals, with some researchers suggesting a link to higher rates of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers in Black women. The European Union banned formaldehyde as a cosmetic ingredient in 2009, and at least 12 states in the US have proposed or enacted regulations.</p>

          <p>Teacher union leaders have stated that, for many teachers, the outpouring of gratitude during Teacher Appreciation Week does not make up for the financial hardships and pressures they face the rest of the year. Intense scrutiny of teaching methods, proposed cuts to federal funding for schools and education programs, and low salaries have left many teachers feeling demoralized. Union leaders are encouraging communities to provide teachers with support 365 days a year, not just during Teacher Appreciation Week.</p>

          <p>Economists are warning that President Trump's proposed budget cuts to scientific research could have dire consequences for the U.S. economy. The proposed budget includes significant reductions for agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Economists argue that these cuts would undermine America's economic growth, as fundamental science underpins private-sector productivity. Some believe the private sector could replace government funding, but others say that industry can never fully replace the government as a funder of basic research.</p>

          <p>California beaches have recently experienced an influx of glittering Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, which are small, bright blue creatures that float on the ocean's surface. These creatures are washing ashore due to a shift in wind direction during the spring transition, and while they are related to jellyfish, their stinging cells are mostly harmless to humans. Scientists suggest that rising ocean temperatures may be connected to the increased frequency of these mass strandings.</p>
