          <h2>BBC Documentary Explores Widespread Abuse Within UK's 'Jesus Army' Cult</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new BBC documentary series investigates the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK, revealing a history of systemic abuse. The article interviews the documentary's director, Ellena Wood, who spoke with over 80 survivors, uncovering widespread trauma from physical and sexual abuse, particularly of children, within the group's communal homes. The investigation highlights how the church's founder, Noel Stanton, and senior leadership allegedly covered up complaints of sexual assault for years. The piece reflects on the lasting psychological impact on former members and the challenges they face in moving on from the cult, which formally disbanded in 2019.</p>

          <p>A stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, resulted in eleven people being injured and hospitalized. Authorities have taken a suspect into custody, stating that the attack, which occurred near the store's checkout area, appears to have been random. The suspect was reportedly armed with a folding knife, and no motive has been released as the investigation continues. Michigan's governor and federal authorities have acknowledged the situation, with the FBI offering support to the local sheriff's office. The event has shocked the northern Michigan community as officials work to understand the violent act.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a landing gear incident during takeoff. Passengers used emergency slides to exit the Boeing 737 MAX 8 as smoke and fire emerged from a tire. All 173 passengers and six crew members were evacuated safely, with only one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, leading to dozens of flight delays. American Airlines confirmed the aircraft experienced a maintenance issue and has been taken out of service for inspection.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and announced plans for humanitarian corridors as international pressure mounts over a severe hunger crisis. The move comes amid reports of starvation-related deaths and criticism of Israeli restrictions on aid delivery. While Israel states it is facilitating aid, UN officials and aid groups argue that airdrops are insufficient and that land access must be fully opened to address the man-made famine. The article details the dire situation, including the deaths of malnourished children and recent Israeli strikes that killed dozens of Palestinians, complicating the humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, was met with protests across the country, with demonstrators voicing opposition to his presence and criticizing the UK government's engagement with him. While Trump played golf, hundreds gathered in Edinburgh and other cities, organized by a coalition of activist groups. The protests, though smaller than those during his first term, featured chants and signs denouncing him as a dictator and fascist. Despite the public opposition, Trump's visit also includes meetings with UK and EU leaders to discuss trade, and his company's other Scottish golf course is set to host a government-supported championship.</p>

          <p>A Guess advertisement in Vogue featuring a flawless, AI-generated model has ignited controversy over its implications for beauty standards and the modeling industry. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, argue that using AI models is a lazy and cheap tactic that undermines years of progress toward diversity and inclusivity. The company behind the AI model defends its creation as realistic, but acknowledges that more diverse AI images receive less engagement online. The article explores concerns about the potential negative mental health impacts of such unrealistic imagery and the lack of clear labeling requirements for AI-generated content.</p>

Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat considered legendary by some modern scholars. Despite its removal from the Chinese school curriculum in 2017 due to skepticism, scientists are now using modern technology and new clues to restore the ancient wonder. The project aims to validate the historical accounts and honor an early achievement in seismic detection, long before the advent of today's advanced technologies.</p>

A lab at the University of New Mexico found significant plastic accumulation in human brain tissue, with higher amounts in the brains of dementia patients. Studies are also linking these particles, which enter the body through food, water, and air, to increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

Psychologists explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge during tense moments, causing increased heart rates and a 'fight or flight' response. To cope, experts recommend getting adequate rest, having a clear match day plan, eating well, and avoiding alcohol. They also suggest physical movement to release energy and reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for healthy emotional expression.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with daytime high temperatures struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. In July, downtown San Francisco's average temperature was about one degree below normal, a pattern not seen since the late 1990s. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the cool, gray conditions are a stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California, though experts warn that hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

XRP, on the other hand, is carving a niche in regulated finance with features that appeal to institutional users, such as compliance tools for tokenized debt and payment instruments.

          <p>The UK government is planning to change licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, a move aimed at revitalizing struggling town centers. Under the proposed reforms, developers building near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new properties. The changes also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and make it easier to open bars in disused shops. While the government hopes these measures will promote vibrancy and support the hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the plan as hypocritical, blaming the government's tax policies for harming the sector.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have survived a nationwide recall effort, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political gridlock. The recall campaign targeted 24 opposition lawmakers accused of being 'pro-China' and undermining national security. Since winning a parliamentary majority in early 2024, opposition parties have stymied President William Lai's agenda, cutting budgets and blocking appointments. The failure of the recall vote, which was the first of its kind on a national scale, emboldens the opposition and presents a continuing challenge for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a 'fantasist' and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a major lineup including Glastonbury headliners and was billed as the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, but was built on a foundation of lies. Kenny lured in employees, suppliers, and even claimed backing from prominent investors and the Welsh government, none of whom had any knowledge of him. The festival collapsed when payments failed to materialize, leaving employees and suppliers out of pocket and revealing a trail of alleged forgeries and false promises.</p>

He was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and hate-crime charges in February. The brutal attack drew global attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim discrimination in the U.S., deeply affecting the large Palestinian community in the Chicago suburbs.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas performed a sudden dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision with another aircraft. The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when the pilots received an onboard traffic alert. The other aircraft was identified as a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet also flying in the same airspace. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the event. While the maneuver was aggressive enough for some passengers to be lifted from their seats, the flight continued to its destination and landed safely, with one flight attendant treated for minor injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's expansive use of tariff powers is facing a critical legal test in federal court, with multiple lawsuits challenging his authority to impose duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a case that could invalidate many of Trump's major trade actions, including his worldwide 'reciprocal' tariffs. A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. The outcome of these cases, which are likely headed to the Supreme Court, could dismantle the legal foundation of his administration's signature trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

During the visit, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects, signaling a renewed partnership. The engagement is seen as a strategic move by India to counteract China's growing influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four as he was reportedly 'a bit stiff and sore,' having also suffered from cramp while batting. Stokes, who has a history of injuries, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his condition. His availability is crucial for England's victory push, as his absence would significantly weaken their bowling attack against a resilient Indian batting lineup.</p>

When asked, Trump replied, 'It's something I haven't thought about.' CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig expressed bewilderment at the response, calling it the 'easiest question in human history' and stating the answer should be an unequivocal 'no.' The exchange comes as Trump faces increasing pressure regarding his past association with the late Jeffrey Epstein, with whom Maxwell was a close associate in sexually abusing underage girls.</p>
