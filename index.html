          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that demand for AI computing power has surged significantly, particularly over the last six months. He attributes this to the evolution of AI models from simple query tools to complex reasoning systems, which require exponential computing resources. Huang noted strong demand for the company's Blackwell platform, suggesting the world is at the beginning of a new industrial revolution driven by artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military used a motorized paraglider to drop two bombs on a crowd gathered for a Buddhist festival and protest, killing at least 24 people and wounding 47. The attack occurred in the Sagaing region, a key battleground in the ongoing civil war that began after the 2021 military coup. This incident is part of an increasingly brutal campaign of airstrikes by the junta, which has recently acquired new drone technology and is regaining territory from resistance forces.</p>

          <p>France's ongoing political crisis has taken a new turn as prominent allies of President Emmanuel Macron, including former prime ministers, have begun to publicly criticize his leadership. Gabriel Attal, once a protégé, stated he no longer understands the president's decisions, while another former PM, Edouard Philippe, called for an early presidential election. This erosion of support from within his own camp marks a significant shift, deepening the political deadlock and threatening Macron's ability to govern effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend known as "locking in," involving periods of intense focus on personal goals, is gaining popularity among Gen Z on platforms like TikTok. This movement is seen as a reaction to the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing the generation, including the rise of AI and an uncertain job market. While it reflects a desire for self-improvement and control, it also raises questions about whether this focus on productivity comes at the expense of social connection and leisure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Parliament has approved a measure that would prohibit plant-based food producers from using terms like "burger" and "sausage" for their products. Proponents argue this protects consumers from being misled and preserves culinary traditions, while opponents, including Green Party members and major supermarkets, call the move unnecessary and a hindrance to innovation. Critics suggest the decision is a result of lobbying from the meat industry rather than a genuine effort to address consumer confusion.</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have been deployed to an Army Reserve Training Center near Chicago, a move authorized by the Trump administration that has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois officials. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the action, stating military troops should not be used against American communities and vowing to resist the "power grab." Chicago's mayor described the deployment as an intentional effort by the federal government to "foment chaos" in the city.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Poses Significant Risks to Commercial Real Estate Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a far-reaching negative impact on the commercial real estate (CRE) sector. Beyond delaying crucial economic data releases needed by investors, the shutdown creates market uncertainty, which can tighten credit and stall dealmaking. Sectors like retail and hospitality will see immediate effects from reduced consumer spending, while federal property leases, construction permits, and financing through agencies like HUD will face significant delays.
