          <p>Senedd member Laura Anne Jones has defected from the Welsh Conservatives to the Reform UK party, becoming its first representative in the Welsh Parliament. The announcement, made by Reform leader Nigel Farage, was met with anger from her former party, which accused her of letting down voters. Jones stated she could no longer support Conservative policies, while critics pointed to her past controversies, including a police investigation into her expenses and a probe into bullying allegations. Her move highlights growing political fragmentation and the rising influence of Reform in Welsh politics.</p>

          <h2>CBS to Conclude 'The Late Show' in 2026 Amid Financial Pressures and Political Speculation</h2>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," with its final episode to air when Colbert's contract expires in May 2026. The network cited the decision as "purely financial" amid a challenging late-night television landscape. However, the move has sparked speculation that it is politically motivated, potentially to appease President Trump ahead of a major corporate merger involving parent company Paramount Global. The cancellation is being viewed by some, including Jon Stewart, as symbolic of the decline of late-night political comedy and a sign of corporate capitulation to political pressure.</p>

          <p>Lenders are increasingly offering promotional introductory rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to attract borrowers in the current high-interest climate. While these offers can provide short-term savings with low initial rates, experts urge homeowners to be cautious. It is crucial to understand when the promotional period ends and how significantly the rate will increase afterward, as the fully indexed rate can be much higher. Borrowers should also read the fine print for potential pitfalls like prepayment penalties or early termination fees, ensuring the long-term costs do not outweigh the initial benefits.

          <p>Prominent economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign in order to protect the central bank's operational independence. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, argued on social media that the Fed faces growing threats to its autonomy, which would likely intensify if Powell remains in his position. This stance breaks from the general Wall Street consensus, which favors Powell completing his term. El-Erian's comments come amid criticism of the Fed from figures like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has called for a review of the institution's operations. (not investment advice)</p>

While corn syrup undergoes more processing and has a slightly higher fructose content, which some experts find concerning for inflammation, both are considered added sugars with empty calories.

          <h2>UK Food Bills Projected to Rise by £275 Annually as Inflation Accelerates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average UK household is projected to see its annual food and drink expenses increase by £275 as grocery price inflation rises. According to market researcher Worldpanel, food prices jumped 5.2% over the last month compared to the previous year, the highest increase since early 2024. In response, shoppers are altering their habits by purchasing cheaper own-brand goods and preparing simpler meals to cut costs. The rising cost of food is a significant contributor to the UK's overall inflation rate, which recently hit a new high, placing further strain on household budgets.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has officially announced it will introduce a version of its classic soda sweetened with cane sugar in the U.S. this fall. This move comes after President Trump publicly supported the switch from high-fructose corn syrup, which has been the primary sweetener in U.S. Coke since the 1980s. The new product is designed to complement the existing portfolio and cater to consumer preferences for alternatives like "Mexican Coke," which already uses cane sugar. The decision is notable given that longstanding U.S. tariffs and agricultural subsidies have historically made corn syrup a cheaper option for beverage companies.</p>

This deal marks a significant achievement for the five-year-old company, which also recently raised $70 million in capital, increasing its valuation to $900 million. Imprint partners with smaller banks and leverages its own technology to offer a seamless digital experience, which it argues gives it an edge over larger institutions reliant on third-party systems. The new Rakuten card will operate on the American Express network. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent figures in the MAGA movement are navigating a difficult political landscape as they weigh whether to press for more information on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal or align with President Trump's dismissive stance on the issue. While some conservative personalities have moved on, commentators like Tucker Carlson have continued to criticize the administration's handling of the files, arguing it mirrors the dismissiveness of the establishment Trump campaigned against. This internal conflict highlights a rare and significant challenge to Trump's control over his political base, forcing his supporters to choose between their own inquiries and loyalty to their leader.</p>

The article suggests that while President Trump's foreign policy has put China on the defensive globally, it has also created opportunities for Beijing to improve ties with rivals like India. A recent high-level visit by India's external affairs minister to Beijing was seen as a positive step. However, the dam project, a long-standing point of contention, could undermine this progress by raising concerns in India over water security and environmental impact.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced that its second-quarter core profit fell by 32% to $3 billion, attributing a $1.1 billion loss in operating income directly to President Trump's tariffs. The automaker maintained its forecast that trade headwinds could reduce its annual profits by $4 billion to $5 billion, though it aims to mitigate some of that impact. Despite the tariff-related losses, GM's underlying business remained solid, with a 7% rise in U.S. sales and strong pricing for its trucks and SUVs.

          <p>Japan's nationalist Sanseito party, led by Sohei Kamiya, achieved a significant victory in the recent upper house election, securing 14 seats. Campaigning on a "Japanese First" platform reminiscent of Donald Trump's movement, the party tapped into public dissatisfaction with mainstream politics by blaming foreigners for national problems and promoting traditional values. The result marks a major setback for the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its majority in the chamber. Sanseito's rise reflects a growing far-right sentiment in Japan, raising concerns about increasing xenophobia and a potential shift in the country's political direction.</p>

With the U.S. threatening steep tariffs, the EU could pragmatically negotiate with China to gain leverage. The author suggests that for the EU to expect China to pressure Russia over Ukraine, it must reconsider its own alignment with U.S. tech restrictions against Beijing, especially as the U.S. itself relaxes some controls. By re-evaluating its stance, the EU could potentially secure a more favorable outcome in its dealings with both superpowers.</p>
