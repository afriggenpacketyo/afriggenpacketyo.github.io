          <p>A Republican senator has voiced significant resistance to President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill," suggesting it might face hurdles in the Senate. Senator Ron Johnson stated that the bill doesn't adequately cut debt and might even increase the deficit, urging for deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels. Johnson indicated he has enough support to stall the bill until the President addresses spending reduction and deficit concerns. Speaker Johnson defended the bill as a significant investment that will stimulate the economy by reducing taxes and regulations, dismissing concerns about rising debt as overstated (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is still grappling with its diminished standing, struggling to understand why communities once considered reliable now lean right. One researcher likened the party to a deer in headlights, paralyzed and vulnerable. The article notes that the party's approval ratings have sunk to historic lows and working-class voters have steadily drifted toward the Republican Party. A new series by The New York Times will examine the Democrats' predicament, exploring potential paths forward and leaders who could guide the way.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Nice, France, affecting around 45,000 households, after an electrical facility was damaged in a suspected arson attack. The incident occurred a day after a similar outage disrupted the Cannes Film Festival, leading authorities to suspect "malicious acts." Nice's mayor and public prosecutor have condemned the incident, launching a criminal investigation into organized arson. Police are investigating whether the Nice blackout is related to the Cannes outage, while also looking into a separate incident of electricity pylon damage near Cannes.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Premier League following a contentious refereeing decision during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. A goal by Morgan Rogers was disallowed due to referee Thomas Bramall's perceived foul, a decision Villa's director of football, Damian Vidagany, criticized given Bramall's inexperience. The club is questioning why more experienced international referees were not assigned to the game, which had Champions League implications. Villa manager Unai Emery expressed his frustration, acknowledging the mistake but emphasizing the need to accept the outcome.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order is drawing criticism for expanding presidential authority and potentially undermining the rule of law. The court's decision, concerning the removal of officials from the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, effectively allows President Trump to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. This move is seen as radical, overruling precedent without full briefing or argument, and assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law. The author suggests the decision emboldens the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order, potentially leading to unchecked presidential power.</p>

          <p>Ketamine therapy, once primarily used as an anesthetic, is gaining popularity as a treatment for depression, with reality stars touting its benefits, though it is also misused recreationally. The FDA has approved a ketamine derivative for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, with some studies showing effectiveness in treating severe depression in veterans. Experts caution that ketamine carries risks, including cardiovascular issues, addiction, and other adverse effects, emphasizing the importance of medical supervision. While ketamine IV therapy could be an alternative option if other treatments havenâ€™t been effective for mental health conditions, experts urge caution and that it is important for the IV treatment to be monitored by medical professionals in case dangerous side effects occur.</p>

The officer, Leslie O'Neal, pulled over Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation that was later dropped, but not before she was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). O'Neal's resignation letter cited a lack of support from the police department amid criticism over the arrest.

          <p>Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at NYU, asserts that Elon Musk's involvement with the White House DOGE Office has significantly damaged Tesla's brand. Galloway cites a recent poll showing Tesla's ranking plummeting from eighth to 95th place among America's most visible companies. He attributes this decline to Musk's shift towards politics, alienating Tesla's core customer base, and cozied up to people who aren't interested in EVs. Musk has stated he plans to reduce his government involvement to focus on Tesla and other companies.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. This investment contradicts Japan's role in promoting a fossil fuel phase-out through the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC). Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" in AZEC countries constitutes greenwashing, as LNG involves significant emissions. Experts suggest Japan should prioritize renewable energy investments in Southeast Asia to facilitate a genuine energy transition.</p>

          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs to foster resilience, trust, and connection. This approach focuses on open communication, self-awareness, and inner healing, setting clear boundaries with empathy rather than control. Emotionally safe parents view misbehavior as a signal for support, respond without shaming, and take responsibility for conflicts. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves doing inner work to understand personal triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through reconnection and validation.</p>
