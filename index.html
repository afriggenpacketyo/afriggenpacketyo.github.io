          <p>This article details the arrest of two suspects in Brazil who were allegedly planning a bomb attack on a Lady Gaga concert at Copacabana Beach. The suspects, reportedly fans of the singer, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives.

Despite the threat, the concert proceeded without incident, and Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the fact.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Bill Belichick's reported exploration of a PR move following criticism of his recent CBS interview. The North Carolina Tar Heels football coach has been in talks with at least one public relations expert with hopes of increasing interest in his book and the program in general for several months, sources told Pro Football Talk on Sunday. Belichick had been under the spotlight since the interview aired last weekend, which was supposed to be about his book and the people he mentioned or didn’t mention, including his 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson, who was described as Belichick’s "creative muse."</p>

          <p>This article reports that the Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" its operations in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was "increasing the pressure" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants. Critics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict. The move follows failed international negotiations to reach a new ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how President Trump's administration is seeking to expand executive power, drawing from right-wing thinkers like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss who favor monarchical or dictatorial rule. The article argues that these ideas, which challenge the constraints on presidential power established during the Progressive and New Deal eras, pose a threat to American democracy. It suggests that figures like Russell Vought are instrumental in connecting Trump to these intellectual precursors, leading to actions such as the firing of inspectors general and the disregard of judicial rulings. The piece concludes by emphasizing the importance of upholding constitutional limits to prevent the transformation of the presidency into a dictatorial office.</p>

          <p>This article reports on the box office success of Marvel and Disney's new release, "Thunderbolts*," which has garnered $162 million internationally. The film, featuring an ensemble cast of antiheroes, has received positive audience reviews, with a 95 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. Some critics have been less favorable, but have said Pugh can wrestle sincerity out of a screenplay (and a franchise) that has so little. The film's success is seen as a positive sign for Marvel, which has been trying to introduce new characters and storylines since "Avengers: Endgame."</p>

          <p>This article discusses a social media post by the White House featuring a meme of President Trump styled as a character from Star Wars.

The article notes the irony and confusion surrounding the image, especially following criticism of a previous AI-generated photo of Trump as the Pope. The image also features Trump clad in a Jedi robe and sporting oversized muscles, as well as a backdrop that includes two bald eagles and the American flag.</p>
