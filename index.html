            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 09:20:57 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK government has enacted a temporary ban on individuals bringing cheese and certain meats from the EU into Great Britain to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease, impacting travelers arriving by plane, train, bus, or car. This measure does not apply to Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man, and commercial importers are exempt due to stricter import standards. Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans but highly contagious among animals like cattle, sheep, and pigs, causing fever and blisters. The ban's duration remains indefinite, pending the government's assessment of the risk posed by travelers.</p>

            <p>Mitchells & Butlers, the owner of Toby Carvery, has issued an apology for cutting down a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, admitting the need to tighten protocols following the incident. Despite being recognized as a "fine specimen" in planning documents, the tree was felled after a team member acted on expert advice citing health and safety concerns. Enfield Council has reported the felling as criminal damage, and local residents have expressed outrage at the loss of the nationally significant pedunculate oak. The company plans a thorough review to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

            <p>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick inadvertently added hundreds of Westminster insiders to a WhatsApp group intended for promoting his London Marathon run, causing a data mishap. The incident was dismissed by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who was also briefly a member, and included senior journalists, former cabinet members, and Tory MPs. Jenrick's intention was to send individual messages to raise money for charity, but a technical error turned it into a group chat, which has since been deleted. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is not involved, as the use of contacts was for personal purposes.</p>

            <p>Turkey's central bank unexpectedly increased its key interest rate by 350 basis points, raising it from 42.5% to 46%, reversing its easing cycle that began in December of last year. This decision follows economic disruption caused by U.S. tariffs and political upheaval, including the arrest of Istanbul's mayor, leading to investor flight. The Monetary Policy Committee aims to strengthen the disinflation process through tight monetary policy, hoping to achieve price stability via a sustained decline in inflation, which was 38.1% in March. The hike also addresses significant foreign currency depletion following protests related to the mayor's arrest.</p>

            <p>A new study by Lead Safe Mama reveals that many popular toothpaste brands, including those for children and marketed as "green," are contaminated with lead and other heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and cadmium. Approximately 90% of the toothpastes tested contained lead, with some exceeding federal and state limits, raising concerns about potential health risks, especially for children. The contamination is believed to stem from ingredients like hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate, and bentonite clay, and while some companies claim the levels are trace and unavoidable, none have committed to removing lead from their products.</p>

            <p>Potential tariffs on Chinese imports under President Trump's trade policies could significantly increase the cost of everyday electronics, with items like toasters, hair curlers, and humidifiers being particularly vulnerable. Many consumer technology products rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, and the ecosystem supporting their assembly is difficult to replicate elsewhere. While some smartphone production is expanding beyond China, lower-priced goods might disappear from the U.S. market if factory owners deem it unprofitable to ship them. The secondary market for refurbished electronics could see increased demand, but the cost of parts and labor may also rise due to tariffs.</p>

Russia's reaction to the tariffs has been mixed, with some detachment and concern over global volatility, but also a degree of schadenfreude at the turbulence hitting the West.

The company's assets, including its genetic database, are up for sale after filing for bankruptcy, raising fears that sensitive personal information could be compromised due to the lack of a comprehensive federal data privacy law.</p>

            <p>Organ meats, once unpopular in the U.S., are experiencing a revival within online wellness communities promoting "ancestral" diets, driven by influencers touting their nutrient density. This trend has led to the creation of offal-based supplements and powders, often "sneaked" into smoothies and other foods. Major retailers like Whole Foods and Erewhon have capitalized on this trend, offering organ-meat blends and smoothies. While organ meats are nutrient-rich, experts caution against overconsumption and potential toxicity, particularly with vitamin A, and advise treating them as food rather than supplements.</p>

Roth IRAs offer tax-free gains and withdrawals in retirement, with contributions taxed upfront. Orman suggests that Roth IRAs are superior to traditional IRAs regardless of income bracket due to potential future tax rate increases. Converting involves moving funds from a pre-tax account to a Roth account, paying taxes on the converted amount, and then enjoying tax-free growth and withdrawals. (not investment advice)</p>
