          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite recent speculation following Union Pacific's bid for Norfolk Southern. However, he met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss enhancing efficiency through greater cooperation between BNSF Railway and CSX. This clarification led to a drop in CSX shares and other railroad stocks. Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF and CSX had already announced a partnership to provide new coast-to-coast rail services, aiming to achieve benefits similar to a merger without the acquisition premium.

Norrie was leading 7-5, 6-4 when Korda, who had recently returned from a shin stress fracture and appeared to be struggling with an abdominal issue, decided to end the match. Norrie expressed sympathy for Korda, acknowledging his talent and their past matches. Despite feeling nervous about the early start, Norrie secured his spot to face either Francisco Comesana or Alex Michelsen next in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Kennedy Center has named Stephen Nakagawa, a choreographer and former dancer, as its new director of dance programming, days after the entire dance department staff was fired. This appointment is unusual as Nakagawa's biography lacks experience in arts administration or curation. The firings have sparked controversy, with former director Jane Raleigh alleging her dismissal was retaliation for supporting a union organizing campaign. This leadership change occurs as the Kennedy Center seeks increased congressional funding, with Senate Republicans linking substantial funding boosts to renaming the opera house after Melania Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his feud with Maryland Governor Wes Moore, threatening to revoke federal funding for the Francis Scott Key Bridge reconstruction in Baltimore. This threat follows a war of words over Baltimore's crime rates, with Trump suggesting he might "rethink that decision" regarding the $1.9 billion federal aid. Governor Moore's office criticized the move, stating it would cause "irrevocable damage" to the national economy and Maryland, jeopardizing a vital infrastructure project. The Port of Baltimore is crucial for over 20,000 jobs and significant trade, handling essential goods like heavy machinery and metals.</p>

          <p>European postal carriers from several countries are pausing certain shipments to the U.S. as they adapt to the end of the "de minimis" exemption, a trade rule allowing duty-free imports under $800. President Trump's executive order, which ended the exemption for China in May and globally on Friday, has left many European systems unprepared for new customs requirements. DHL and national post offices in Spain, France, and Belgium cited unresolved questions regarding duty collection and data transmission. This temporary suspension is expected to primarily impact smaller orders from European businesses, potentially causing delays but not significantly affecting most international commerce.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting arrest.

Police reported that Hill allegedly charged at officers before being taken into custody. His bail has been set at $75,000, and this legal development follows his Grammy wins in 2020 for "Old Town Road."</p>

          <p>A CNN reporter recounted witnessing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest at a Maryland gas station, involving masked agents in an unmarked car and a rifle-wielding officer. The encounter, which felt like a "rendition," raised immediate concerns about the lack of official identification and the perceived unconstitutionality of the tactics. The reporter's subsequent search for the detained individual, identified as Samuel Antonio Garcia Apilcano, highlighted the difficulty of tracking those apprehended. ICE later confirmed the arrest, stating it was part of "intelligence-based, targeted enforcement operations," but the incident underscores growing concerns about immigrant rights and the transparency of federal enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by the prevalence of "ghost jobs"—job postings without a genuine intent to hire—a tech worker named Eric Thompson is spearheading a movement for federal legislation to ban the practice. His proposed "Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act" aims to require transparency in job listings, including intended hire dates and whether roles are new or backfills. The bill, targeting businesses with over 50 employees, would impose fines for violations. Thompson's advocacy, driven by his own job search experience, highlights a growing concern among job seekers and has garnered attention from lawmakers, with similar proposals emerging at state levels.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that great white sharks are spending more time in the cooler waters off New England and Canada's Atlantic coast, a trend linked to the increased availability of their seal prey. Sightings are now more common in areas like Maine, where they were once rare, indicating a shift in their distribution. While this means boaters and beachgoers are learning to coexist with the predators, shark experts emphasize that fatal shark bites remain exceedingly rare. Maine has recorded only two unprovoked shark attacks since 1837, with the most recent in 2020.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a widespread "blind box" craze, where consumers purchase mystery items without knowing the exact variant until unboxed.

Young consumers, seeking affordable splurges and the excitement of a gamble, are driving massive profits for retailers. However, the Chinese government has issued warnings against "irrational consumption" and "addiction," particularly among minors, calling for stricter regulations on the trend.</p>

However, this brief period of warmth is set to end as the remnants of Hurricane Erin approach, bringing wet and windy weather across most of the UK. This shift is welcomed in many areas that have experienced a particularly dry summer, leading to hosepipe bans and concerns for harvests, with scientists linking intense heatwaves to climate change.</p>

Scottish Water is considering temporary measures like moving water from the River Isla to reservoirs, which are less than half full in some areas.
