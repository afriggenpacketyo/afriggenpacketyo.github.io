          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump met with House Republican holdouts on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to salvage the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." The GOP is struggling to unify around the bill, facing sticking points over Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deduction caps. Johnson remains optimistic about passing the bill this week, but hard-liners are pledging to vote against it, citing concerns about the national deficit. The White House Office of Management and Budget released a letter urging passage, calling failure to do so "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

          <p>Israeli soldiers fired warning shots on Wednesday to disperse a group of senior Western diplomats, Palestinian officials, and journalists touring Jenin in the West Bank, intensifying friction between Israel and its foreign partners. The incident occurred amid rising tensions and growing international criticism of Israel's conduct in Gaza and the West Bank. According to the Israeli military, the troops fired shots because the delegation "deviated from the approved route." The French and Canadian foreign ministers have expressed their disapproval and summoned Israeli ambassadors for explanations, while the EU called for accountability.</p>

          <p>Health insurer Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached a new deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to cap copays on popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

Employee out-of-pocket costs will be capped at $200 per month, less than half the cash price without insurance.

His attorney argues Williams was performing his job duties and the inmates planned the escape.

          <p>Stocks closed significantly lower on Wednesday as bond yields surged amid deficit concerns related to a tax cut measure in the House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 817 points, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also declined. The sell-off coincided with a rise in bond yields, increasing the cost of U.S. borrowing and causing investor anxiety. The Congressional Budget Office found that Trump's tax policies would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt, contributing to the market's volatility.</p>

          <p>The proposed "big, beautiful" tax bill put forward by Republicans may lead to substantial cuts in federal food assistance programs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, could face a 30% reduction, which would be the "biggest cut in the program's history." The proposed cuts would largely happen by expanding work requirements to qualify for benefits and by cutting federal funding for food benefits, potentially affecting over 40 million individuals, including children, seniors, and adults with disabilities.</p>
