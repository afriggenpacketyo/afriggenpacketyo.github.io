          <p>AppLovin's stock experienced a significant jump after the company announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, coupled with the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash. This deal will also grant AppLovin a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot. While the first-quarter net income rose sharply to $576 million, the company anticipates lower sales for the second quarter, falling short of analyst predictions. Despite the projected sales dip, investors reacted positively to the earnings beat and strategic business shift.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new Surgeon General, replacing his initial choice, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Means, a wellness influencer and co-author of "Good Energy," advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction as a root cause of chronic diseases. She is expected to collaborate closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on wellness initiatives. This decision follows concerns raised about Dr. Nesheiwat's qualifications and ideological alignment with the president, marking a shift towards a nominee with strong ties to the Make America Healthy Again movement, or MAHA.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, currently ranging from 4.25% to 4.5%, as it assesses the potential economic impacts of President Trump's trade policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged rising economic risks, including concerns that tariffs could lead to both higher inflation and unemployment. The central bank is adopting a wait-and-see approach, maintaining flexibility to adjust rates in response to economic developments. Wall Street analysts interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk of stagflation, prompting the Fed to emphasize patience amid economic uncertainty.</p>

The system provides larger tax breaks for bigger incomes, while the majority of Americans receive no federal tax benefit for their donations. The author proposes replacing the charitable deduction with a system that offers the same federal subsidy for every donated dollar, regardless of the donor's income, to promote equity in philanthropy and reduce the incentive for charities to prioritize wealthy donors.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, maintaining a wait-and-see approach amid economic volatility caused by President Trump's trade policies. The Fed acknowledged a solid labor market but noted increased uncertainty and rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation. Chair Jerome Powell stated the Fed is prepared to respond to economic developments but remains unsure of the appropriate course of action, as investors fled financial “safe havens”. The Fed’s cautious stance reflects the complexities of managing monetary policy amid trade-related uncertainties.</p>
