          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 06:06:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government watchdog found that historical child grooming investigations were significantly delayed because Manchester City Council heavily redacted evidence documents. The report noted this made assessing evidence impossible, though a new information-sharing protocol has since been established to prevent future issues. While the police force has made significant improvements in its approach to such cases, the past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" among some victims and survivors. The article notes one victim reported she had been subjected to sexual assault.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's major domestic spending bill and his military strike on Iran demonstrate a continuation of, rather than a departure from, long-standing American political ideologies. The author defines the domestic bill, with its tax cuts for the wealthy and cuts to social programs, as a clear example of neoliberalism. Similarly, the airstrike is framed as a revival of neoconservative, militaristic foreign policy, suggesting Trump's presidency represents continuity with the past rather than a significant change.

          <p>An Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years was arrested by ICE agents from her yard in New Orleans, leaving her family seeking answers.

          <p>Fans of the singer Lorde are reporting that the CD version of her new album, "Virgin," is unplayable in some stereo systems. The disc is transparent, in keeping with the album's aesthetic themes, but this design may interfere with the lasers used by some CD players to read data. While some fans have been able to play the disc on devices like a PlayStation, many are frustrated that a physical product they purchased does not work as expected, prompting them to contact the record label for a solution.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece urges members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to vote in favor of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" to prevent a major tax increase scheduled for 2026. The author argues that while the bill is not perfect, blocking it would be reckless and would kill a unique opportunity to boost the economy, secure the border, and strengthen national defense. The column suggests holdouts should be offered control of a second, future reconciliation bill focused on entitlement reform as an incentive to pass the current legislation.

          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors has identified a pattern in many healthy individuals where blood sugar plummets a few hours after eating, a phenomenon termed a "dip." These dips can trigger hunger, fatigue, and mood changes, potentially leading to overeating and making weight management more difficult. To prevent these crashes, nutrition experts recommend "clothing" carbohydrates by pairing them with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, spreading carb intake throughout the day, and eating the protein and fiber portions of a meal first.</p>
