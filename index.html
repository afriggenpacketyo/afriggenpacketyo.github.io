          <p>Beijing has agreed to moderately relax export controls on some rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech and aerospace industries, as part of a trade truce with the United States. This move signals China's willingness to de-escalate tensions while maintaining control over these critical resources. The agreement involves pausing or removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed since April, along with lowering most tariffs for 90 days. Following China's initial restrictions, prices of some rare earth elements had surged in the overseas market, indicating the impact of China's policy.</p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, which, if successful, would be a significant tactical victory, though its long-term impact remains uncertain. Sinwar is considered a leading military commander and an obstacle to a new cease-fire. However, analysts suggest that his death may not fundamentally alter Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to negotiations. Despite the potential blow to Hamas, the group's survival has historically not depended on any single individual, and Israel's aims extend beyond eliminating specific commanders.</p>

          <p>Grigory Melkonyants, head of Russia's only independent election watchdog, Golos, was sentenced to five years in prison for working with an "undesirable organization." Melkonyants was jailed in 2023 after President Putin's invasion of Ukraine, charged with organizing activities of an undesirable organization. Golos, which documented widespread election fraud, was labeled a "foreign agent" in 2013. The charges relate to the group's past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite changing family dynamics, many people still assume that mothers are the default parent, even when fathers are actively involved. Research shows that schools and doctors' offices often contact mothers first, even when fathers are listed as the primary contact. This assumption can be frustrating for both parents, disrupting mothers' work and undermining fathers' roles. The persistence of this stereotype highlights societal biases and outdated systems that need to be addressed to support equitable parenting.</p>
