          <p>U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a pivotal speech as investors seek clarity on her plans to address a slowing economy and a government debt nearing 100% of GDP. Key areas of focus include a potential overhaul of the pensions system and speculation about tax increases for the financial sector to fill a growing fiscal gap. The government has ruled out raising taxes on working people and is committed to the 'triple lock' on pensions, limiting its options for raising revenue. This speech is a critical moment to reassure markets about the U.K.'s public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an exclusive BBC phone interview, former President Donald Trump expressed that he is 'disappointed but not done' with Russian President Vladimir Putin, while also stating he trusts almost no one. The conversation occurred after Trump announced plans to send weapons to Ukraine and threatened tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached. He also reversed his previous stance on NATO, now endorsing the alliance and its collective defense principle. Trump reflected on his relationship with Putin, noting his frustration with failed peace deal attempts and Russia's continued aggression in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government is introducing a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 to incentivize the purchase of new electric cars. The discounts will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are part of a £650 million, three-year plan to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban. While the move is welcomed by some automakers, critics argue the country lacks sufficient public charging infrastructure, with only 82,000 points currently available. The policy aims to make zero-emission vehicles more affordable for families, but faces opposition who claim the country is not ready for the shift.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must power the massive energy needs of data centers with its abundant natural gas reserves. The author argues that relying on renewable energy sources is not currently scalable or reliable enough to meet the surging demand, risking the loss of AI innovation to other countries. The piece advocates for a pragmatic energy policy that co-locates natural gas power generation with data centers, independent of the main grid, to ensure affordability and prevent strain on consumer electricity supplies. This strategy is presented as essential for America's economic growth and national security.</p>

          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will mandate that sex education classes include lessons on recognizing misogyny, understanding consent, and identifying the harms of AI-generated 'deepfakes'. The updated curriculum aims to help pupils identify positive male role models and resist harmful online influences, without imposing strict age limits on specific topics as previously proposed. Primary schools will cover respectful relationships and online risks, while secondary students will learn about sexual ethics and power dynamics. The move, welcomed by suicide prevention campaigners, is part of a broader effort to address the behavior and attitudes of boys and young men.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed a major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland, exposed after CCTV cameras were mistakenly left running for six months. The 300,000 hours of footage captured hundreds of incidents of physical and emotional abuse against vulnerable, disabled adult patients by staff members. Despite the discovery in 2017, which triggered the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation, no cases have yet gone to trial, and families have not been permitted to view the footage. The scale of the cruelty and neglect has been described by experts as dwarfing previous scandals, prompting criticism of the subsequent public inquiry's handling of the case.</p>

The ruling came after immigrant advocacy group CASA filed a lawsuit challenging the decision, arguing it is not safe for these individuals, many of whom assisted the U.S. during the war, to return to Afghanistan.

          <p>Russia is confronting a severe demographic crisis that could result in a labor shortage of nearly 11 million people by 2030, according to its labor minister. The problem is driven by plummeting birth rates and exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which has led to battlefield casualties and a 'brain drain' of educated professionals. President Putin has identified population growth as a national priority, but the country's birth rate fell to its lowest level since 1999 last year. This long-term economic threat is already causing businesses to struggle, fueling wage growth and inflation, and straining the wartime economy.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in electric vehicle adoption, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025, a dramatic increase from less than 1% in 2010. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong, consistent policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This approach, combined with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo. The absence of a domestic automaker lobby is also considered a key factor in the rapid and successful transition.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has won the 2025 All-Star Home Run Derby, defeating Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero 18-15 in the final round. Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, is the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to win the competition. He advanced from the first round on a narrow tiebreaker before winning his semifinal match. One of the night's highlights was a 513-foot drive by Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, the longest of the event. Raleigh becomes the second Mariners player to claim the Derby title, following Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Animals Can React to Sounds Made by Plants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 23:02:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds produced by a plant, suggesting a previously unknown ecosystem of communication may exist. Researchers at Tel Aviv University found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic 'screams' associated with distress, such as dehydration. These sounds, which are outside the range of human hearing, could be perceived by many insects and some mammals. The discovery opens up a vast, unexplored field of study into how animals and potentially other plants use these acoustic signals to make decisions about their environment.</p>

          <p>A joint report from the WHO and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide received no vaccinations in 2024, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. The report highlights a concerning trend in Europe, where childhood vaccination rates have stagnated or declined, leading to a tripling of whooping cough cases and a doubling of measles infections. Widespread misinformation and cuts to international aid are cited as major factors widening these coverage gaps. The findings underscore a global health challenge, with the U.S. also experiencing its worst year for measles in a quarter-century.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to incinerate nearly 500 metric tons of emergency high-energy biscuits, enough to feed 1.5 million children for a week, after the food aid expired in a Dubai warehouse. The rations, originally intended for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, were never distributed due to an executive order halting most foreign assistance, despite repeated requests from USAID staff to ship them. The destruction will cost taxpayers an additional $130,000 on top of the $800,000 purchase price. This incident highlights the dysfunction within U.S. foreign aid programs as global food insecurity reaches critical levels.</p>

          <p>A multinational crew of four private astronauts has departed the International Space Station (ISS) to begin their 22-hour journey back to Earth. The mission, organized by Axiom Space, was led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson and included crewmates from India, Poland, and Hungary. During their 18-day stay, the astronauts conducted dozens of microgravity experiments. This flight, Axiom's fourth, represents a growing commercialization of low-Earth orbit, providing opportunities for countries and private entities to participate in space research. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is expected to splash down off the coast of California.</p>

The department had issued a public appeal after the weapon, secured in a hard case, was believed to have fallen from a patrol car. A resident of Lennox found the case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to a local sheriff's station.

          <p>A group of prominent landowners, including the Grosvenor Group and charitable foundations, has initiated a High Court challenge against the UK government's recent leasehold reforms. They argue that provisions in the 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, violate their human rights to private property. The claimants contend the changes will cause them significant financial losses without adequate compensation. Leaseholder campaign groups fear the legal battle will stall much-needed reforms for years, leaving many homeowners trapped in unsellable properties with escalating ground rents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. will send significant new weaponry to Ukraine via NATO allies, who will fund the transaction, former President Donald Trump announced after meeting with the NATO chief. This marks a major policy shift, with Trump also issuing a 50-day ultimatum to Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe 100% secondary tariffs on its remaining trade partners. The move is intended to cripple Russia's war economy and pressure Moscow into negotiations. This development signals a tougher stance on Russia from the Trump administration, shifting from prior attempts at direct diplomacy to a strategy of military and economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries fails to provide a complete picture of its talent costs, as many of its highest-paid personalities are not included. Stars who are employed by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm BBC Studios, do not appear on the list. This means the earnings of popular figures like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the hosts of shows like 'The Traitors' and 'Strictly Come Dancing' remain undisclosed. The criteria, which only covers talent paid directly from the license fee above a certain threshold, omits a vast number of actors, presenters, and entertainers.</p>

Health experts express concern over the products' colorful packaging and appealing flavors, which can attract children.

          <p>The future of the animated series 'South Park' is in jeopardy due to a major contract dispute between its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and Paramount Global's incoming owner, Skydance. The disagreement centers on a proposed 10-year, $3 billion deal that Skydance is reportedly unwilling to approve, preferring a shorter five-year term amid a shifting media landscape. The conflict, which has already delayed the show's 27th season premiere, is escalating, with the creators bringing on an aggressive lawyer.

          <p>The deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino, is reportedly considering resigning after a heated confrontation with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the political fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a former rightwing podcaster and a controversial appointee, clashed with Bondi after a Department of Justice memo contradicted widespread beliefs within the MAGA movement about Epstein's death and a supposed client list. The public infighting among Trump supporters has reportedly displeased the former president, who has sided with Bondi, leaving Bongino's position at the bureau appearing untenable. The incident has split factions within the administration and the broader movement.</p>
