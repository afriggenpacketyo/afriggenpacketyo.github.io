          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Russia's response to Iran's request for assistance is being closely monitored. Analysts suggest that Russia may be limited in its capacity or willingness to help, as it requires its own resources for the war in Ukraine. Maintaining positive relations with the US, particularly with a potentially more Russia-friendly Trump administration, is also a factor in Moscow's cautious approach. So far, Russia has called for peaceful negotiations between Iran and Israel, signaling a desire to avoid direct involvement in the escalating crisis. Russia's response has been muted, showing the delicate balance it is trying to maintain between its alliances and geopolitical interests.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley expressed his shock and frustration over a planned protest in support of Palestine Action in London. This comes after Palestine Action activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed military planes with red paint, protesting the UK's support of Israel. Home Secretary is expected to present a written statement to Parliament to proscribe the group as a terrorist organization. While emphasizing the importance of the right to protest, Sir Mark condemned Palestine Action as an "organised extremist criminal group," stating that the Met will impose conditions to prevent disorder and disruption. Counter-terrorism police are investigating the RAF Brize Norton break-in, and reactions to the potential ban of Palestine Action have been mixed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to block the Strait of Hormuz in response to recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts warn that this action could alienate neighboring countries and key trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. Closing the strait could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, prompting calls from Washington for Beijing to intervene. While the decision now rests with Iran's national security council, analysts believe the possibility of closure remains low due to the potential for self-inflicted harm to Iran's economy and international relations. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz would be a very bad idea for Iran, as it would make it a target for US and Israeli attacks.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has expressed support for the U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear sites, signaling Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan understands the U.S. action as a determination to de-escalate the situation while preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Japan, which relies heavily on Middle Eastern crude oil, has traditionally maintained amicable ties with Iran while upholding its security alliance with the United States. The government is closely monitoring the impact of the Middle East conflict on Japan's energy supply, especially considering Iran's parliament's backing of closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane. Japan hopes that the path to dialogue will be reopened between the United States and Iran, and vows all necessary diplomatic efforts in cooperation with the international community toward peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained the wife of a Marine Corps veteran during a routine immigration appointment in New Orleans, sparking outrage. Adrian Clouatre's wife, Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, was detained despite being the mother of a breastfeeding infant. The detention highlights the Trump administration's strict immigration enforcement policies, which have removed deference previously afforded to military families. Advocates argue that the agency should exercise more discretion in such cases, especially considering the veteran's service and the family's efforts to pursue legal status. The case has drawn attention to the broader issue of immigration enforcement and its impact on military families.</p>

          <p>Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have increased uncertainty in global markets, as analysts warn that a potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher crude prices, intensify U.S. inflation, and complicate the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military had "totally obliterated" three of Iran's nuclear sites, prompting Tehran to threaten U.S. bases and the Strait of Hormuz, which is critical for global oil supplies. Experts suggest that gold could benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively shielded. If Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices could surge significantly, further destabilizing the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by supporting key industries and lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending.

Russia's economy minister has warned of an impending recession, while some observers suggest a potential collapse. While the unemployment rate remains low, economists predict a mild downturn characterized by defaults and bankruptcies. Sanctions continue to hinder technology imports, and declining oil and gas revenues have widened the budget shortfall, impacting infrastructure and public services. (not investment advice)</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait, given China's significant oil imports from Iran. The world is bracing for Iran's response to the U.S. strikes.</p>

Despite speculation about his involvement in high-profile crimes, Palmer's family is seeking answers and justice. Police believe that loyalties within the criminal underworld may have shifted, encouraging individuals to come forward with information.

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression. Ketamine, known recreationally but also as a medical anaesthetic, could be offered as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). A private clinic in Lanarkshire already offers ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, combining infusions with psychotherapy. While Esketamine, a nasal spray form of ketamine, is approved for moderate to severe depression, intravenous ketamine is not routinely licensed but can be prescribed off-label. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine and other psychedelics later this year.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. joins Israel in attacking Iran, Western leaders are calling for diplomacy but are failing to address the root cause of the conflict. The response from mainstream liberal parties is seen as inadequate and dissonant with the gravity of the situation. These leaders are criticized for their reluctance to challenge Israel's actions and for perpetuating a status quo of unconditional support. They are accused of upholding a world order of failing assumptions and hierarchies, while international and human rights law is violated. The article argues that this approach reflects a lack of moral compass and a disregard for human life.</p>

While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, achieving the proposed 5% of GDP target for defense spending remains a challenge. The German government supports allocating 3.5% of GDP to defense and 1.5% to security-related infrastructure by 2032. The Bundeswehr needs to recruit additional soldiers, but faces questions about how to attract tens of thousands of new personnel.
