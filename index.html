          <p>Janet Jackson received the Icon Award and performed live on television for the first time in seven years at the 2025 American Music Awards. Jackson, who turned 59 earlier in May, performed her hits "Someone to Call My Lover" and "All For You" before accepting the award, which she dedicated to her family and fellow artists. She emphasized that her family's dream was never to be famous, but to share their love for music and dance, and she hopes to inspire others to follow their dreams through hard work and dedication. Jackson's career suffered a setback after the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, but she has since made a comeback, including a Vegas residency and continued chart success.</p>

          <p>President Trump proposed reallocating $3 billion in grant money previously frozen or withdrawn from Harvard University to fund trade schools nationwide. Trump accused Harvard of being slow to respond to requests for information on "foreign student lists," seeking to identify potentially radicalized individuals. Harvard is currently engaged in legal battles with the White House to reinstate frozen grants and contracts, as well as to protect its ability to admit international students. The proposed shift in funding would divert resources from scientific research at Harvard, including studies on diseases, to vocational training programs.</p>

          <p>Japanese distillers are increasingly producing craft gin using local ingredients, contributing to a domestic gin boom. Domestic shipments of gin have risen significantly since 2019, driven by small-scale distillers incorporating homegrown botanicals and local specialties. Distillers are leveraging existing equipment for whiskey and shochu production to quickly monetize gin production. This trend has led to the rise of dedicated gin bars and e-commerce sites, with major manufacturers also entering the market with sugar-free canned gin products.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has called on doctors in England to vote against industrial action in an upcoming ballot, emphasizing the potential harm to the NHS. Streeting encouraged resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, to collaborate with the government and cautioned that strikes could impede progress in the NHS. Resident doctors are set to receive an average pay rise of 5.4% this year, but the union is advocating for industrial action to address below-inflation pay awards since 2008. Streeting agreed to a previous 22% pay rise over two years shortly after taking office.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding, shifting the focus to individuals under 21 years old. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now only be available for those under 21, with employers expected to fully fund higher-level training for older individuals. The government aims to create 120,000 additional training opportunities for young adults and those needing to retrain, while critics argue that the changes will negatively impact advanced training and access to professions for those who don't attend university. The initiative includes new foundation apprenticeships in sectors like healthcare, engineering, and construction.</p>

The campaign has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displacing much of the population, while concerns grow over food shortages and the effectiveness of humanitarian aid efforts. A new aid system, supported by Israel and the U.S. but rejected by U.N. agencies, is expected to begin operations.</p>

Russia's recent attacks have broken records for aerial bombardments, while Putin appears determined to capture more territory. The Kremlin downplayed Trump's remarks, but some European leaders hoped the shift in tone would translate into action, calling for tighter sanctions and a firm deadline for a ceasefire.</p>

The trend is attributed to economic uncertainty caused by Trump's tariff war, leading to a "Trump slump" in the tourism industry.
