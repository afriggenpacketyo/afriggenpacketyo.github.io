          <p>A BBC Midlands investigation successfully exposed drug dealers utilizing Snapchat to sell vapes containing "spice" to unsuspecting teenagers, often falsely advertised as THC. Undercover reporters, including one posing as a schoolgirl, easily arranged purchases, highlighting the alarming accessibility of these dangerous substances to young people. The investigation was prompted by parents whose teenage daughters suffered severe addiction and health consequences after unknowingly consuming spice-laced vapes, with one mother fearing for her child's life due to severe withdrawal symptoms. This article details how the dealers were identified and confronted, prompting Snapchat to reiterate its policy of removing millions of drug-related posts and accounts, while Warwickshire Police confirmed an ongoing evidence-gathering operation.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm, is currently churning in the Pacific Ocean and heading west-northwest towards Hawaii. Forecasters anticipate the storm will continue strengthening before a slow weakening begins, with swells expected to reach the Hawaiian Islands by the weekend, bringing life-threatening surf and rip currents. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to monitor updates and prepare for potential direct impacts like heavy rainfall and flooding early next week. The National Weather Service in Honolulu is closely tracking Kiko's path, emphasizing the importance of preparedness for this significant weather event.</p>

          <p>An Orange County woman, Laura Lee Yourex, faces five felony charges for allegedly registering her deceased dog, Maya Jean Yourex, to vote and casting ballots in its name in two elections. Prosecutors claim Yourex bragged about this "paw-litical fraud" on social media, even posting a photo of her dog with an "I Voted" sticker. While the 2021 recall election ballot was accepted due to state election rules, the 2022 primary ballot was rejected, highlighting vulnerabilities in the voter registration system. This article details the charges, which include perjury and procuring a false document, carrying a potential sentence of up to six years in state prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Austin officials unveiled a new $1.1 million unified city logo, a wavy blue and green "A," which has quickly drawn significant backlash from residents and critics. Republican Congressman Chip Roy blasted the rebrand as "woke" and a misallocation of funds, arguing the city should prioritize public safety over symbolic projects. The city manager defended the initiative, stating it aims to unify over 300 existing department logos, with a gradual rollout planned to minimize budget impact. However, online reactions have been largely negative, comparing the design to a "homeless tent" or a "bad biotech company's rebranding," despite some minimalist defenders.</p>

The Glória funicular, a popular 140-year-old tourist attraction, crashed into a building, prompting a large-scale rescue operation. Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro declared a national day of mourning, calling it one of the country's biggest human tragedies. An independent investigation has been launched by Carris, the public transport operator, to determine the cause of the accident, with initial statements confirming all maintenance protocols were followed.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated his commitment to running for re-election, rejecting reports that President Donald Trump's advisors proposed him for an ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia to exit the race.

Trump had suggested Cuomo as the best challenger to frontrunner Zohran Mamdani.

This operation, described as the largest enforcement action at a single site by HSI, stems from a monthslong investigation into unlawful employment practices.

          <p>AI chatbot developer Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement with authors in a copyright infringement lawsuit, signaling a pivotal shift in how AI companies may compensate creators. The agreement, awaiting judicial approval, will provide authors with approximately $3,000 per work for an estimated 500,000 books used to train Anthropic's Claude chatbot. While a judge initially ruled the training use as "fair use," the settlement addresses the improper downloading of millions of books from pirated online libraries. This article highlights the precedent set for other tech giants facing similar lawsuits, pushing towards a market-based licensing scheme for training data and affirming creators' rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will host the 2026 G20 summit, marking the first time in nearly 20 years the event will be held in the U.S. Trump plans to host the summit at his Doral golf resort in southern Florida, a decision that revives criticism similar to his first term's attempt to host the G7 at the same location, which was later abandoned due to conflict of interest concerns. This article notes Trump's assertion that there is "no money in it" for him, and his openness to inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as observers. Trump also confirmed he will skip this year's G20 summit in Johannesburg.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is evolving beyond a security forum into a platform offering significant economic and political alternatives to the Western-led order, primarily driven by China's multipolar ambitions. The SCO now encompasses 40% of the world's population and 23% of global nominal GDP, with stronger growth momentum than the G7, notably from India and China. The article suggests this expansion, including new members like Iran, indicates a maturing multipolar platform that is prompting the U.S. to react.
