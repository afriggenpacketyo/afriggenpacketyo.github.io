          <p>Australians cast their votes in a general election amidst a backdrop of economic challenges and evolving geopolitical dynamics. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite Australia's historical reputation as a recession-proof nation. While the Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is projected to secure a second term, there's a noticeable shift towards independent candidates and minor parties, reflecting dissatisfaction with the major parties' approaches to addressing pressing issues. The article also touches on cultural divides and the influence of global politics, including comparisons to Trumpian policies, on the Australian political scene.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has aided scientists in developing an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies in Friede's blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. This work could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom, potentially saving up to 140,000 lives annually and preventing numerous amputations and disabilities caused by snakebites. The research identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies capable of targeting two classes of neurotoxins, offering hope for a more effective treatment for snakebite victims worldwide.</p>

Romero's victory earned him the WBA welterweight title and potentially opened the door for a fight with Haney. The article notes that Haney also won his fight against Jose Ramirez, but Garcia's loss throws the rematch into doubt.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. While President Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariff is intended to push carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US. Analysts predict that any immediate expansions in the US would likely come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for businesses and ultimately higher prices for consumers. Concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge, but some companies have warned of increased costs and uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned as a symbol of unity and gratitude to God, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground. The project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to funding issues and corruption accusations, with only a large hole remaining on the construction site. The new government has halted funding and launched an anticorruption initiative, leaving the future of the cathedral uncertain amidst Ghana's economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Russia lacks a formal system to account for soldiers missing in the Ukraine war, leaving families to search for their loved ones with little government assistance. The Ministry of Defense has not published statistics on the missing, and estimates suggest tens of thousands are unaccounted for. Families face bureaucratic hurdles, and many believe their loved ones were left on the battlefield due to a lack of resources for body retrieval. The International Committee of the Red Cross has over 110,000 cases submitted related to missing persons from both sides of the conflict.</p>
