          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, who was stabbed to death by his neighbor in Canning Town, London, states he was "failed by London." They, along with other residents, had made numerous complaints about the perpetrator's aggressive and anti-social behavior to the police and council, but feel insufficient action was taken to protect him. The killer, Daniel Whybrow, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder, which occurred during a dispute over a communal door. The family has been unable to return home since the traumatic event.</p>

While Japan's Nikkei 225 is expected to open higher, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures point to a lower opening. Market participants are also closely watching for the release of China's trade data for August for further economic indicators. This follows a weak end to the previous week for U.S. markets, which closed lower on concerns about a slowing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The baby, named Henry James, is healthy and was wrapped in a football shirt by family members before paramedics arrived.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a back injury that sidelined him for much of the preseason, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 victory against the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, also surpassing 60,000 career passing yards during the game. The Rams' defense was crucial, limiting the Texans to three field goals and securing the win with a late-game fumble recovery. The victory marks a positive start for the Rams in coach Sean McVay's ninth season.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of couples "living apart together" (LAT) through the story of Margaret, who has lived in London for 15 years while her husband, Peter, resides in Australia. Despite the distance, they maintain a strong and faithful marriage, communicating regularly and visiting each other annually. This arrangement allowed Margaret to pursue a new career and life in her late 50s after her children left home. Experts note that while not for everyone, such arrangements can provide space and help partners maintain their individual identities within a marriage.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, aiming to restore and reopen the beloved attraction ahead of its centennial in 2026. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been mostly closed since 2022 following the death of its operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few of its kind still in existence and requires significant repairs before it can operate again. The acquisition is part of a broader restoration plan for the park.</p>

          <p>Investors are looking beyond US equities for the first time in a decade amid a weakening US dollar and likely easing of US monetary policy, moving capital into Asia as they chase the artificial intelligence boom in the region, according to the head of global research at Bank of America (BofA). Ahead of the three-day BofA Securities Asia Pacific Conference starting on Monday, Candace Browning said that US equities had been exceptional from the first half of 2020 to the end of 2024, attracting US$1.2 trillion from global investors, compared with US$200 billion for the rest of the world during the same period. However, the investments have slowed down this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Bank of America's head of global research, global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, redirecting capital toward Asia.

Analysts note that Asian markets offer more attractive valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks. The global AI market is projected to grow significantly, with a substantial portion of that investment expected to be deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

After Boswell successfully kicked a 60-yard field goal to secure the lead, Tomlin described him as a "serial killer" due to his calm demeanor and "low-pulse rate" in high-pressure situations. Boswell has been a reliable kicker for the Steelers since 2015, earning his first All-Pro selection last season.

The event was visible across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa, captivating stargazers. Scientists explain the reddish hue is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere, where shorter blue wavelengths are dispersed more easily, allowing longer red wavelengths to reach the moon.

The potential deployment of federal agents or the National Guard has heightened tensions in Black and Latino communities, where trust in law enforcement is already low.

With this victory, the 22-year-old Spaniard will reclaim the top ranking and has now won six Grand Slam titles, making him the second-youngest man in the Open era to do so. The final was delayed due to heightened security for President Trump's attendance.

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues President Trump is Largely Irrelevant to the Economy and Stock Picking</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer posits that while President Donald Trump dominates media headlines, his direct impact on the economy and stock market is minimal, making it an unproductive focus for investors. He analyzes the recent weak jobs report, suggesting that while some job losses can be tied to administration policies like government downsizing, the overall economic picture is more complex. Cramer concludes that factors like Federal Reserve policy and individual company performance are far more important for investors to follow. He advises viewers to focus on company conference calls rather than political rhetoric to make money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California state bill aimed at establishing safe, overnight parking programs for homeless community college students is unlikely to pass this legislative session. The bill, AB 90, was intended to provide secure lots and access to facilities for the significant number of students living in their vehicles. However, it was held in a Senate committee and did not advance, largely due to concerns about the high cost of implementation, estimated at $40-50 million statewide. Some college districts opposed the bill, arguing they prefer to connect students with direct housing services rather than parking programs.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as Hong Kong rebounds from recent challenges, it must solidify its status as an international financial hub that is distinct from mainland China. The author points to the return of tourists and a booming IPO market as signs of recovery, suggesting the city benefits from its unique "in-between" status. To secure its future, the piece suggests Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support Hong Kong as a base for multilateral institutions. This would help the city balance its integration with China's economy while preserving the global appeal that underpins its success.</p>

The comments come as the administration asks the Supreme Court to overturn a federal appeals court ruling that found the tariffs illegal.
