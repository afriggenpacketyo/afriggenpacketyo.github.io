          <p>Nike announced that it anticipates an incremental cost of approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year due to U.S. tariffs, a new challenge in its ongoing business turnaround. Despite beating diminished Wall Street expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings, the company's profits fell 86% as it cleared out old inventory. To mitigate the tariff impact, Nike plans to shift more of its supply chain out of China, work with partners, and implement price increases, signaling that while the worst of its reset may be over, significant headwinds remain.

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the 90-day pause on his administration's so-called reciprocal tariffs, which is currently set to expire on July 9. A spokeswoman stated the deadline was "not critical" and that an extension was possible, signaling a degree of flexibility in ongoing trade negotiations. The remarks came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, as Japan and other U.S. trading partners seek concessions on the higher duties imposed by the Trump administration.

Macías, who is also wanted by the United States, was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape from a Guayaquil prison in early 2024 plunged the nation into a state of crisis, triggering riots, kidnappings, and a declaration of war between the government and criminal gangs. His arrest marks a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's security crackdown.</p>
