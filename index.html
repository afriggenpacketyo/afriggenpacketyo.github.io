          <p>The Israeli military has ordered residents and displaced people in Deir al-Balah, a city in central Gaza, to evacuate, signaling a potential ground offensive in an area previously untouched by ground troops. This move has sparked panic among tens of thousands of Palestinians and families of Israeli hostages believed to be held there. The evacuation order comes as the 21-month war continues, with reports of deadly Israeli fire at aid distribution points and a growing humanitarian crisis. The conflict, which began after the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 58,000 deaths in Gaza, according to the local health ministry.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck off Russia's Pacific coast, initially prompting tsunami warnings for the Kamchatka Peninsula and a watch for Hawaii. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Russian authorities later confirmed that the danger had passed, and there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage. The largest quake occurred at a depth of 20 kilometers, east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. This event recalls a massive 9.0 magnitude quake in 1952 that caused large waves in Hawaii but no reported deaths in Kamchatka.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Nathalia Holt's new book, "The Beast in the Clouds," details the 1928 expedition of Theodore Roosevelt's sons, Ted and Kermit, into China. Their mission was to find and capture a giant panda, a creature so rare and mysterious at the time that its existence was debated. The book explores the era's spirit of discovery, when explorers sought to fill museums with specimens of the world's large mammals. The panda was the last major prize, and the Roosevelt brothers embarked on a treacherous journey into unmapped territory to claim it.</p>

          <p>A cast member of the opera "Il trovatore" at London's Royal Opera House staged a protest during the final curtain call by unfurling a large Palestinian flag. Video of the incident shows an official attempting to take the flag, but the performer resisted and continued the display. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the act as "completely inappropriate" and "unauthorised," emphasizing its commitment to political impartiality. The protest is one of many public displays of support for Gaza amid the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.</p>

          <p>Scientists and health agencies are highlighting the increased risk of vibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio bacteria, in European coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas. The bacteria thrive in warmer, low-salinity water, conditions becoming more common due to climate change. Infections, which can be contracted by eating raw shellfish or swimming with open wounds, can cause severe illness and, in rare cases, be fatal. To stay safe, officials advise cooking shellfish thoroughly and avoiding swimming in these waters with any cuts or sores, as infections are rising during summer heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A recent Vox article delves into the political interpretations of Superman, prompted by conservative criticism of director James Gunn's description of the character as an "immigrant." The article interviews Grant Morrison, author of "All-Star Superman," who argues that the character's creators, sons of Jewish immigrants, originally conceived him as a "socialist figure" and "champion of the oppressed." The analysis traces Superman's evolution from a 1930s social crusader who fought corrupt bosses to a patriotic symbol during wartime and a more domesticated figure in the 1950s. This history reveals a character that has consistently reflected and adapted to the changing American social and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused some council officials of deliberately obstructing the work of his party's newly elected councillors. Speaking to the BBC, Farage claimed that in some of the 10 councils where Reform gained control in May, his councillors are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies that are resistant to change. He specifically cited Warwickshire, where the party's plan to hire political assistants has faced criticism, as an example of this obstructionism.

          <p>In a commentary piece, Austin Sarat argues that pro-democracy forces must learn from Donald Trump's political strategies to effectively oppose him. The author contends that Trump has demonstrated a political genius for shaping narratives, transforming errors into advantages, and mobilizing a loyal base, achieving significant policy shifts in a short time. To counter this, the article suggests that opponents should adopt a simple, repetitive messaging style, show more determination and grit, and build a grassroots movement outside of established political norms. The piece concludes that defending democracy requires not just preserving the system, but offering a compelling vision for its reform.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to conduct their first joint army training exercise, a move that signals deepening military and economic ties between the two neighbors. The Chinese Ministry of Defence announced the drill will take place in the Guangxi region, which borders Vietnam, and will focus on joint border patrol training. This development comes as both nations navigate the impacts of the U.S. trade war. The closer cooperation is part of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations and follows Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent visit to Vietnam, where he advocated for unity against "unilateral bullying."</p>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in the Italian Alps in 2023, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows a lengthy legal battle and protests from animal rights groups, which successfully prevented the bear from being euthanized as originally ordered by local authorities. The bear, also called Gaia, arrived safely at the Alternative Wolf and Bear Park, where she will live in a specially constructed, secure enclosure. The case has highlighted the growing issue of human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has significantly increased.</p>

          <p>A rare fossil discovery in northeastern China is challenging previous beliefs about the diet of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles of the dinosaur era. Researchers found the fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterosaur, with its stomach contents intact for the first time. The stomach contained phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants, along with small quartz crystals likely used as gastroliths to help grind the plant matter. Published in Science Bulletin, this finding provides the first direct evidence of herbivory in this group of pterosaurs, renewing a long-standing debate among paleontologists about what these ancient creatures ate.</p>

          <p>A monument in Mexico City commemorating the first meeting between revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Ernesto "Che" Guevara has been abruptly removed, igniting a political and ideological debate. The sculpture, installed in 2017, was taken down by the conservative borough president of the Cuauhtémoc district, who cited a lack of permits and later called the figures individuals who "injured human dignity." The removal was praised by critics of the Cuban regime but condemned by leftists, including Mexico's president, who argued the monument represents a significant historical moment that occurred in the city. The controversy echoes ongoing global debates about the role of historical monuments.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case contains all the key elements of a classic, enduring conspiracy theory, blending known facts with deep-seated distrust in institutions. The narrative involves a wealthy, powerful sex offender with connections to global elites, a lenient plea deal, and a mysterious death in custody. This has fueled speculation, particularly within the MAGA movement, about a hidden list of clients protected by a "deep state." The Trump administration's shifting stance on releasing Epstein-related files has only intensified these suspicions, creating a complex situation where the president, who often leverages conspiracies, now finds himself trying to quell one among his own supporters.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump's major foreign policy promises, which he claimed his "force of personality" could achieve, have not materialized. Pledges to quickly end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, halt Iran's nuclear program, and negotiate numerous trade deals remain unfulfilled. While there have been some achievements, such as increased NATO defense spending, his approach has often overestimated his influence and underestimated the complexity of global issues. For example, after failing to persuade Vladimir Putin to accept a peace deal, Trump has reversed course and will resume selling missiles to support Ukraine.</p>

A poor showing could lead to calls for Ishiba to resign.

Using the James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, researchers studied the gas disk surrounding the infant star HOPS-315, located about 1,370 light-years away. They detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in a region analogous to our solar system's asteroid belt.
