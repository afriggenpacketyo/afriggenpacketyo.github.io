          <p>Saturday's UK newspapers are dominated by Reform UK's local election gains and Prince Harry's BBC interview. The Daily Mail highlights the "Reform revolution" and Prince Harry's comments about King Charles. The Times also splits its front page between these stories, noting Farage's confidence and Starmer's critique of Reform's policies. The Daily Telegraph features a striking image of Farage and Badenoch's reaction to the results, while the Daily Express leads with Prince Harry's "bombshell interview." The Sun focuses on Prince Harry's "incendiary attack," and the Daily Mirror emphasizes his concerns about the King's health. The i weekend reports Reform UK's pledges to cut spending and the Financial Times describes Reform UK's victories as a "populist insurgency."</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit argues that these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement, citing an apartment complex in Aurora allegedly taken over by a Venezuelan gang as an example. Local officials deny Trump's gang claims were exaggerated. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate laws that prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities, asserting they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>The US has implemented a 25% import tax on car parts, adding pressure to the automotive industry. While President Trump eased the measure slightly, it aims to encourage domestic manufacturing. Analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers despite a recent sales surge driven by concerns about price hikes. General Motors expects significant new costs due to the tariffs, while Stellantis withdrew financial guidance due to the uncertain situation. The tariffs do not apply to parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the existing free trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy.

The project is now a target of the new government's anticorruption initiative, with funding halted and the managing agency dissolved. Critics argue the cathedral is an unnecessary expense during Ghana's economic crisis, while supporters defend it as a potential profit-making monument.</p>

          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating an incident where an Army helicopter entered restricted airspace near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, causing two commercial flights to abort landings. The FAA and NTSB are investigating after air traffic controllers instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to abort their landings. The helicopter, a Black Hawk, was headed to the Pentagon. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed outrage, and Senator Ted Cruz called for improved air safety measures.</p>

Music journalist Caroline Sullivan suggests that Blue Ivy's success is tied to BeyoncÃ©'s popularity, though her talent also contributes. Other celebrity children, like North West, have also entered the music industry, facing similar scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to a reservoir being shut down for repairs, despite the city's attempts to prepare an alternative reservoir. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power explored reviving an old reservoir to boost water capacity, but the plan was never completed due to safety concerns. This undermined the potential water supply, leading to firefighters reporting dry hydrants. The inability to bring either reservoir back online seriously undermined the potential water supply in the area.
