          <p>Chris Brown pleaded not guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to a music producer in a London nightclub in 2023, with his friend Omololu Akinlolu also denying the same charge. Prosecutors allege Brown attacked Abe Diaw with a bottle in the Tape nightclub, an incident caught on surveillance. Brown was released on bail last month, allowing him to continue his world tour. The trial is set for October 2026, and Brown will need to adhere to bail conditions including residing at a UK address and surrendering his passport, though temporary passport returns are allowed for tour dates.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, with sales volumes falling by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decline was primarily attributed to a poor performance by food retailers, particularly supermarkets, with reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco. Separate figures revealed government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since 1993, with increased spending outweighing revenue from income tax and National Insurance contributions. Consumers are reportedly cutting back on spending due to inflation, with food prices continuing to rise.</p>

          <p>Credit card interest rates are increasing despite the Federal Reserve holding rates steady, with the average APR exceeding 20%. New cards now have an average APR of 24.3%, the highest level since December. Card issuers are reportedly mitigating risks against potential borrower defaults amid economic uncertainty. Consumers carrying balances from month to month will feel the impact of these high APRs, but even an eventual Fed rate cut may not provide significant relief, as the difference in interest rates may not be substantial.

The team is changing hands from the Buss family to an investment group led by Mark Walter.

          <p>A new study challenges the long-held hypothesis that birds sing at dawn due to better sound transmission conditions. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little support for the acoustic transmission hypothesis. Instead, the study suggests that early morning vocal activity relates to birds marking their territory and communicating about food. The findings indicate that environmental factors may not be the primary driver of the dawn chorus, shifting focus to behavioral and social explanations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's proactive approach to supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, offers valuable lessons amid China's export restrictions. Following a 2010 export ban by China, Japan diversified its rare earth sources, investing in projects like Australia's Lynas. This has reduced Japan's reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. The country's strategy includes stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies. This transformation serves as a reminder of the challenges in escaping China's critical mineral dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

Extreme heat has posed challenges for players and fans, leading to potential health risks. There have been reports of heightened security and political tensions, including the absence of an Iranian player due to regional conflicts.
