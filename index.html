          <p>Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled legislature from achieving a quorum needed to pass a new congressional map. The proposed redistricting plan, supported by Donald Trump, is criticized by Democrats as a partisan gerrymander designed to unfairly secure more seats for the GOP in future elections. This action halts a special legislative session called by Governor Greg Abbott, which also included topics like disaster relief for recent floods. The Democrats argue they are defending the democratic process against a system rigged to suppress voter influence, a tactic they have used in previous legislative standoffs.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, causing brief shaking that was felt across parts of the New York City metropolitan area. The U.S. Geological Survey located the epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the event startled residents, with some reporting it felt like a loud boom or an impact against their house, no significant damage or injuries were reported. Officials noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered a major event and is not expected to cause structural issues, offering reassurance to the public.</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Jeffrey Sachs expressed concern that aggressive posturing by the United States toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to war. He commented on the ongoing trade frictions, noting that both nations have economic leverage over the other, which might enforce limits on their competition. Sachs suggested that while a complete resolution is unlikely during the current administration, mutual interests in trade could encourage rationality. He also advised that from a long-term perspective, China should focus on expanding its exports to markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and Europe.

          <p>Rescuers at the El Teniente copper mine in Chile have recovered the body of the final missing worker, bringing the total number of miners killed in a tunnel collapse to five. The incident, which also killed another person at the time of the collapse, was triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, has expressed its condolences as authorities launch a criminal investigation into the tragedy. The focus of the investigation will be to determine whether the tremor was a natural event or induced by mining activities at the world's largest underground copper mine.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in centuries, just days after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. The eruption sent a plume of ash and gas thousands of feet into the air, prompting an aviation alert. Officials at the local nature reserve stated that the event poses no current threat to the sparsely populated area. Seismologists suggest the earthquake could have triggered the eruption, explaining that while the quake itself may not be the sole cause, its seismic waves could have destabilized a volcanic system that was already close to erupting.</p>

          <p>A boat collided with a 20-foot minke whale off the Jersey Shore, resulting in the death of the marine mammal and sending one passenger overboard into Barnegat Bay. Officials reported that the person thrown into the water was not seriously injured. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center responded to the incident after the whale was later found deceased in shallow water. A necropsy is planned to determine the exact cause of death, and boaters have been advised to maintain a safe distance from the carcass. The event highlights the potential dangers of encounters between vessels and marine wildlife in busy waterways.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson did not advance to the 200m final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, narrowly missing a qualifying spot by one-hundredth of a second. This result ends her bid to compete in the 200m event at the upcoming World Championships. The outcome concludes a difficult week for Richardson, who was arrested days earlier in connection with a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend. Despite this setback, she will still compete in the 100m event at the World Championships, as she has an automatic entry as the defending champion in that discipline.</p>

His comments followed a disappointing qualifying session and fueled speculation, though he affirmed his commitment to continue racing with Ferrari. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged Hamilton's frustration but expressed confidence in his return to form, attributing the poor race result partly to a failed tire strategy. Despite recent struggles, analysis shows Hamilton remains competitive with his teammate, and team leadership believes he can still contend for championships with an improved car.</p>

          <p>Police have shut down an unlicensed music event, or illegal rave, that drew a large crowd to Myherin forest in Ceredigion, Wales. Officers from Dyfed-Powys Police attended the gathering in the early hours of Sunday after being alerted to the event near the Cefn Croes wind farm. Authorities monitored the situation throughout the day as attendees began to disperse. Officials warned that such unauthorized events can cause significant disruption, harm the local environment, and pose safety risks. An investigation into any criminal offenses related to the rave will be conducted by the police.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced new plans to combat illegal immigration by targeting people smugglers who use social media to advertise their services. Under the proposal, individuals facilitating illegal crossings of the English Channel online could face up to five years in prison. This move aims to give law enforcement more tools to dismantle criminal gangs that promote dangerous journeys to the UK. The plan comes as the government faces increasing pressure to address the record number of migrants arriving in small boats, a significant portion of whom reportedly use social media to arrange their travel.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals will be available in early September. This fund was established as part of recent legislation that also enacted significant cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about the financial viability of rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the funds are intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the adoption of technology like telehealth. The new law also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could cause 10 million people to lose coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on solid pitching and timely, small-ball offense rather than power hitting. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout. The Dodgers manufactured their runs through aggressive baserunning, a key double-steal, and a sacrifice fly, overcoming a recent team-wide slump at the plate. The victory secured a winning 5-4 record for the team on their nine-game road trip. The game also saw manager Dave Roberts experiment with the batting order, moving Shohei Ohtani back to the leadoff spot to spark the offense.</p>

Lacking traditional political backgrounds, they are campaigning on their experience as public servants and their commitment to upholding the rule of law, representing a unique trend of legal professionals moving into electoral politics.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were mis-sold car finance deals with hidden commissions. Following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed exceptionally high commissions unfair, the FCA plans to consult on a payout system that could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. While the court did not find all hidden commissions unlawful, this new scheme targets cases with excessive charges. The FCA anticipates that eligible customers will likely receive less than £950 per deal, with the first payouts expected next year for agreements dating back to 2007.</p>

The article details Ben-Gvir's history as a follower of a radical rabbi, his multiple convictions for offenses like racism, and his rise from a political outlier to one of Israel's most influential politicians, known for his ultranationalist and confrontational stances.</p>
