          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner and worship leader Sean Feucht co-hosted a faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall, marking a significant shift in federal engagement with Christian organizations. Turner emphasized that "faith is back in our government" under President Trump, highlighting the crucial role faith-based groups play in post-disaster recovery. The event, part of HUD's Innovative Housing Showcase, celebrated these organizations as vital partners, a notable change for Feucht, who previously faced opposition for his worship gatherings. Despite strong wind and rain, hundreds attended the "historic" event, showcasing a federally recognized platform for faith leaders.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Dodgers came within one out of a no-hitter before giving up a home run to Jackson Holliday, ending his bid for history. The game then unraveled for the Dodgers in the ninth inning, with reliever Blake Treinen loading the bases and Tanner Scott surrendering a two-run single for a 4-3 Orioles walk-off victory. This dramatic collapse left the Dodgers stunned and extended their losing streak to five games, highlighting their recent struggles in finding new ways to lose.

          <p>After a brief post-pandemic boom, China's private holiday accommodation sector is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving many operators regretting their investments. The initial surge in "revenge travel" demand quickly faded as an influx of new businesses led to intense price wars and falling profits. A report by Fastdata revealed that nearly 60% of operators now regret entering the market, with many finding themselves working for minimal wages despite pouring millions into their ventures. This article highlights the struggles of a sector caught in a classic boom-and-bust cycle, mirroring broader economic challenges in China.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to claim her second consecutive US Open title, marking her fourth Grand Slam trophy overall. The Belarusian player, who had lost two major finals earlier in the year, demonstrated improved emotional composure to secure the victory. Sabalenka's tactical approach involved absorbing Anisimova's powerful shots and forcing errors, ultimately dominating the tie-break after failing to serve out the match at 5-4 in the second set. This win signifies a significant emotional breakthrough for Sabalenka, who learned from her previous defeats to maintain calm under pressure.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Central Pacific, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, and is moving west-northwestward towards Hawaii.

Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare for potential direct impacts like heavy rainfall and flooding early next week.

          <p>Schools across the United States are increasingly implementing Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, aiming to reduce distractions and improve student engagement. The system, which requires students to lock their phones in pouches that can only be unlocked at designated stations, is now used by at least 2.5 million students in 35 states. Educators and parents report positive changes, including more in-person interaction and a greater focus on learning, despite initial skepticism and attempts by some students to bypass the system. The initiative seeks to foster a culture where students can experience life outside a "fully digital realm" and engage more directly with their education and peers.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a tariff exemption for low-cost imports. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reported that 88 postal operators worldwide have suspended service to the US for parcels valued at $800 or less, as the burden of customs duty collection now falls on carriers or approved parties. This abrupt change, implemented on August 29, 2025, caused major operational disruptions because airlines and foreign postal operators were unprepared to collect these duties. The article highlights concerns that the policy, intended to close a loophole, has severely impacted international mail flow.</p>

          <p>The European Union's new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), will be gradually introduced this autumn, starting October 12, to enhance security and streamline travel for non-EU citizens. The system, covering 29 Schengen Area countries, will replace manual passport stamping by requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks upon their first use. Concerns have been raised about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy hubs like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The EES registration will be valid for three years, aiming for smoother travel once fully implemented by April 2026.</p>

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic's new policy, restricting service to entities over 50% owned by companies headquartered in unsupported regions like China, has cast uncertainty over several Claude-dependent overseas AI tools. The abrupt decision, effective Friday, has caused anxiety among users of platforms such as ByteDance's Singapore-based code editor Trae, which relies on Claude models. While a Trae manager advised users against considering refunds "for the time being," the move highlights the escalating tech war and its impact on the global AI ecosystem. This article notes that other Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent, also offer Claude on their international coding agents.</p>

          <p>Singapore faces an existential threat from rising sea levels, projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100, potentially reaching 5 meters with storm surges. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized this as a "life and death matter," as 30% of the island nation lies less than 5 meters above mean sea level, endangering critical infrastructure. The article highlights that human-caused climate change is accelerating these events, making coastal floods more frequent and destructive. In response, Singapore is investing billions in coastal defenses like seawalls and land reclamation, alongside global efforts in clean energy and wetland restoration to combat the root causes.</p>

The party stated it does not endorse his views but supports free speech, despite strong condemnation from Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who called the claims "shockingly irresponsible."
