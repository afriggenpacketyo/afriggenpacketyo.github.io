            <p>Boise State's Ashton Jeanty, a top NFL Draft prospect and Heisman Trophy finalist, expresses unwavering confidence in his abilities, asserting he should be a top pick due to his elusiveness. Jeanty draws inspiration from Saquon Barkley's impact on the Eagles and believes he can bring a similar winning mentality and highlight-reel plays to an NFL franchise. He credits his family and unique experiences, including a period in Italy where he couldn't play football, for his adaptability and instincts on the field. Jeanty anticipates making an immediate impact in the league, aiming to lead his future team to victory and emulate Barkley's success.</p>

            <p>The CDC has reportedly cancelled plans to expand its measles response efforts in Texas schools, due to potential layoffs within the agency's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH experts had been conducting on-site ventilation assessments in Texas hospitals to identify and correct issues that could be spreading the virus. With many NIOSH staff facing layoffs or reassignments, the CDC feared deploying personnel who might be cut off from agency resources mid-assignment. This decision highlights the impact of agency restructuring on public health emergency response capabilities.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham, UK, are striking due to the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, which has led to pay disputes. Regular bin workers earn an average of £26,543 per year, while WRCOs earn between £26,409 and £32,654. The union, Unite, claims that the changes could result in some workers facing pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council argues that the maximum loss would be just over £6,000 and that the WRCO role is not 'safety critical'. A consultation on compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on April 3.</p>

            <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein are set to raise prices for US consumers starting April 25, citing increased operating expenses due to changes in global trade rules and tariffs. The price adjustments are a direct consequence of the 145% tariff imposed on most products made in China by President Trump, coupled with the end of a customs exemption for goods under US$800. This move signals the end of ultra-low prices that have allowed Temu and Shein to disrupt the Western retail market, potentially impacting consumer spending habits.</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione has been indicted on federal charges, including murder with a firearm, for the killing of UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson, making him eligible for the death penalty. Mangione is accused of stalking and shooting Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel in December 2024. Attorney General Pam Bondi has signaled her intention to pursue the death penalty, citing President Trump's agenda to combat violent crime. The defense argues that Bondi's statement prejudiced the grand jury process and is seeking to prevent the death penalty from being pursued.</p>

            <p>Japan's inflation rate reached 3.6% year-on-year in March, surpassing the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) 2% target for the third consecutive year. While this figure is slightly lower than February's 3.7%, the "core-core" inflation rate, excluding fresh food and energy, rose to 2.9%. The data release coincides with ongoing trade talks between Japan and the U.S., where tariffs from the U.S. loom. Analysts at Nomura expect only one rate hike by the BOJ between now and March 2027 due to potential downward pressure on Japan's GDP from the Trump tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The FDA is reportedly considering plans to end its routine food safety inspections, outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. This shift could free up FDA resources to focus on higher-priority and foreign inspections, though some higher-risk inspections would likely remain under federal control. The move has garnered support from some states and advocacy groups, who argue that states can often conduct inspections at a lower cost while maintaining standards. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on food safety and the resources needed for a successful transition.</p>

            <p>Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, advocates for a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" where nations benefiting from US security and economic support contribute more to the system. Miran contends that the US has long borne the costs of providing global public goods, including military security and a stable financial system centered around the US dollar. This stance signals a consolidation of Trump's protectionist economic vision and a shift towards demanding greater financial responsibility from US allies.</p>
