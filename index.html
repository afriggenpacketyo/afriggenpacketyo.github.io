          <p>The rising popularity of weight-loss injections like Ozempic and Wegovy is highlighting a growing disparity between those who can afford them privately and those who cannot access them through the NHS. While these drugs offer significant potential for treating obesity, strict NHS eligibility criteria and regional inconsistencies have created what some call a "postcode lottery." This situation raises concerns that health outcomes could become increasingly tied to wealth, as an estimated 90% of UK users pay for the drugs out-of-pocket, potentially worsening existing health inequalities linked to deprivation.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's long-stated goal of winning an away Ryder Cup was achieved at Bethpage Black, even as he lost his final day singles match to Scottie Scheffler. The article details the immense physical and emotional toll of the event on McIlroy, who faced a hostile crowd throughout the competition. Despite his individual loss on Sunday, his overall performance during the week was crucial to Europe's success. The match itself was uncharacteristically error-prone for both top-ranked players, reflecting the exhaustion and pressure of the three-day tournament.</p>

          <p>The New York Mets' playoff aspirations officially ended with a 4-0 loss to the Miami Marlins on the final day of the regular season. This defeat marks the culmination of a dramatic collapse for a team that held the best record in the majors as recently as mid-June. With a major-league high payroll, the team's failure to secure a postseason berth is a significant disappointment. The loss handed the final National League wildcard spot to the Cincinnati Reds, who owned the head-to-head tiebreaker over New York.</p>

          <p>An individual was found dead inside the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight after it arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Europe. Maintenance crews discovered the body during a routine check on Sunday morning. Aviation experts note that stowing away in a plane's wheel well is almost always fatal due to the extreme conditions at high altitudes, including lack of oxygen and temperatures dropping as low as minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department is investigating the incident, and airport operations were not disrupted.</p>

          <p>A new record has been set for the most people crossing the English Channel in a single small boat, with a vessel carrying 125 individuals arriving on Saturday. This surpasses the previous record of 106 people set in August. The crossing was part of a larger movement that saw 895 migrants arrive in 12 boats on the same day. The news comes as French authorities report another migrant death near Boulogne-sur-Mer, bringing the total number of deaths from crossing attempts this year to at least 27.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has described President Trump's recent allegation that the FBI placed agents in the crowd as "agitators" during the January 6 Capitol riot as "appalling." Speaking on Sunday, Klobuchar emphasized that law enforcement was called in to provide needed assistance during the insurrection, not to incite it. She pointed to a previous Inspector General report that found no evidence of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowds. The senator, who led a bipartisan investigation into the attack, stated that the claim was baseless and contradicted all available facts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a government shutdown this week could lead to permanent layoffs for many federal employees, a significant departure from the typical practice of furloughing workers. In an interview, Trump stated his administration would "cut a lot of the people that we're able to cut on a permanent basis." This warning follows a memo from the White House to federal agencies last week, instructing them to prepare for mass firings if Congress fails to pass a funding deal before the deadline.
