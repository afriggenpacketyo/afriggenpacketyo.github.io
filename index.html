            <p>A federal judge has rebuked the Trump administration for failing to secure the return of a man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The US Supreme Court had ordered the administration to facilitate the release and return of Kilmar Ábrego García. This incident is part of a series of legal challenges faced by the Trump administration regarding immigration policies. Immigration authorities have also reportedly deported a Venezuelan teenager despite realizing that he was not the person they intended to arrest.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans across Southern California are being affected by a toxic algae bloom, leading to a dual crisis of sickness and starvation. Adult pelicans are being poisoned by domoic acid, while baby pelicans are struggling to survive due to the illness or death of their parents. Wildlife rehabilitation centers are overwhelmed with sick and starving birds, and experts believe the situation is linked to changes in ocean nutrient levels, potentially exacerbated by runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm and climate change.</p>
