          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, highlighting the Japanese company's $14 billion investment during a speech in Pennsylvania. He emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain under American control, though details of the deal are still pending final approval. Trump also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50%, aiming to bolster the U.S. steel industry and national security. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, but the specifics of the agreement remain unclear as discussions continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the weekend series against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe at home. Betts sustained the injury while walking in the dark, hitting his toe on a wall, and is experiencing pain that makes wearing a shoe difficult. Manager Dave Roberts is hopeful that Betts will avoid the injured list, expecting him to be available to hit in a big spot, and that it will be a day-to-day situation based on his pain tolerance.

          <p>A U.S. court ruling has challenged President Trump's authority to impose blanket tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), citing that the administration's use of the act exceeded its granted powers. The ruling, which was temporarily stayed, has created uncertainty for businesses navigating the global economy under Trump's trade policies. Despite the setback, the administration maintains it has a strong case and will find alternative methods to implement tariffs if necessary. The situation adds another layer of confusion to international trade, with businesses awaiting clarity on the final outcome.</p>

          <p>A knife attack at Hamburg's main train station, where a Syrian teenager named Muhammad al-Muhammad helped stop the assailant, has become the target of a disinformation campaign. Manipulated images and false narratives are circulating online, aiming to discredit al-Muhammad's heroism and undermine trust in the media. These efforts exploit anti-immigrant sentiments and create confusion about the actual events, with some questioning the accuracy of media reports and the existence of al-Muhammad himself.

The movement seeks to reshape the European project with its own brand of conservativism, while some mainstream European conservatives remain distant.

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice, with consumers quickly purchasing the cheaper products. The government's effort aims to alleviate the financial burden on households facing rising rice costs, with 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 being made available. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes that direct sales to retailers will be more effective in curbing rice prices compared to previous auction attempts.</p>

The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a similar recommendation in 2022.

          <p>President Trump's tax bill, including a proposed tax on remittances leaving the US, is expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a vital source of income for many African families, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. The tax could lead migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, reducing transparency and potentially harming lower-income groups reliant on these funds. While the full impact remains uncertain due to data limitations, experts warn that the policy could squeeze migrants and their families, especially in countries heavily dependent on remittances.</p>
