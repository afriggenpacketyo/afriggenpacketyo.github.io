          <p>Gold is currently priced at $3,395.31 per ounce, maintaining its status as a significant investment commodity and a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty. The article explains that the value of gold is subject to constant change due to a variety of interconnected factors. These influences include fundamental supply and demand, broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Central bank policies and overall market sentiment also play a crucial role in the precious metal's price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but market watchers anticipating a cut in September, financial experts are urging savers to act quickly. They recommend locking in current high-interest rates, such as the 4% or more offered by high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). The article outlines various options, including liquid high-yield accounts for emergency funds and fixed-rate CDs or government-backed Treasurys for those with a defined savings timeline. These strategies aim to maximize returns on cash before rates potentially decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring plans to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C., to address what it describes as a surge in violent crime and to remove homeless encampments. This move could involve activating the D.C. National Guard, which the president can command without local approval, and potentially challenging the city's Home Rule Act. Critics and local officials contest the administration's premise, pointing to official data showing a significant drop in violent crime in the city. The proposal is seen by some experts as a way for the administration to exert federal power over a heavily Democratic jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has noted a significant increase in the activity of Chinese research ships in the American Arctic, a trend observed over the past three years. In response, the Coast Guard is enhancing its own presence to monitor these vessels. Recently, two Chinese research ships were identified operating in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, with five others being tracked in or near the polar region. This heightened activity from China, including from its Polar Research Institute, is prompting a more robust U.S. operational posture to assert sovereignty and monitor foreign actions in the strategic region.</p>

All 43 annual events, including marquee fights and "Fight Nights," will be available to subscribers without additional fees. The deal, which also gives Paramount a negotiating window for international rights, underscores the high value of live sports content for streaming platforms seeking to attract and retain subscribers.</p>

Israel claimed responsibility, alleging al-Sharif was a Hamas leader, a charge the network denies and press freedom groups have questioned. The incident highlights the extreme dangers faced by Palestinian journalists covering the conflict, as they are the primary source of on-the-ground information with international media access heavily restricted. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports at least 186 media workers have been killed during the war, calling it the deadliest conflict for journalists in modern times.</p>

          <p>Ten years after China's surprise devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, its exchange-rate management has significantly matured. Analysts note that Beijing has moved away from depleting its massive foreign reserves to defend the currency, a tactic that cost nearly a trillion dollars between 2014 and 2017. Instead, China now employs a more diverse toolkit to manage volatility, allowing for a more market-based, yet still controlled, pricing mechanism. This evolution has helped stabilize its foreign reserves and paved the way for the yuan's inclusion in the IMF's reserve currency basket. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to money psychology expert Morgan Housel, many intelligent investors mistakenly complicate their strategies, which often leads to poorer long-term results. He, along with figures like Warren Buffett, advocates for a simple, consistent approach, such as periodically investing in low-cost index funds like those tracking the S&P 500. This passive strategy allows investors to achieve average market returns over an extended period, which historically outperforms the majority of active fund managers. The core principle is that sustainable, long-term growth is more valuable than chasing high-risk, short-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tween accessories retailer Claire's has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in seven years and has started liquidating its stores. The company, once a mall staple, struggled to adapt to the decline of brick-and-mortar retail and recent macroeconomic pressures like higher interest rates and tariffs. Despite turnaround efforts that included partnerships with Walmart and a new loyalty program, the brand failed to overcome its financial obstacles. The company is currently negotiating with potential buyers, but its future remains uncertain, following a trend of repeat retail bankruptcies that often end in liquidation.</p>

          <p>In his book "The Right of the People," author Osita Nwanevu argues that achieving true democracy in the United States requires a fundamental overhaul of both its political and economic structures. He contends that the country has never been a genuine democracy and that its foundational institutions were designed to protect elite interests. Nwanevu proposes a progressive agenda, including ending the Senate filibuster, expanding the House, and implementing wealth taxes to break up monopolies. The book review in the article critiques this vision as politically naive, suggesting it overlooks the complexities of right-wing populism and the actual sentiments of many American voters.</p>

          <p>Air India has announced the suspension of its direct flight service between New Delhi and Washington, D.C., effective September 1. The airline attributes this decision to an aircraft shortage resulting from planned upgrades to its aging Boeing fleet. Additional operational complexities, such as longer flight routes due to the continued closure of Pakistan's airspace, have also contributed to the cancellation. Passengers will be offered alternative routes to Washington with layovers in other U.S. cities through Air India's partner airlines, including United and Delta.</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace engineers have developed a new 'stealth' launcher designed to deploy nets for capturing space debris without creating light, smoke, or significant vibrations. The device uses a closed-gas, energy-absorbing mechanism to ensure a precise and gentle launch, preventing any jolt to its satellite platform. This technology aims to address the growing problem of orbital debris, which poses a threat to active satellites and space missions. However, the development also raises questions about its potential dual-use capability as a space-based weapon, given its stealthy and precise nature.</p>

          <p>Citing a surge in dog bite incidents, India's Supreme Court has ordered the removal of 5,000 stray dogs from the streets of New Delhi. Authorities have been instructed to capture, sterilize, and relocate the dogs to shelters within eight weeks, focusing on 'high-risk areas'. The order comes as the capital reports nearly 2,000 dog bites daily and India accounts for over a third of global rabies deaths. Conservationists have criticized the decision as impractical and unscientific, questioning the availability of adequate shelters and advocating for mass vaccination and sterilization programs instead of removal.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries, including Canada, India, and Australia, to the scheme. This 'deport now, appeal later' policy allows the government to remove foreign nationals who have committed crimes, with the individuals participating in their appeal hearings via video link from their home countries. The government argues the measure will prevent exploitation of the immigration system, ease prison overcrowding, and save taxpayer money. The move is part of a broader plan to immediately deport foreign offenders after they receive a custodial sentence.</p>

          <p>Workers in India's vital jewelry and textile industries are expressing growing anxiety over the Trump administration's additional tariffs on Indian exports. The levies, which could reach 50%, were imposed due to India's continued purchases of Russian oil. In major hubs like Surat and Tiruppur, workers fear that the tariffs will devastate sectors that are heavily reliant on the U.S. market, leading to job losses and reduced hours. Industry leaders warn that the increased costs could bring sectors like diamond polishing to a standstill, placing immense pressure on the entire supply chain.</p>

          <p>Former White House officials warn that the U.S. is dangerously unprepared for future biological threats following the dismantling of key biosecurity offices under the Trump administration. The National Security Council’s biosecurity directorate and the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy are now effectively defunct, leaving no dedicated leadership to coordinate a response to outbreaks like Ebola or a future pandemic. The authors, who previously managed successful responses to Ebola outbreaks, argue that without these specialized units and experienced staff, the nation has lost its early-warning and containment capabilities, making it more vulnerable to deadly diseases.</p>
