          <p>Texas Democrats, attempting to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, have left the state to deny a legislative quorum and traveled to Illinois for support. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin have joined them, condemning the Texas GOP's effort to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats. Democrats argue the move disenfranchises minority voters and is an abuse of power, while the Texas governor has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested. This standoff highlights the intense national battle over redistricting and its impact on future elections.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump claims that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, alleging political discrimination against conservatives. He stated that he was forced to move hundreds of millions of dollars to smaller banks after being denied accounts by the financial giants. The allegations come as the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to penalize banks for denying services based on political grounds. JPMorgan denied closing accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>New York City socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing scrutiny after speaking at a church led by a pastor known for radical views, including advocating for reparations and the abolition of police. The pastor, who has also expressed anti-Israel sentiments, referred to Mamdani as his "brother and friend." This appearance has drawn attention to Mamdani's own past rhetoric, such as his previous calls to defund the police, which he recently attributed to frustration over George Floyd's death in an apparent effort to moderate his stance.</p>

          <p>Japan has set two new national heat records in a single day, with temperatures soaring past 107°F (41.8°C) in the city of Isesaki. This extreme heat is part of a broader trend that made last summer the hottest on record and is impacting the country's agriculture, water supply, and natural landmarks. Experts warn that the changing climate is causing earlier cherry blossoms and a delayed snowcap on Mount Fuji, highlighting the severe and tangible effects of global warming on the nation's environment and culture.</p>

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation has revealed the operations of a violent Iraqi-Kurdish gang smuggling people across the English Channel from France to the UK. Posing as a migrant, a reporter gained access to the gang's forest hideout and documented their methods, including collecting cash payments at a major UK railway station. The report details the gang's hierarchical structure, its use of violence against migrants, and its ability to evade law enforcement, underscoring the significant challenges authorities face in dismantling these lucrative criminal enterprises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a lawsuit alleging sexual assault and harassment by former San Diego Wave employees, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has denied all claims and argued it has "no duty of care" to the club's staff. The league's legal filing contends that any alleged incidents were between the individuals and the club, not the league itself. The NWSL's defense also invokes the "doctrine of consent" and claims some allegations are beyond the statute of limitations, a legal strategy experts describe as a boilerplate attempt to cover all possible defenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been launched against FIFA, arguing that its transfer regulations have unlawfully suppressed player income for over two decades and breached EU laws on free movement. The case, initiated by the Justice for Players foundation, could impact 100,000 footballers and potentially lead to billions in damages. Advised by the lawyer from the landmark 1995 Bosman ruling, the litigation could prove transformational, possibly enabling players to terminate their contracts without their clubs receiving compensation, which would fundamentally alter the global football industry.</p>

          <p>Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, has announced that the country's next general election will be held in February 2026. This vote will mark the first election since a widespread popular uprising led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government one year ago. In his address, Yunus confirmed that his caretaker government would fulfill its duty to oversee the transition and would step down following the election, paving the way for a new, democratically elected government to take power.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has entered the U.S.-India trade dispute, asserting that India is a sovereign country with the right to choose its own trade partners. This statement follows President Trump's threat to impose substantially higher tariffs on India for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil, which he argues fuels the war in Ukraine. Russia's press secretary condemned the U.S. threats as illegitimate and an attempt to force countries to sever trade relations with Moscow, highlighting the growing geopolitical tensions surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire, burning in California's Los Padres National Forest, has rapidly grown to over 72,000 acres and remains only 7% contained.

          <p>According to Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to propose a full military reoccupation of the Gaza Strip to his security cabinet. This potential move, which would involve conquering the entire territory to defeat Hamas, comes as ceasefire talks have collapsed. The plan is reportedly opposed by some top military officials and is deeply concerning to the families of Israeli hostages, who fear for their loved ones' safety. Such an escalation would likely draw widespread international condemnation and worsen the already severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

The report details a "toxic" safety culture, a flawed design process, and a failure to address known damage to the vessel's hull. Investigators stated that the company's co-founder, Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, ignored warnings and created an environment where safety concerns were dismissed in favor of operational continuity.</p>
