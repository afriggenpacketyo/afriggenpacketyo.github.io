          <h2>UK Retail Sales Surge Due to Favorable Weather Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 03:21:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a boost in March, driven by sunny weather that increased demand for clothing and DIY products. The Office for National Statistics reported a 0.4% rise in sales volumes, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Garden centers saw robust trading, while non-food stores also benefited from the improved weather. However, food sales, particularly at supermarkets, declined, and analysts cautioned that consumer confidence might be waning despite the recent positive trend. The increase last month means that across the January to March quarter, sales volumes were up 1.6% compared with the previous quarter, which the ONS said was the biggest increase for nearly four years.</p>

          <p>With a record number of foreign nationals residing in Japan, associations are urging greater recognition of their contributions and a more proactive immigration policy. At a recent event in Tokyo, panelists highlighted the perception of foreigners primarily as a source of labor and called for forums where their voices can be heard. Concerns were raised about the lack of relevant parties involved in policy making related to immigration and foreign residents. The government's 2022 Roadmap aims to facilitate integration, but lacks a clear vision on the number of foreign residents needed or whether to encourage Japan as a destination.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between Iran and the United States regarding Tehran's nuclear program are set to resume in Oman, focusing on technical details. The talks aim to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for easing economic sanctions, against a backdrop of escalating tensions and threats of military action. Iran seeks support from China and Russia, while the US excludes European allies from direct negotiations. Complicating matters are concerns over restricted IAEA inspections and potential Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, adding further uncertainty to the already complex situation.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams oversaw the destruction of over 3,500 seized illegal firearms, emphasizing the city's commitment to reducing gun violence. The weapons were fed into a gun chipper and recycled, with the scrap metal being donated to a technical school for use in a memorial honoring victims of gun violence. The NYPD has seized over 21,400 firearms since Adams took office, including over 1,400 ghost guns, which are untraceable firearms often acquired by criminals.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council, Sean Stein, suggests that the United States may overestimate its leverage in tariff negotiations with China. Stein notes that China has been preparing for potential tariffs since 2018 and doesn't see the need for a deal as urgently as the White House. He also points out that China is wary of appearing to be bullied on the world stage, which could hinder negotiations. Stein believes the US views its tariff policy narrowly, while China sees it as part of a broader strategy to contain its growth.</p>

          <p>This article examines the human cost of President Trump's hardline immigration policies, highlighting several cases of migrants facing harsh treatment. These cases include a Salvadoran man wrongly accused of gang affiliation and deported, a Turkish PhD student detained for criticizing Israel, and a U.S. citizen wrongfully arrested for illegally entering the country. The article suggests that these actions reflect a broader strategy of cruelty and fear, despite deportations being down overall. The author argues that these policies are causing widespread fear and have created a situation that looks increasingly like the behavior of a police state.</p>

          <p>Barry Hearn is considering moving the World Snooker Championship away from the Crucible Theatre after 2027, its home for almost half a century. The move is being driven by the potential for greater financial opportunities in China and Saudi Arabia, as well as other locations in the UK. Eddie Hearn believes snooker is leaving a huge amount of money on the table by staying faithful to the Crucible. While the preferred option is to keep it in Sheffield, the players ultimately want more money.</p>

          <p>A government survey in Japan reveals that 35% of local government officials have faced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, more than three times higher than in the private sector. This suggests public officials regularly receive unreasonable requests from taxpayers. As "kasu-hara" (customer harassment) gains public attention, more local governments and companies are taking steps to protect workers. The government has submitted a bill requiring companies to establish rules against customer abuse and provide complaint systems for victims, while municipalities will also need to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan migrants subject to removal from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act are given only 12 hours to decide if they want to contest their removal, according to court documents. Lawyers argue this is insufficient time to seek legal counsel and prepare a challenge. The government contends the timeline complies with a Supreme Court decision requiring a "reasonable" time to appeal. The ACLU argues the short period violates the Supreme Court order, noting that suspected Nazis during World War II were given 30 days to challenge their designation in court.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has spent over £600 million to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to replace it over a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu meant the Post Office did not own the code for the core part of the system, preventing them from building a replacement or inspecting the software. Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed. The Post Office prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting based on the faulty system.</p>
