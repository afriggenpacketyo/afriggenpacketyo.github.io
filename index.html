These nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy supplies, fear the move will significantly harm their economies and energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico criticized the plan as building a new Iron Curtain, warning of higher energy prices for consumers. Despite the EU's aim to achieve full energy independence from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, some Eastern European countries remain heavily dependent on Russian energy.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the deceased British novelist, has been digitally reanimated to teach an online writing course with BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about using AI to resurrect the dead. While the Christie family approved the project and insisted on using her own words, some ethicists argue that Christie cannot consent to the course. The use of AI to create her likeness, though not to write the script, blurs the boundaries between fact and fiction.
