          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump convened at the G7 summit in Canada to discuss trade tariffs, but failed to reach a comprehensive agreement. Ishiba emphasized the importance of a mutually beneficial deal that safeguards Japan's automotive industry, while Trump has been pushing for tariffs to address trade imbalances. Despite ongoing ministerial talks, significant differences persist, particularly regarding the 25% tariff on automobiles, a critical sector for the Japanese economy, and the uncertainty of a deal has emerged ahead of Japan's House of Councillors election.

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, with over 140,000 currently unhoused and projections estimating a near tripling by 2030. Factors contributing to this trend include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, and mounting medical issues, especially for the Baby Boomer generation who faced high unemployment and rising housing costs in their early adulthood. This aging homeless population places a significant strain on healthcare systems, leading to high hospitalization rates and difficulties in discharge due to lack of support, and the article highlights the urgent need for government programs like Medicaid to remain intact to prevent further descent into homelessness.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting its focus to the global arms export market to deepen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, driven more by security concerns than profit motives, and this shift aims to develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons imports. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, while also achieving economies of scale in domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump's early departure disrupts G7 organizers' plans to discuss the Middle East conflict and issue a statement calling for de-escalation, and the US has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has incurred nearly $20 million in police costs and other expenses in response to protests over federal immigration raids. The LAPD has spent $16.9 million, including $11.7 million for overtime, and other costs include $780,601 to repair damage at City Hall and other city buildings. Protests have been ongoing since immigration agents raided a fast-fashion warehouse on June 6, leading to 575 arrests, and the additional costs from the protests will strain L.A.â€™s already-shaky finances.</p>

          <p>In response to immigration raids by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have proposed a new state law to ban law enforcement from concealing their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability by requiring officers to wear identification and preventing them from appearing as secret police. Exceptions would be made for SWAT teams and situations where masks are necessary for health reasons, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has criticized the proposal, arguing it poses a threat to law enforcement officers by identifying them and subjecting them to retaliation.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Dodger Stadium, despite being told to sing it in English, to show support for her community amid immigration sweeps. Nezza's performance has sparked conversations about Clotilde Arias, a Peruvian immigrant who wrote the official Spanish translation of the national anthem, "El PendÃ³n Estrellado," in 1945. Arias' work was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to strengthen ties with Latin American countries, and her legacy was largely unknown until her grandson discovered her sheet music in 2006.</p>
