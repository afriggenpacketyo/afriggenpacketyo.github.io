          <p>Longtime Trump administration insider May Davis Mailman has departed her role as deputy assistant to the president, marking a significant staff change in the second term. While she is the highest-ranking official to leave without being forced out, she will temporarily remain a special government employee to conclude her policy work. Sources indicate Mailman plans to start her own government affairs firm, maintaining her connections within Washington's political sphere. Her departure is noted as a loss of a seasoned hand for the administration's inner workings.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Texas Democratic lawmakers has fled the state for Illinois to prevent a vote on a new congressional map that would create five new Republican-leaning districts. By denying Republicans the necessary quorum, they aim to halt what they call a "Trump gerrymander" and a rigged system. This political maneuver, however, exposes the lawmakers to potential daily fines and arrest under a 2023 state law. The move also threatens to derail other legislative priorities, including disaster relief for recent flood victims.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have confirmed the death of Khamis Ayyad, a Palestinian American man in his 40s, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Ayyad died from smoke inhalation after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad. The U.S. State Department condemned the criminal violence and is providing consular assistance to the family. This incident marks the second death of a Palestinian American in the West Bank in three weeks amid a rise in settler attacks and broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees before the August recess. The deal, which involved funds for health programs and international aid, ultimately collapsed when the president rejected the terms. The failed negotiations highlight the deep partisan gridlock, with both sides accusing the other of political extortion and bad-faith tactics. The standoff leaves approximately 140 presidential nominations, including key ambassadorial posts, in limbo until at least September.</p>

          <p>NORAD fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated the temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, retreat. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention before escorting the plane out of the restricted airspace. This was one of five such unauthorized incursions over the weekend, prompting officials to remind general aviation pilots to check all FAA notices before flying. NORAD emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

The union stated its members deserve a contract that secures their families and recognizes their expertise.

The proposed site, the former Royal Mint, would be Europe's largest embassy.

A recent report highlights that women are increasingly choosing the procedure to focus on careers or find the right partner without the pressure of declining fertility. However, the process is expensive, often costing over $12,000 per cycle, and does not guarantee a future pregnancy. Bioethicists caution that it presents a gamble and raises concerns about equitable access and the societal pressures that push women to delay childbirth.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million in its second weekend. However, this represented a steep 66% drop from its impressive debut, a more significant decline than other recent superhero films. The film's global total has reached $369 million. Following behind were the debut of the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" with $22.2 million and the new "The Naked Gun" movie with $17 million, indicating a varied but somewhat slow start to the August box office season.</p>

          <h2>Apple Reportedly Considering Acquisition of AI Search Company Perplexity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 17:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the company's acquisition strategy have fueled speculation that Apple may be looking to acquire Perplexity, a rapidly growing AI search chatbot. Perplexity, valued at around $18 billion, offers a user-focused experience with real-time, direct answers that could align well with Apple's design philosophy. Such a deal would instantly provide Apple with an established AI model and monetization strategy, accelerating its roadmap in the competitive artificial intelligence space. The move would represent a significant departure from Apple's usual strategy of smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to the data revisions as justification, while the president claimed the numbers were "rigged." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue the administration is "shooting the messenger" for politically inconvenient economic news. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a new court filing, Trump administration lawyers have denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. Senior adviser Stephen Miller previously stated the administration was looking to set a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day. However, a Justice Department filing in a California lawsuit states that no such directive has been issued to ICE. The discrepancy highlights the administration's aggressive immigration agenda and raises questions about its internal policies versus its public declarations.</p>
