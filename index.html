          <p>New college graduates are encountering a more challenging job market compared to expectations earlier in the year, as indicated by rising unemployment rates and decreased job postings. Economic uncertainty stemming from policy changes like federal hiring freezes and concerns about job displacement due to artificial intelligence are contributing factors. Experts advise graduates to maintain a positive attitude and consider opportunities at smaller firms, which may offer better growth prospects. A recent study showed that graduates who start at smaller companies are more likely to become founders later in their careers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are currently debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. The debate is emotionally charged, with MPs clashing over the role of doctors, safeguards against coercion, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals. Concerns were raised about people feeling pressured to end their lives and the possibility of medical staff suggesting assisted dying to patients. The bill has undergone scrutiny and revisions, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval, and is expected to face a vote soon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing internal divisions over deals to sell advanced computer chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, raising concerns about potentially outsourcing the future of the AI industry and enabling China. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies and expand their global reach, others worry about inadequate protections preventing the technology from benefiting China and the concentration of data centers in the Middle East. The deals involve billions of dollars and aim to help the Gulf States develop their own AI industries, but critics fear the U.S. may be repeating past mistakes by exporting critical technology.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, ultimately led to the conviction of Jerry Westrom in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially struggled to identify the killer, but forensic advancements in DNA testing and investigative genetic genealogy provided a breakthrough. The unknown DNA profile from the crime scene matched Westrom, who initially denied knowing Childs or being at her apartment. Ultimately, footprint analysis confirmed that Westrom's prints matched those left in Childs' blood, solidifying the case against him.</p>

          <p>Direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators commenced in Istanbul, mediated by a U.S. delegation, marking the first such talks since the start of the war. Expectations for significant breakthroughs remain low, with President Trump suggesting that substantial progress hinges on a meeting between him and Vladimir Putin. The talks follow a period of diplomatic maneuvering, with both sides seeking to demonstrate responsiveness to Washington's call for direct engagement. The negotiations are viewed by some as a strategic effort by Putin to maintain Trump's attention and avoid being perceived as obstructing peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Irregular migration to Germany has decreased significantly over the past two years, according to police figures, with a drop of over 100,000 entries.

It analyzes the misogynistic undertones of labeling Hudson as such, particularly in a cultural moment where traditional gender roles and financial dependence on men are being romanticized. The piece argues that the "gold digger" trope serves as a scapegoat for anxieties surrounding these shifting dynamics, allowing society to avoid confronting the uncomfortable realities of power and economic imbalance in relationships.</p>

Cava's CFO noted that diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual-dining restaurants, a trend observed for several quarters. Despite strong performance, Cava reiterated its conservative same-store sales forecast, projecting slower growth in the latter half of the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

The justices explored potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to constitutional questions or requiring three-judge panels for such rulings.
