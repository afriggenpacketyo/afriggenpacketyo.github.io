          <p>After a trial that spanned nearly eight years, Monica Sementilli was found guilty of first-degree murder for plotting the 2017 killing of her husband, beauty executive Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors successfully argued that Sementilli and her lover, Robert Baker, conspired to commit the murder for financial gain, staging it to look like a burglary. Key evidence included thousands of texts between the lovers, DNA from Baker at the scene, and secretly recorded conversations where Sementilli appeared to incriminate herself. Baker pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life, while Sementilli received the same sentence after a jury convicted her.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have killed at least 50 people, with officials reporting that more than two dozen campers from Camp Mystic in Kerr County remain missing. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, swelling by 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to a massive emergency response involving over 160 air rescues. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a federal disaster declaration to provide state resources, while officials described the chaotic scene of rescuing hundreds of people, some found clinging to trees to survive the deluge.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his pitching prowess with two dominant, scoreless innings, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately fell to the Houston Astros 6-4 due to a struggling bullpen. After Ohtani's impressive 31-pitch outing on his birthday, long reliever Justin Wrobleski gave up five runs, erasing an early Dodgers lead. The loss highlighted the team's current reliance on younger pitchers as they await the return of injured stars Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, whose recoveries are progressing and offer hope for a stronger rotation after the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain observed the changes to the landscape and towns he once knew intimately. The excerpt captures his profound sense of nostalgia and belonging upon returning to a steamboat's pilot house, a place where he felt a unique sense of freedom and reconnected with a cherished, carefree period of his life.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations aimed at standardizing the work of its powerful central commissions and leading groups, which some analysts interpret as a significant political shift. These new rules stipulate that these top-level bodies should focus on major strategic planning, discussion, and oversight.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a scientific explanation for why the Texas Hill Country, known as "Flash Flood Alley," is one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for flash flooding. A combination of steep hills, soils that do not absorb water well, and unique meteorological conditions created by the Balcones Escarpment contribute to the rapid runoff. When heavy downpours occur, this geography causes shallow creeks to quickly transform into raging, deadly torrents, as seen in the recent catastrophic event that claimed dozens of lives.</p>

          <p>The first complete, unobscured images of a large, mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft, also known as an Ekranoplan, have surfaced. The aircraft, spotted on a pier in the Bohai Sea, features a flying-boat hull, a large joined v-tail, and what appear to be powerful engines, though their exact type remains inconclusive. Analysts speculate it could serve various military roles, including logistics, search and rescue, or even anti-submarine warfare, leveraging its ability to fly efficiently and stealthily just above the water's surface.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: How Donald Trump Employs the 'Madman Theory' in Foreign Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores President Donald Trump's strategic use of unpredictability in foreign policy, a tactic political scientists call the "Madman Theory." The approach aims to make adversaries believe he is capable of anything, thereby extracting concessions. The article notes its success in pressuring NATO allies to dramatically increase defense spending but questions its effectiveness against foes like Russia and Iran. Critics worry this doctrine could ultimately damage U.S. credibility and lead allies to seek strategic independence, fundamentally altering global alliances.</p>

          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings product continues to divide opinion, with some users praising its 25% government bonus for helping them buy a first home or save for retirement. However, the product faces significant criticism for its rigid and outdated rules, which have not been updated since its 2017 launch. Key complaints include a harsh penalty that claws back some of the saver's own money on early withdrawals and a £450,000 property price cap that is increasingly unrealistic in high-cost areas like London.

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in the 'Run Against ICE,' a 15-mile demonstration winding through the heart of Los Angeles' immigrant communities to protest recent federal raids. The event was organized to show solidarity with families impacted by deportations and to call for an end to aggressive enforcement tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that have created widespread fear.

          <p>Public health experts are expressing alarm over the Trump administration's decision to slash funding for HIV and AIDS research, warning it could reverse years of progress. While a treatment-focused initiative remains, funding for crucial prevention research, vaccine development, and a potential cure has been gutted. Dr. John Brooks, former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division, fears these cuts will lead to an increase in new infections, undermining the national goal of eliminating the HIV epidemic by 2030 despite recent successes in reducing transmission.</p>

          <p>An executive order from the Trump administration signals a renewed effort to curb the influence of China's powerful drone industry, but analysts say Beijing's market dominance makes this a difficult task. Chinese firms like DJI are world leaders, and a lack of viable non-Chinese alternatives means that any ban could significantly increase costs for the many commercial sectors that rely on their products. Industry insiders view the move as a negotiation tactic but acknowledge the challenge of removing Chinese technology from global supply chains.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing sharp criticism for sending a "misleading" and partisan-sounding email praising President Trump's new spending bill. The email claimed the bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries," which critics and former officials have labeled a "lie." In reality, the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a permanent elimination of taxes. The communication from the typically apolitical agency has been condemned as a blatant political statement.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that pregnant individuals exposed to high heat and wildfire smoke face increased risks of negative birth outcomes. The research, published in Environmental Science & Technology, revealed that exposure, particularly during the first trimester or even before conception, was linked to having smaller babies. The effects were nearly doubled for those living in hotter, more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. Health experts are urging for greater awareness and simple precautions, like staying cool and wearing masks, to protect pregnant people and their developing babies.</p>
