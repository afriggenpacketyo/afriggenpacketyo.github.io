        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal authorities have filed a complaint alleging that scammers impersonated the President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance Inaugural Committee, fraudulently stealing over $250,000 in USDT stablecoin from donors. The perpetrators utilized phony email addresses designed to mimic the official committee, coercing victims into sending cryptocurrency donations. The U.S. government is actively seeking to permanently seize nearly $40,400 USDT to deter criminal activity and recover assets for victim compensation. This case underscores the persistent threat of digital impersonation scams and the challenges of recovering dispersed cryptocurrency, with about half the funds already recovered from a Binance account.</p>

          <p>Joey Chestnut is making his highly anticipated return to the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2025, aiming to reclaim his title after missing last year's event due to a partnership with a rival plant-based food company. He still holds the all-time record of 76 hot dogs and buns, set in 2021, and expressed confidence in "annihilating" defending champion Patrick Bertoletti. In the women's competition, reigning champion Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory, consuming 33 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. This Fourth of July tradition continues to captivate spectators in Coney Island, Brooklyn, as competitors vie for the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt and a $10,000 cash prize.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has achieved a significant career milestone by powering her way into the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time, defeating France's Diane Parry in straight sets. Her impressive run follows a period of overcoming multiple injuries and self-funding her career, propelling her world ranking from outside the top 300 to 51st. The 23-year-old, who previously beat 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko, is now set to face Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Her determined attitude and strong performances are catching the eye, with the potential for her to become the new British number one by the end of the tournament.</p>

          <p>A powerful gas station explosion rocked a neighborhood in southeastern Rome, injuring at least 25 people, including 10 first responders, and causing widespread devastation. The blast, heard across the Italian capital, sent a massive cloud of dark smoke and fire visible from afar. Local police and firefighters had already responded to a gas leak report when two subsequent explosions occurred, prompting swift evacuations of a nearby sports center and buildings, which Mayor Roberto Gualtieri credited with preventing a far more serious tragedy. Rome prosecutors have launched an investigation into the cause, potentially linked to a previous liquefied petroleum gas unloading phase.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing strong criticism from Jewish advocacy groups for using the term "Shylocks" during a recent speech in Iowa, a word that evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jewish people and greed. Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League condemned the term as "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that words from leaders matter. Trump, when questioned, claimed he had "never heard it that way," asserting his understanding of "Shylock" as merely a high-rate money lender. This incident follows past controversies involving the use of the term by public figures, reigniting concerns about the normalization of antisemitic tropes.</p>

          <p>Germany's parliament has approved significant spending increases for infrastructure and national defense, aiming to make the Bundeswehr "ready for war." While the defense industry anticipates a boom, economists, including Tom Krebs from the University of Mannheim, argue that the overall economic stimulus from military spending will be rather moderate. Their study indicates that €1 of defense spending might generate only 50 cents of additional economic activity, a lower return compared to investments in infrastructure, education, or childcare. This article suggests that the planned militarization is a "risky gamble" with low overall economic returns, primarily benefiting arms companies' profit margins.</p>

Webb, who connected with his victim on a mental health forum, used the Telegram app to solicit images of self-harm for his sexual gratification and later urged her to commit suicide during a video call. This landmark prosecution is the first in the UK under Section 184 of the Online Safety Act 2023 for encouraging serious self-harm online.

Male flies will be exposed to radiation to make them sterile, then released to mate with wild females, leading to unfertilized eggs and a reduction in the screwworm population. This proven method, which previously eradicated the fly in the U.S. by 1966, aims to prevent infestations in warm-blooded animals, including humans, who are at risk from open wounds.

Despite this, analysts believe Pop Mart International, the company behind Labubu dolls, will largely remain insulated from intensifying scrutiny as its main consumer demographic is younger adults, not children. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapidly growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, are expected to significantly boost revenue, with projections suggesting international markets will soon account for over half its total sales. The company also faces challenges like scalping and counterfeits as it expands its brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has formally recognized the Taliban's government in Afghanistan, becoming the first country to do so since the group seized power in 2021, a move welcomed by Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry and China. This recognition aims to foster "productive bilateral cooperation" and signals a shift in international engagement with the Taliban. While the Taliban seeks international legitimacy and financial support, critics view this as legitimizing a regime with a deeply troubling human rights record, especially concerning restrictions on women. Geopolitical analysts suggest Russia's interest may extend to Afghanistan's rare earth minerals, potentially opening doors for investments in the region.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade, a figure the White House disputes. The bill includes tax cuts, increased immigration enforcement spending, and cuts to programs like Medicaid, as well as reduced tax credits for electric vehicles, a point of contention for Musk.

          <p>This article posits that the escalation of martial law in Boston, particularly through the Coercive Acts of 1774, was instrumental in transforming American resistance into the full-scale Revolution. The author draws historical parallels, cautioning against military overreach in domestic affairs, citing events like the Boston Massacre as examples where military presence exacerbated tensions. The Declaration of Independence explicitly listed British martial law as a primary cause for the breach with the Crown. The article concludes that deploying an army on civilian streets risks provoking tension, fear, anger, and potentially bloodshed and lasting civil discord.</p>

The idea emerged after a 10-day trip to China by international security affairs specialist Pape, who observed major tech firms. This approach offers a potential avenue for economic rejuvenation in struggling American industrial regions and could simultaneously contribute to stabilizing superpower relations between the U.S. and China, fostering mutual economic benefit.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is seeking clarity from Donald Trump after the U.S. paused a crucial arms shipment, raising significant concerns about the security of Ukraine's military equipment supply. While the U.S. State Department downplayed it as a "one event" situation, experts warn that a prolonged halt would severely challenge Ukraine, especially for difficult-to-replace air defense systems. The pause comes amidst intensified Russian attacks and follows Trump's unproductive call with Putin. This situation underscores Europe's growing recognition that it must increase its own defense production and investment in Ukraine's domestic industry to offset potential U.S. supply cuts.</p>

This call comes after Trump expressed disappointment with a prior conversation with Vladimir Putin, who reportedly showed no willingness to de-escalate.

Although her disappearance was deemed suspicious, insufficient evidence initially prevented charges until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed as Peroni's through DNA testing.
