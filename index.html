          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following US Government Assurances</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant development after sales were halted by U.S. export controls. The company stated it received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. This move follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were hindering American tech leadership and had already damaged Nvidia's market share in China. The decision is seen by analysts as a major positive catalyst for the company's growth in the coming quarters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement. The Commerce Department stated the move is designed to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap imports that have undercut the domestic market. While supporters, particularly in Florida, have praised the decision as a victory for U.S. growers, critics and business groups warn it could lead to higher prices for consumers and harm American industries that rely on imported tomatoes.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administrative stay provides a one-week reprieve while the court considers the case, preventing the immediate revocation of deportation protections and work permits. Advocacy groups described the ruling as a critical but short-lived relief, emphasizing the need for a permanent legislative solution for Afghans who fled their country following the U.S. withdrawal and subsequent Taliban takeover.</p>

          <p>Intense storms have triggered severe flash flooding across the New York City area, causing significant damage and disruption in parts of New York and New Jersey.

Emergency services conducted numerous rescues of drivers stranded in high water as some areas received over six inches of rain, bringing transportation to a standstill for many commuters.</p>

          <p>Daniel Serafini, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2021 shooting death of his father-in-law, Robert Gary Spohr. Prosecutors successfully argued that the home invasion, which also included the attempted murder of his mother-in-law, was financially motivated by a dispute over a ranch. Serafini, who was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992 and played for six teams, now faces a possible sentence of life in prison.</p>

The grueling 135-mile course starts below sea level in Death Valley and climbs over 8,000 feet, with temperatures often exceeding 120°F. Becker finished the race with hours to spare, a triumphant achievement after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time during his attempt in 2022.</p>

Shippers reportedly rushed to import goods, particularly from China, to get ahead of looming tariff deadlines set by the Trump administration. While the numbers represent the busiest June in the port's history, officials stressed that this is a sign of trade policy uncertainty rather than organic economic strength, with many importers facing significantly higher costs.
