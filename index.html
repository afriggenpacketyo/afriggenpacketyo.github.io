          <p>Friedrich Merz, the incoming Chancellor of Germany, has named Johann Wadephul as the new Foreign Minister, succeeding Annalena Bock. Wadephul, a close ally of Merz and a CDU lawmaker since 2009, brings extensive experience in foreign policy and security matters to the role. He is known as a strong supporter of European integration and has been a vocal advocate for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, criticizing Donald Trump's proposed peace deal. Wadephul has already engaged with foreign ministers from key European nations in preparation for his new position.</p>

          <p>Houthi media reports that a U.S. strike in Yemen targeted a migrant detention center in Saada, resulting in at least 35 deaths, though independent verification is pending. The U.S. military has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since mid-March as part of Operation Rough Rider, aimed at curbing their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. CENTCOM reports that over 800 targets have been struck, significantly degrading Houthi capabilities, although the group continues to launch attacks. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians since the start of the conflict between Hamas and Israel.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is advocating for Republicans to immediately remove individuals disrupting town hall events, alleging that these 'troublemakers' are paid infiltrators from the 'Radical Left Democrats'.

          <p>The Jacksonville Jaguars made a historic move by trading up to draft Travis Hunter, a versatile cornerback/receiver, marking the first time since 1997 a team has moved into the top five for a non-quarterback. Conversely, the Atlanta Falcons' draft strategy, particularly their trade to acquire pass-rusher James Pearce Jr., has been criticized as an overreach. The article also highlights the odd situation involving the Falcons' defensive coordinator's son, who prank-called quarterback Shedeur Sanders, and discusses the potential impact of the draft on quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Caleb Williams, as well as the draft success of Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>Marriage registrations in China have continued to fall in the first quarter of 2025, prompting local governments to offer incentives, including cash rewards up to 40,000 yuan, to encourage young couples to marry. The number of marriage registrations decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year, while divorce registrations increased by 10%. To address this trend, China has streamlined marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency, though the impact of this reform may be limited.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that increased infrastructure spending in Germany will not be sufficient to counteract the negative impact of U.S. tariffs on the euro zone's economic growth. The IMF recently lowered its growth forecasts for the euro area due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Despite Germany's infrastructure spending bill, trade tensions are expected to weigh heavily on the economic outlook for Europe.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the Han conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112 BC may have contributed to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress, now a critically endangered species. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to link the Han dynasty's riverine warfare tactics to changes in the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples showed a decline in swamp cypress pollen and a spike in charcoal deposits around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on the Nanyue capital.</p>
