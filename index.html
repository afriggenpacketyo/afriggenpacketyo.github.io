          <p>The United States government has reversed its export restrictions on semiconductor design software for China, according to announcements from major software firms Synopsys and Cadence. This move lifts a ban imposed in May that required companies to obtain licenses before exporting certain goods to China. The decision is seen as part of a broader trade truce, with other providers like Siemens EDA also reportedly cleared to resume business. The easing of these curbs is a significant development in the ongoing tech and trade relationship between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans faced a significant challenge in advancing President Trump's major domestic policy legislation, struggling to gather enough votes for a key procedural step. The bill, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin, includes major spending on border security and defense, extends tax cuts, and reduces funding for health and nutrition programs. Both moderate Republicans and conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus have expressed opposition to changes made in the Senate version.

          <p>Armenia is looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate bilateral ties to a strategic partnership, according to its foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan. This diplomatic effort is part of Armenia's broader strategy to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The shift follows Armenia's dissatisfaction with Moscow's role during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent decision to withdraw from the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation.

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering and sex trafficking. However, he was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. The verdict followed a high-profile trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion.

          <p>Amid a tight vote on a major spending bill, questions have arisen about the procedure for a tie in the U.S. House of Representatives. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or motion results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is lost. This rule underscores the high stakes in the closely divided chamber, where even a few defections can derail legislation, as seen in a rare 215-215 tie vote in February 2024.</p>

Bacon argued that voting against the bill would effectively mean a 20% tax increase for all Americans, including a significant financial hit for middle-class families in his state. While moderates worry about millions losing insurance and conservatives fret over the national debt, Bacon defended the Medicaid changes as focused on promoting work requirements for able-bodied adults.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that barred migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor federal law grants the power to unilaterally suspend the right to apply for asylum. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an "invasion." The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is burning out of control in eastern Crete, Greece, forcing the evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist areas. The blaze, fanned by strong winds near Ierapetra, has a fire front extending over 6 kilometers, destroying properties and causing power outages. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by rugged terrain, dense smoke, and hazardous conditions, with authorities ordering a tactical withdrawal to protect personnel. Additional firefighting units are being dispatched as crews work to create firebreaks around threatened settlements.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, demanding his immediate resignation in a social media post. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly criticized him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. The call for resignation came after Powell suggested that the Fed would have already cut rates if not for the economic impact of Trump's tariff policies. This escalation raises questions about presidential influence over the independent central bank, as board members can typically only be removed "for cause."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK watchdog has found that historical child grooming investigations in Greater Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The inspectorate's report noted that some documents had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value. The delays particularly affected two major operations investigating child sexual exploitation and abuse from the early 2000s. The council stated that complex data-sharing rules necessitated the redactions to avoid jeopardizing prosecutions, and a more efficient information-sharing process has since been established.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy can increase breast cancer risk in menopausal women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that using estrogen alone, which is prescribed for women without a uterus, actually reduces the risk. This study refines understanding from previous research, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors. Experts advise that while hormone therapy is effective for menopausal symptoms, individuals should discuss personalized risks and benefits with their doctor.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former PhD criminology student, has admitted to murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022. He pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty, and will now face life in prison without parole. The brutal stabbings of Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogen in their off-campus home shocked the nation. The plea deal has divided the victims' families, with some supporting the closure it brings while others expressed anger at the state for not pursuing a trial.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have revealed key evidence that led to the arrest of Bryan Kohberger for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. A crucial breakthrough came from a Q-tip retrieved from his parents' garbage, which provided a familial DNA match to a sample found on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Investigators also noted his car had been "meticulously cleaned" and "essentially disassembled inside" to remove evidence. These details, shared at Kohberger's plea hearing, offer new insight into the investigation, though his motive for the killings remains unknown.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals a significant shift among Latino voters, with 48% voting for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, a substantial increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this trend reflects a growing populist sentiment rather than a conservative ideological shift. Analysts point to disillusionment with the Democratic Party's economic messaging and immigration policies as key drivers. This evolving dynamic challenges long-held assumptions about the Latino electorate and signals a critical moment for both political parties to re-evaluate their outreach to this crucial demographic.</p>
