          <p>A devastating shooting unfolded at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, where an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old were killed, and 17 others, including 14 children, sustained injuries during a morning Mass. The perpetrator, 23-year-old Robin Westman, who legally acquired the firearms, died by self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities, including the FBI, are probing the incident as a deliberate act of violence and a potential hate crime, investigating a disturbing video manifesto linked to the shooter. The tragedy has elicited widespread sorrow and calls for meaningful change from city, state, and former national leaders, underscoring the community's profound shock and grief.</p>

The company projects over 50% sales growth for the current quarter, despite U.S. restrictions on H20 chip shipments to China impacting potential sales. Net income increased significantly, with data center sales for GPU chips and networking parts driving the growth, benefiting from large cloud providers' investments in AI.

          <p>U.S. universities, including the University at Buffalo and Arizona State, are reporting a significant drop in international student enrollment for the fall semester, with an estimated 15% overall decline nationwide. This downturn is largely attributed to the Trump Administration's stricter visa policies, leading to long delays and increased scrutiny, particularly affecting graduate programs in STEM fields. The Association of International Educators warns that this trend could result in a loss of $7 billion in economic spending and over 60,000 jobs, alongside a decrease in innovation and cultural diversity on campuses. While President Trump has recently expressed support for international students, his administration's actions have created considerable uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Federal agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration successfully executed a major narcotics bust in Franklin, New Hampshire, leading to the arrest of 27 individuals. The operation seized significant quantities of fentanyl and methamphetamine, with investigators directly linking the drugs to Mexico’s powerful Sinaloa Cartel, tracing the supply through Lawrence, Massachusetts. This concerted effort targeted the criminal networks responsible for exacerbating the nation’s fentanyl crisis, which accounts for over 70,000 overdose fatalities annually. Authorities emphasize the ongoing nature of the investigation to further dismantle these illicit drug operations.</p>

          <p>With a nearly 90% likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, savers holding Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts are advised to make strategic moves to maximize earnings. A rate cut would reduce future CD interest rates, impacting savers who have benefited from a higher-rate environment. Experts recommend shopping online for the highest rates, precisely determining an affordable deposit amount to avoid early withdrawal penalties, and opting for the longest-term CD that fits one's budget to secure current rates and protect principal. These proactive steps can help savers navigate the changing economic landscape effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit filed against the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans and its top officials accuses Archbishop Gregory Aymond of personally covering up child sexual assault by priests and deacons. The suit, brought by bond trustee Argent Institutional Trust Co., alleges that Aymond and vicar general Pat Williams concealed the extent of abuse before investors purchased $41 million in church bond debt in 2017. It cites media reports revealing a discrepancy between the number of accused clergy and those publicly disclosed by Aymond, and seeks to deny retirement benefits to the accused officials before bondholders are paid. The archdiocese has dismissed the allegations as baseless.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and assert control over the central bank has sparked a debate among liberals regarding the Fed's independence. While many see Trump's actions as an assault on democratic institutions, some progressives argue that the Fed's political independence is itself anti-democratic, advocating for more democratic control over monetary policy. The article explores the justifications for Fed independence, such as insulating decisions from short-term political pressures to ensure price stability, and argues that Trump's actions are anti-democratic procedurally and substantively, potentially subordinating long-term public interests to his short-term political goals.</p>

Google asserts Fox is demanding excessive payments, while Fox criticizes Google for exploiting its influence. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr urged a resolution, highlighting the importance of access to news and sports. If an agreement isn't reached, YouTube TV plans to offer a $10 credit to affected subscribers.</p>

          <p>Southern California prosecutors believe 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro likely died from abuse inflicted by his parents, Jake and Rebecca Haro, before they falsely reported him missing. The parents were arrested and charged with murder after inconsistencies emerged in the mother's account of an alleged abduction. Authorities, who have yet to find the baby's remains despite cooperation from the father, revealed that Jake Haro had previously pleaded guilty in 2023 to abusing another child, who suffered permanent injuries. The district attorney criticized the judge's decision to allow work release instead of prison time in the earlier abuse case.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey announced he will boycott the state banquet for Donald Trump's upcoming visit to the UK, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Sir Ed stated that while declining a royal invitation goes against his instincts, he aims to send a message to Trump, whom he believes has the power to influence an end to the starvation and secure hostage releases in Gaza. This decision follows similar boycotts during Trump's 2019 visit and has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who called it "pathetic gesture politics." The boycott highlights ongoing international pressure on leaders regarding the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old man, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, was arrested in Dallas for allegedly making bomb threats outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Wilkinson reportedly approached security officers, displaying a "detonator" on his wrist and claiming to have a bomb in his backpack, prompting a shelter-in-place order. The Dallas Police Department, with a bomb squad, arrested him on charges of false reporting to induce an emergency response. This incident is part of a broader trend of increased assaults and threats against ICE officials, who have seen a 1,000% rise in such incidents since the beginning of the Trump administration, impacting agent training and preparedness.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's accusation that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook committed mortgage fraud by claiming multiple primary residences, experts highlight the inherent difficulty in proving such allegations. Owner-occupancy mortgage fraud typically involves misrepresenting residency to secure lower interest rates and tax benefits. While Cook's attorney plans a lawsuit to challenge her removal, legal experts emphasize that proving intent to deceive, rather than mere error, is crucial in court. The article notes that this type of fraud is "difficult to detect" and prosecute, contrasting legal challenges with public opinion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that President Trump's militarization of domestic policing, exemplified by deploying soldiers in combat gear in Washington D.C., represents an "opening salvo" in a shift towards a "prerogative state." The article suggests Trump uses "crime fighting" as a ruse to intimidate, present himself as a law-and-order protector, and consolidate power, drawing parallels to historical authoritarian regimes. Concerns are raised about the creation of "specialized units" of the National Guard for public order issues and the potential for deploying troops at polling places, stretching legal boundaries like the Posse Comitatus Act. The piece warns that manipulating law can make legality and illegality indistinguishable, threatening democratic order.</p>

          <p>The NFL has relaxed certain restrictions on Tom Brady as he embarks on his second year as a Fox analyst, following his approved 10% ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. Initially, Brady was prohibited from attending production meetings with coaches and players, but this restriction has been lifted, allowing him to participate remotely. He remains barred from team facilities for these meetings but can conduct off-site player interviews. The league also maintains a rule against "egregiously criticizing officials," which Brady adhered to in 2024. These adjustments streamline Brady's ability to fulfill both his broadcasting and ownership responsibilities.</p>

          <p>For 2025, the maximum Social Security payment for a retiree at full retirement age is $4,018 per month, increasing to $5,108 for those who delay claiming until age 70. Achieving this maximum requires exceptional lifetime earnings at or above the taxable maximum for at least 35 years. Given that most retirees receive significantly less and rely heavily on Social Security, additional income streams are crucial. Options like reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, while annuities can provide guaranteed retirement income.
