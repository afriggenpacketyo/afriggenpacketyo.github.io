          <p>British energy giant BP reported second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. In response to the strong performance, the company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend and will continue its share buyback program. The positive results are bolstered by the announcement of the Bumerangue discovery off the coast of Brazil, its largest oil and gas find in 25 years. These developments aim to restore investor confidence following a period of underperformance relative to industry peers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's foreign ministry has pushed back against threats of increased tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump over its oil trade with Russia. New Delhi stated it only began significant Russian oil imports after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe, a move it claims the U.S. initially encouraged to stabilize global energy markets. The ministry highlighted that both the U.S. and the EU continue their own trade with Russia in various sectors.

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling that partially limited President Trump's asylum ban, U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop related deportations. The court order stated the ban cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. According to Department of Homeland Security officials, Customs and Border Protection was told to revert to processing migrants under existing U.S. immigration law. The original ban, which was challenged by the ACLU, had been blocked by a lower court last month.</p>

          <p>The Gifford fire in central California's Los Padres National Forest has grown to over 72,000 acres, threatening more than 450 structures and prompting evacuations in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The blaze, which is only 5% contained, has injured at least three people, including a motorist and two contract workers. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in extremely difficult terrain, with hot, dry weather and gusty winds expected to fuel further growth. The cause of the fire, which started from several smaller blazes, is under investigation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the "Russiagate" probe was a politically motivated effort to undermine his presidency. The order comes after the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified report accusing the Obama administration of politicizing intelligence. It is currently unclear what specific charges might be considered or who could be targeted by the investigation.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional map. The lawmakers' absence denied the House the necessary quorum to conduct business, stalling the legislative session. In response, the Republican House Speaker issued warrants for their arrest to compel their return to the Capitol. This dramatic escalation follows the Democrats' protest against the redistricting plan, which they argue is designed to unfairly benefit the Republican party in future elections.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could lead to significant costs for taxpayers. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's firefighters and save an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have dropped by over 20% since 1985 while emergency calls have tripled. If the trend continues, more towns may be forced to switch to paid fire departments, a costly transition. Some lawmakers are proposing incentives like student loan forgiveness to help recruit and retain more young volunteers.</p>
