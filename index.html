          <p>Police in Harris County, Texas, are actively searching for Tory Dugas, a 36-year-old man who was mistakenly released from jail. Dugas was scheduled to begin a seven-year prison sentence for assault and evading arrest but was let go due to a clerical error that failed to properly document his sentence. The sheriff's office has launched a thorough investigation into the "erroneous release," which marks the second such incident at the facility this year. Authorities are now asking for public assistance in locating the fugitive to return him to custody.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to eliminate mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted. Citing unsubstantiated claims of corruption and fraud, he argued that states must comply with federal directives on election administration. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress, not the president. Legal experts and election officials have noted that mail-in voting has been a secure and established practice in the U.S. for decades, including during the Civil War.</p>

          <p>Arab mediators are waiting for Israel's formal response after Hamas announced its acceptance of a new ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by Qatar and Egypt. The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce, during which about half of the remaining hostages would be freed while negotiations for a permanent ceasefire continue. Israel has recently stated it would only accept a comprehensive deal for the release of all hostages and has not yet officially commented on the new proposal. Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet is expected to approve a military plan to occupy Gaza City, raising fears for the safety of remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of Americans, at least 60%, use dietary supplements, yet the industry remains loosely regulated, operating in what critics call a "Wild West." According to health columnist Anahad O’Conner, supplement manufacturers can make vague health claims without undergoing clinical trials to prove safety or effectiveness. The FDA has limited oversight unless severe side effects are reported. While some supplements like creatine may offer modest benefits when combined with resistance training, many others, such as collagen, lack convincing scientific support, and experts advise obtaining nutrients primarily from a healthy diet.</p>

The National Hurricane Center has warned of these hazardous conditions for much of the week, prompting evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding. Tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect for the Bahamas and parts of North Carolina. Officials are urging the public to heed local warnings and avoid entering the ocean as the powerful storm churns in the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flight operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its flight attendants, ending a strike that began on Saturday. The dispute, which grounded hundreds of flights and affected thousands of travelers, centered on issues of pay and scheduling, particularly for time spent on the ground.

          <p>Democratic Representative Sarah McBride of Delaware, a transgender woman, has accused President Trump of launching an "all-out assault" on American democracy. Her criticism follows the president's announcement that he is preparing an executive order to ban mail-in voting and voting machines, a move he claims will restore honesty to elections. McBride asserted that a president with popular policies would not need to resort to such measures. The statement reflects the intense political division over election integrity, with the White House defending the president's actions as necessary to protect the vote from what it calls reckless Democratic policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government announced that the United Kingdom has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "back door" into its encrypted services, marking a significant victory for the tech giant and privacy advocates. The dispute centered on end-to-end encryption, which secures user data in a way that even the service provider cannot access it. UK officials had sought access for criminal investigations, but tech companies and cybersecurity experts argued that any such backdoor would undermine user privacy and create vulnerabilities for malicious actors. This development could have broad implications for the global debate on encryption and government surveillance.</p>

Despite the suspension and police reports, his disciplinary case remains unresolved, and he was later able to secure a job at an Iowa hospital.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to end a key provision of the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan is causing financial distress for millions of student loan borrowers. By resuming interest charges for those in the plan, the administration has effectively dismantled the program, forcing many to switch to more expensive repayment plans or face accruing debt. Borrowers who spoke with the Guardian described feeling overwhelmed, with some seeing their monthly payments double and having to delay major life plans like starting a family. Critics argue the move punishes those already in debt while the administration provides tax cuts to the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The traditional model of college athletics is facing a seismic shift as revenue-generating athletes in sports like football and basketball are now eligible for direct payment from their schools. This change, a result of recent court rulings, is prompting fears that non-revenue sports such as squash, rowing, and diving will be cut to free up athletic department budgets. In response, President Trump signed an executive order aiming to preserve these programs. However, critics argue that subsidizing non-revenue sports, which often cater to wealthier students, at the expense of fairly compensating the athletes who generate billions in revenue is an inequitable system.</p>

Unlike other European leagues often dominated by one or two teams, the EPL's relative balance ensures that most matches are unpredictable.

          <p>A recent study suggests that doctors may quickly become dependent on artificial intelligence for routine diagnostic tasks, potentially dulling their own skills. The research, conducted with gastroenterologists in Poland, found that after using an AI-assisted system for colonoscopies, doctors were about 20% less effective at spotting abnormalities on their own. The findings, published in The Lancet, indicate that clinicians might subconsciously wait for AI prompts rather than relying on their own expertise. While some experts are skeptical that skills could degrade so quickly, the study highlights the need for more research into how AI is changing medical practice.</p>

This financial growth has made teams in leagues like England's Premier League highly valuable assets, with American investors now holding stakes in a majority of its clubs.

          <p>New consumer research indicates that people are spending less at fast-food and casual restaurants this summer, with customer traffic dropping by 6% compared to last year. This decline is attributed to persistently high grocery prices, which are influencing broader spending habits. Instead of dining out, many shoppers are opting for smaller, more affordable treats from the supermarket, often choosing branded products over cheaper store-brand alternatives. While overall grocery inflation has slightly decreased, consumers continue to seek savings on everyday essentials, making dining out one of the first expenses to be cut from their budgets.</p>

          <p>The animated film 'Nobody,' from Shanghai Animation Film Studio, has become the highest-grossing 2D animated movie in Chinese box office history, earning over 1 billion yuan. The film has surpassed previous record-holders from Japan, such as 'Suzume' and 'The Boy and the Heron,' marking a significant success for domestic animation. Based on a popular online series, 'Nobody' is distinguished by its unique aesthetic, which incorporates traditional ink-wash painting techniques to create a distinct Chinese visual style. Its success signals a potential shift in audience preferences, which have long been dominated by Japanese anime.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting at the White House, European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, expressed that the talks with President Trump were a success. Zelenskyy called the meeting a "significant step toward ending the war," while Merz stated his expectations were "exceeded." The discussions focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. Despite the positive tone, doubts linger regarding the specifics of Trump's commitments and the feasibility of arranging a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein is reportedly considering moving its headquarters back to China from Singapore as it seeks approval from Beijing for a planned initial public offering in Hong Kong. The company, which was founded in China but has been based in Singapore since 2021, has faced significant regulatory hurdles in its attempts to list publicly in London and the United States. A move back to China could be a strategic effort to align with Chinese authorities, although it may complicate its image in Western markets where it already faces scrutiny.

          <p>Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capitol, ending a two-week walkout that had halted legislative business by denying Republicans a quorum. Their return allows the GOP-led effort to redraw the state's congressional maps to move forward, a plan that could create up to five new Republican-leaning seats for the 2026 midterm elections. The Democrats' protest was a response to President Trump's call for the mid-decade redistricting. In a countermove, Democrats in California are now advancing their own redistricting plan, setting the stage for a contentious, nationwide battle over congressional maps.</p>

          <p>State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat from Fort Worth, reported being locked inside the Texas Capitol upon her return from the recent Democratic walkout. Collier stated that she was being confined because she refused to accept a mandatory escort from the Department of Public Safety, a condition placed on returning Democrats. She described the situation as an infringement on her right to challenge governmental decisions. The incident adds another layer of tension to the highly partisan fight over a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional maps, a battle Democrats have vowed to continue in court.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced plans to deploy 4.5 million militia members across the country in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. The move follows the Trump administration's decision to double the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and to launch anti-drug operations in the Caribbean. Maduro characterized the deployment as a measure to defend Venezuela's territory and sovereignty. The announcement escalates the already high tensions between the two nations, with Washington not recognizing Maduro's presidency.</p>

          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, authorities are increasingly turning to nature-based solutions like wetland restoration to manage the dual climate threats of intense flooding and severe drought. Urban sprawl and aging sewer systems have left cities like Mechelen vulnerable to extreme rainfall. By "depoldering" land and giving rivers more space, officials are creating natural buffers that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during dry periods. While these projects initially faced resistance, they are now seen as vital climate adaptation strategies, improving both safety and local biodiversity.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has convicted 38-year-old Donald Jamesbrown Henry of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing his friend, Shawn Popp, during a 2022 argument. The dispute reportedly began over differing views on former President Donald Trump's business history. Henry claimed self-defense, but investigators found insufficient evidence to support his claim that he needed to use deadly force. He now faces a sentence ranging from over 16 years to life in prison for the killing, which highlights the severe real-world consequences of political polarization in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to shut down the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) program, a highly successful mission that has been monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide for over a decade. The plan involves not just decommissioning the satellites but actively destroying them by forcing a reentry into the atmosphere, a move scientists say will hamstring climate research for years. This action is part of a broader push by the administration to cut funding for NASA's Earth science division, which critics argue wastes billions in taxpayer investment and leaves the nation less prepared for natural disasters and the impacts of climate change.</p>

The letter calls the demand "misguided and punitive," arguing that it weaponizes the issue of antisemitism to attack higher education. Signatories assert that freezing hundreds of millions in research funds will harm the entire community, including Jewish students and faculty, without making the campus safer.
