          <p>The initial wave of Chinese goods facing tariffs exceeding 145% has arrived at U.S. ports, impacting companies like Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, and Ralph Lauren. These tariffs, implemented by President Trump, have caused confusion and uncertainty among businesses, leading to altered planning and frozen decisions. While some companies continue importing essential goods despite tariff concerns, the overall volume of freight vessels from China has significantly decreased. Trump suggested a potential reduction to 80%, but the effects of such high tariffs on consumer demand and the economy remain a concern.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to implement new rules from the 2026-27 season that will require teams to have at least eight players meeting specific criteria, such as being Japanese-born, on the pitch simultaneously. This initiative aims to give domestic players more opportunities and exposure in the league. The current rules have three player categories, with each team needing at least 11 Category A players eligible for the Japanese national team on the field. The planned changes will divide Category A players into 'A1' (Japanese players) and 'A2' (foreign players), potentially stirring controversy.</p>

          <p>David Souter, a retired Supreme Court Justice, passed away at 85 in New Hampshire. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with liberal justices, disappointing conservatives. His retirement in 2009 allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, marking a significant shift in the court's ideological balance. Souter was known for his preference for solitude and intellectual pursuits over Washington's social scene, and his unexpected alignment with liberal viewpoints shaped his legacy on the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A recent study by leading climate scientists indicates that the severe storms in the central Mississippi Valley in early April were made more intense and likely due to the burning of fossil fuels. Record rainfall caused catastrophic flooding, resulting in fatalities and widespread damage across several states. The study found that human-caused climate change increased rainfall intensity by approximately 9% and likelihood by 40%, with warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico playing a significant role.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to fall back to Earth after failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction. Experts estimate the half-ton spacecraft could reenter the atmosphere soon, potentially landing anywhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the risk of impact on humans is low, there is concern that the spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, might not fully burn up during reentry, posing a threat to aircraft and populated areas.</p>

The website will target misinformation on issues such as the Los Angeles fires, crime, climate, and the economy.
