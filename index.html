          <p>A violent incident at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, has left four people dead and several others injured. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, reportedly drove his vehicle into the church, opened fire with an assault rifle, and started a fire before being killed by police. The FBI is investigating the event as an act of targeted violence, with the motive still under investigation as authorities search the suspect's property. The attack occurred during a Sunday service with about 100 people present.</p>

          <p>In a series of social media posts, former President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the United States. He also stated he would place "substantial Tariffs" on any country that does not manufacture furniture within the U.S. Trump claimed these measures are necessary to protect and revive California's film industry and North Carolina's furniture business, which he says have been "stolen" by other countries. This echoes a similar threat made previously regarding foreign films, which did not result in action.</p>

          <p>Iranian authorities have executed a man named Bahman Choobiasl, accusing him of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. This execution is part of what human rights activists describe as a significant increase in the use of the death penalty in Iran, with over 1,000 executions reported in 2025. The UN has criticized the sheer scale of the hangings, describing them as an "industrial scale" violation of human rights. The event occurs as Iran faces reimposed international sanctions over its nuclear program, which are further straining its economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has increased the deportation of Southeast Asian refugees, many of whom arrived in the U.S. as children and have old criminal convictions. Advocacy groups report that these forced removals, often of individuals who have since reformed and established families, are creating a "ripple effect" of trauma and financial hardship for their communities. Many of these refugees, including Hmong and Laotian nationals, are being sent to countries they have never lived in, facing statelessness and economic despair. This policy is seen by critics as a betrayal of the U.S.'s duty to refugees who fled after American-involved conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the early Premier League season suggests that all major title contenders, including Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea, are showing significant flaws. Liverpool's defense appears vulnerable despite a strong start, while Arsenal is still struggling with self-belief even after securing late wins. Manchester City is in a developmental phase, adjusting to new players and tactics, and Chelsea seems mired in self-doubt and defensive shakiness.

          <p>Albertsons Companies has issued a recall for several store-made deli products due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recall affects various pasta salads and dishes sold in Albertsons-owned stores across more than a dozen states, including Safeway, Vons, and Randalls. The contamination risk stems from a recalled bowtie pasta ingredient supplied by Nate's Fine Foods. While no illnesses have been reported, consumers are advised to discard the products or return them for a refund, as listeria can cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>In Moldova's recent parliamentary election, the ruling pro-European Action and Solidarity (PAS) party won a clear majority with over 50% of the vote, a result that defied pre-election polls. This outcome is being interpreted as a significant rejection of Russian influence and a strong endorsement of the country's path toward the European Union. The pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc received a much lower-than-expected 24% of the vote. The victory for PAS reinforces President Maia Sandu's pro-Western agenda and is seen as a major political setback for the Kremlin, which had reportedly invested heavily in a pro-Russian campaign.</p>

          <p>Housing market experts suggest that the fall season presents a mixed bag of opportunities and challenges for prospective homebuyers. Potential advantages include less competition from other buyers and the possibility of lenders offering year-end incentives to meet quotas. However, the downsides include potentially lower housing inventory compared to the peak spring and summer seasons, and the risk of missing out on potentially lower mortgage rates if the Federal Reserve continues its rate cuts. Buyers are advised to weigh these factors carefully, as waiting could also mean facing increased competition in a future market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional college paths.

Many in Gen Z perceive trades as more secure from automation and are attracted to the potential for entrepreneurship and independence.

The policy, which reverses a 2015 decision to abolish the grants, will be funded by a new levy on international student fees.

This move reinstates a full embargo, blocking international banking, strangling oil exports, and restricting trade, which is expected to severely impact the Iranian economy and the daily lives of its citizens. The return of these crippling sanctions narrows the path for diplomacy and places Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, designating it a potential threat to international peace.</p>

The practice of shutting down non-essential services stems from legal opinions in the early 1980s.

          <p>"Bernd das Brot," a perpetually gloomy loaf of bread character from German children's television, has unexpectedly gone viral in the United States. The character, known for his world-weary attitude and dry humor, was recently featured on John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight," where he was described as "the most German thing I've ever seen." For 25 years, Bernd has been a cult figure in Germany, offering a stark, depressive contrast to typical cheerful children's programming. His newfound American audience is now celebrating the unique, anti-fun appeal of the character who just wants to be left alone.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold hitting a new record high of $3,800 per ounce, investors who bought at lower prices may be considering selling to realize profits. Experts advise a strategic approach, starting with an evaluation of whether it is the right time to sell, as some analysts believe prices could rise further. The process depends on the type of gold owned; selling physical gold like coins or bars may be best done with a local, reputable dealer, while gold ETFs or stocks can be sold through a brokerage. Investors should also research current prices to ensure a fair deal and consult a professional about potential tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has provided new details on the Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1), a shipborne laser weapon that was unveiled at a recent military parade in Beijing. According to the article, the LY-1 is designed to serve as a "last line of defence" for naval vessels, intercepting close-range threats like missiles and drones. The journal claims the weapon's output and overall structure, including a lens aperture nearly twice the size, are superior to comparable American systems like the Helios laser. This development highlights China's advancements in directed-energy weapons as part of its ongoing military modernization efforts.</p>

She emphasized the need to maintain a restrictive monetary policy to bring inflation down, even as the Fed faces pressure on both sides of its mandate, suggesting a tricky path ahead for interest rate decisions.

          <p>New evidence raises questions about Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer's claim that he was "personally defrauded" by the company Aspiration, which is central to a salary cap circumvention scandal involving Kawhi Leonard's 2019 signing. It has been revealed that Ballmer's investment group made a significant grant to a different foundation run by Aspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg in December 2024. This donation occurred months after the federal government had already begun investigating Aspiration. The continued financial support for Sanberg's ventures appears to contradict Ballmer's public statements about being a victim of fraud in the affair.</p>

          <p>A 21-point plan proposed by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza has been revealed, outlining a pathway to a Palestinian state and a comprehensive roadmap for the region's future. Key elements include the immediate release of all remaining hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the removal of Hamas from power, and reform of the Palestinian Authority. The plan, developed with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and reportedly aided by the Tony Blair Institute, also calls for an Israeli commitment not to occupy or annex Gaza.

          <p>The U.S. electric vehicle market is poised to reveal its "natural demand" as the long-standing federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases expires. While EV sales hit a record high in the third quarter, driven by a rush of buyers ahead of the deadline, industry executives from companies like General Motors and Hyundai expect a significant drop-off in the coming months. The end of these incentives, which have been crucial for boosting consumer adoption, will test whether the EV market can sustain its growth based on its own merits.

Despite progress in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the assessment warns that the EU is unlikely to meet its 2030 nature restoration targets.
