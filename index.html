        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his executive order to halt federal funding for the non-profit broadcaster. The lawsuit alleges that Trump's order infringes upon First Amendment protections for speech and the press, and oversteps the authority of Congress. NPR and other public radio stations argue that the order threatens the public radio system, which provides essential news and information to millions of Americans. The news outlets' attorneys contend that the order is designed to punish and control news coverage deemed biased by the administration.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage outlined his party's proposals to alleviate financial pressures on families, including tax breaks for married couples and the removal of the two-child benefit limit. Farage emphasized that lifting the benefit cap is intended to support lower-paid workers, not to encourage a benefits culture. He also pledged to reverse government cuts to the winter fuel payment for 10 million pensioners. Labour Party chairwoman Ellie Reeves criticized Farage's proposals as unrealistic, likening them to the economic policies of Liz Truss. </p>

          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the initial sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing costs by excluding intermediary profits. The first sale rule has gained traction during President Trump's administrations as tariffs increased. To apply the rule, businesses must ensure multiple sales occur between independent parties, prove the item's destination is the U.S., and document the first sale price. </p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are warning against a proposal by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). They argue that dismantling this watchdog, created after those scandals, would increase the risk of corporate disasters. The PCAOB was established to independently oversee public company audits and restore trust in financial reporting, bringing rigorous inspections and enhanced enforcement. The authors contend that independence from the SEC is vital for the board's focused mission of ensuring high-quality audits, especially for overseas companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may be painting an overly optimistic picture of the economy. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, includes not only unemployed workers, but also those seeking full-time employment and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. The report argues that the official unemployment rate is flawed because it counts people as employed even if they have worked as little as one hour in the prior two weeks. The LISEP report highlights that millions of Americans are struggling to afford basic needs and are therefore functionally unemployed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and House Republicans are working to restrict federal benefits for families that include immigrants without permanent legal status. These efforts include barring certain immigrants from accessing Medicaid and Medicare, limiting access to the child tax credit, and cutting off federal financial aid. Experts and advocates argue that these changes would primarily affect U.S. citizen children with noncitizen parents, and authorized immigrants like refugees. Critics argue that such policies could undermine the well-being of children and families, while proponents claim they prevent undocumented immigrants from benefiting from taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increasing competition. Despite an overall rise in battery electric car sales in Europe, Tesla sold only 7,261 cars, while facing protests at dealerships due to Musk's association with Donald Trump. The company's aging car lineup and growing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players have contributed to the sales decline. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain in a matter of weeks, which was eventually diagnosed as pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens. After contracting COVID-19, Mauceri developed swelling in his legs and abdomen, leading to fatigue and shortness of breath. Doctors initially struggled to identify the cause, but cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction and performed open-heart surgery to remove the thickened pericardium. Following the surgery, Mauceri recovered and returned to conducting, feeling healthier than he had in years.</p>

          <p>Former Congolese President Joseph Kabila has reemerged in a rebel-held area, criticizing the government of President Felix Tshisekedi. Kabila's presence in Goma, controlled by the M23 rebel alliance, has raised concerns about jeopardizing mediation efforts. Some analysts argue that sidelining Kabila is counterproductive, while others view him as a shadow power the government is trying to contain. Kabila's public criticism of Tshisekedi's leadership has intensified the conflict between the two, leading to accusations of corruption and undermining democracy.</p>
