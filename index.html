          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 12:43:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic legislators, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced a bill aimed at preventing illegal price gouging by large corporations. The proposed legislation would grant more power to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to litigate abuses, and it would require companies with over $100 million in revenue to publicly report significant price changes. This move comes in response to rising inflation and concerns that companies are using President Trump's tariff policies as a pretext to excessively raise prices for consumers. The bill seeks to provide more transparency and accountability for corporate pricing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has terminated Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor known for her work on the high-profile cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Sean "Diddy" Combs. No official reason was provided for her dismissal from the Southern District of New York. In a message to former colleagues, Comey, who is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, warned against fear suppressing independent thought. Her firing occurs amid a broader pattern of dismissals within the DOJ under the Trump administration, raising concerns about political interference in the justice system.</p>

HCTZ is prohibited as it can be used as a masking agent for other performance-enhancing drugs.

Starmer asserted that MPs were elected on a Labour manifesto and must support the government's mission to enact change.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent rollback of green-energy subsidies in the "Big Beautiful Bill" was a positive but insufficient step. The author contends that such subsidies distort the tax code, misallocate capital, and foster cronyism rather than genuine innovation and energy abundance. The piece refutes the common counterargument about fossil-fuel subsidies, claiming they are comparatively smaller and often consist of neutral tax treatments available to multiple industries. The author concludes that while cutting any subsidy is politically difficult, this partial rollback proves that fighting for a less distorted market can be successful.</p>

          <p>This article scrutinizes President Trump's recent claims that the European Union does not purchase American cars or agricultural products, which were made amid a tense trade dispute. An analysis of 2024 trade data shows these claims are inaccurate. While the U.S. does import more from the EU in these categories, the EU was the fourth-largest market for U.S. agricultural goods and imported approximately 165,000 American-made vehicles. The piece provides context on tariffs and regulations that influence the trade balance between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a leading producer of high fructose corn syrup, fell after President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola had agreed to use "REAL Cane Sugar" in its U.S. beverages. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost thousands of American jobs and increase foreign imports. Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating it would share details on "new innovative offerings" soon, leaving the market to react to the president's influential but unconfirmed declaration about the iconic brand.

His comments, which align with Trump's public pressure on the Fed, suggest a potential dramatic shift away from the institution's traditional independence and operating principles if he were to be appointed.

          <p>A new in-depth report from NHS England has exposed significant inequalities in hospital waiting lists for non-urgent treatment. The data shows that working-age people, women, and those from the most deprived communities are more likely to experience longer waits for care. Gynaecology services have the largest backlog for patients under 65, and women make up 57% of the total waiting list. Health officials intend to use these findings to help hospitals identify and address these "unfair waits" and reduce health disparities across the country.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced a bill to officially classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow state and local governments to request federal funding from FEMA to respond to and prepare for deadly heat waves. Proponents argue the move is critical as extreme heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, and current policy does not explicitly list it as a qualifying disaster. The legislation aims to unlock resources for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and other heat adaptation projects.</p>
