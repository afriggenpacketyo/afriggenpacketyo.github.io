          <h2>Trump's Proposed Legislation Introduces New Caps on Federal Student Loans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major legislative package from President Donald Trump includes significant changes to the federal student loan system, notably by imposing new lifetime borrowing limits. Effective July 1, 2026, for new borrowers, the bill establishes a total lifetime cap of $257,500 for all federal student loans and eliminates the Grad PLUS loan program entirely. The legislation also sets specific annual and lifetime limits for graduate, professional, and parent PLUS loans, which experts believe will reshape how higher education is financed. Critics argue this could shift borrowing towards private loans, potentially disadvantaging low-income students, while proponents suggest it may curb rising tuition costs.</p>

          <p>Bank of America is preparing to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts closely monitoring key financial metrics. Projections from LSEG and StreetAccount anticipate earnings of 86 cents per share on revenue of $26.72 billion. The bank is expected to have benefited from an increase in net interest income and robust trading revenues, potentially signaling a positive trend for the latter half of the year. While the company previously guided for a decline in investment banking fees, strong performance from competitors like JPMorgan Chase suggests a possibility for an upside surprise.

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender colleague. The disciplinary action followed an incident where Peggie expressed discomfort, leading to her suspension and a subsequent employment tribunal case she filed against the health board. This case unfolds amid intense debate in Scotland over gender identity and a recent UK Supreme Court ruling clarifying the definition of "sex" under the Equality Act. NHS Fife stated it is committed to an inclusive environment while reviewing its policies based on the new legal guidance.</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blackstone is significantly increasing its investment in the U.S. rental housing market, acquiring brands like Tricon Residential and AIR Communities. The company's strategy focuses on markets with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states, and includes apartments, student housing, and single-family homes. Blackstone states it owns less than 1% of the nation's rental homes, but its real estate income trust (BREIT) holds an interest in nearly 275,000 units. Analysts suggest that with construction costs high, buying existing properties is a strategic move that could support rent growth and benefit the firm in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A church deacon in Wayne, Michigan, is being praised as a hero for preventing a mass shooting by ramming a rifle-wielding attacker with his pickup truck. Richard Pryor saw the armed man advancing on the CrossPointe Community Church and decided to intervene, striking the shooter despite his truck being hit by gunfire. This action gave the church's armed security team time to respond and fatally shoot the assailant, who had already wounded one person. Over 100 congregants, including children, were inside at the time, and officials credit Pryor's quick thinking with preventing a far greater tragedy.</p>

This event was the sixth-highest hourly rainfall total in the city's history, with such extreme storms now occurring far more often than in the past. Experts warn that the city's aging infrastructure was not designed for this new climate reality, and significant investment is needed to protect against worsening freshwater and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the traditional American system of governmental checks and balances is collapsing, particularly as the executive branch under President Trump usurps legislative powers. The author contends that the Supreme Court has enabled this power grab, and the Republican-controlled Congress has failed to provide a meaningful check, prioritizing party unity over constitutional principles. This erosion of separated powers is destroying internal checks within the executive branch, such as the firing of inspectors general. The author suggests that public opinion remains the last potential check against this concentration of power, though its effectiveness in a fragmented media landscape is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The UK's inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in the year to June, its highest point since January 2024. According to the Office for National Statistics, the increase was driven by higher prices for food, clothing, and transportation, including air and rail fares. This figure surpasses economists' predictions and remains well above the Bank of England's 2% target, complicating decisions on interest rates. Despite the rising inflation, which puts pressure on household budgets, many analysts still anticipate the Bank will cut borrowing costs at its next meeting to stimulate the recently shrinking economy.

          <p>Fauja Singh, the British Indian athlete celebrated as the world's oldest marathon runner, has died at the age of 114 after being struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run. The incident occurred in his native village in Punjab, India. Known as the 'Turbaned Tornado,' Singh gained international fame in 2011 when, at 100 years old, he became the first centenarian to complete a full marathon. He had taken up running at age 89 to cope with grief and went on to inspire millions. Indian police are investigating the accident that led to the tragic death of the beloved athlete.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement officials have seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency connected to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel as part of a nationwide operation targeting drug trafficking. The announcement from the Justice Department on Tuesday detailed that the crypto seizure was part of broader raids since January that also netted 44 million fentanyl pills and thousands of pounds of fentanyl powder and methamphetamine. This financial blow to the cartel comes shortly after Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of kingpin 'El Chapo,' pleaded guilty to drug charges in a U.S. court, signaling continued pressure on the powerful criminal organization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern Water has implemented a temporary hosepipe ban for nearly one million customers across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, effective Monday. The restriction is a response to prolonged dry weather that has left the River Test and River Itchen, key water sources, at critically low levels. The ban prohibits using a hosepipe for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violations. The move has drawn criticism from the GMB trade union, which highlighted the company's high rate of daily water loss due to leaks from aging infrastructure.</p>

Furthermore, a rebound in investment banking activities like mergers and debt issuance, as seen with rivals, is also projected to contribute positively. The recovery in stock prices is also expected to bolster the firm's asset and wealth management division, setting the stage for potentially outsized returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of French automaker Renault fell by as much as 17% after the company lowered its 2025 financial guidance and announced a change in leadership.

The market reacted negatively to the profit warning, sending the stock to a 52-week low.

The three nations, all part of the BRICS alliance, are major trade partners for Moscow, particularly in energy.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced the deportation of five convicted migrants to Eswatini, a small, landlocked monarchy in Southern Africa. This action follows a recent Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport migrants to third countries that are not their own. The deportees, from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, and Yemen, were convicted of serious crimes, including sexual assault of a child and murder, and their home countries had reportedly refused to accept them back.

          <p>President Trump has signaled a significant shift in his approach to the war in Ukraine, threatening Russia with severe tariffs while also promising billions in weapons for Kyiv, to be funded by European allies.

However, key details about the weapons and the feasibility of the tariff threat remain vague.
