          <p>Director Emerald Fennell, known for "Saltburn," has shared her vision for the upcoming film adaptation of Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights," starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. Speaking in Haworth, Brontë's hometown, Fennell described her intent to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced reading the novel as a teenager. She acknowledged taking some creative liberties to fill in what she imagined as a 14-year-old, while still preserving much of the original dialogue. The film aims to be a deeply personal and visceral interpretation of the classic, scheduled for a Valentine's Day 2026 release.</p>

          <p>Michele Beckwith, the former acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, alleges she was terminated after instructing a Border Patrol chief to comply with a court injunction. Beckwith states she warned Chief Gregory Bovino that a federal court order prohibited indiscriminate immigration raids in her district without probable cause. Shortly after sending an email emphasizing "compliance with court orders and the Constitution," her access was revoked and she was fired after a 15-year career. Two days later, agents conducted a raid in Sacramento, an action Beckwith had advised against.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old California man, Varun Suresh, has been charged with murder for allegedly targeting and killing a 71-year-old registered sex offender. Authorities report that Suresh used the Megan's Law website to find the victim, David Brimmer, and posed as a door-to-door CPA to lure him out of his home. The attack was described as a violent struggle that continued into a neighbor's residence, where Brimmer succumbed to stab wounds. Suresh allegedly told police the act was premeditated and that he felt no remorse, leading to charges of murder and burglary with special allegations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its freeze on more than $4 billion in foreign aid previously approved by Congress. In its emergency order, the court's conservative majority stated that the administration's asserted harms in conducting foreign affairs outweighed the potential harm to aid recipients. The three liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers and Congress's "power of the purse."

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei and AI startup DeepSeek are spearheading China's efforts to reduce its reliance on U.S. semiconductor technology, particularly from Nvidia. DeepSeek, developer of a world-class AI model, is shifting to support domestically produced chips, while Huawei has unveiled its latest Ascend chip series as a direct competitor to Nvidia's processors. This move comes as Beijing encourages its tech firms to stop purchasing Nvidia chips designed to comply with U.S. export controls. These developments highlight how American trade restrictions have inadvertently spurred significant innovation within China's domestic AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely alleged Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. However, the court deferred a ruling on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a necessary finding for Smartmatic to collect damages, which its attorneys state could be in the "nine-figure" range. Lindell has vowed to continue his fight against voting machines.</p>

          <p>India's intensified "ruthless" containment strategy against its long-running Maoist insurgency is raising concerns about its human cost, particularly for tribal communities in states like Chhattisgarh. While the government reports a significant increase in anti-Maoist operations and rebels killed, rights activists highlight that civilians are often caught in the crossfire. Families of victims allege that innocent people are being killed by both rebels and security forces, who sometimes blur the line between insurgents and ordinary citizens. The conflict persists in some of India's poorest regions, with locals bearing the heaviest burden of the nearly six-decade-long war.</p>

Stewart was the team's only major acquisition at the trade deadline, brought in to stabilize a struggling relief corps. Despite a recent rehab stint, residual soreness led to the decision for a debridement procedure, which is expected to allow him to pitch for most of the next season. His absence leaves a critical hole in the Dodgers' right-handed relief options as they head into the postseason, increasing pressure on other pitchers.</p>

U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala questioned the newly appointed interim U.S. Attorney, a former Trump lawyer, about why she was presented with two inconsistent indictment documents. The confusion arose because the grand jury voted not to approve one of the three counts presented, leading to a redrafted two-count version. The judge's surprise highlights the unusual nature of the proceedings surrounding the politically charged indictment of the former FBI director.</p>

          <p>During a recent Philadelphia Phillies game, nine-year-old Jameson Pennings caught a coveted foul ball but chose to give it away in a heartwarming act of kindness. After securing the ball, Jameson overheard another fan hoping to get one for her mother, Donna Morey, who was celebrating her 80th birthday at the game. Realizing an older fan was less likely to be tossed a ball, Jameson walked over and gave his to her, stating she couldn't come to as many games as he could. Morey was shocked by the gesture, calling it a symbol of "goodness in this world."</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning the 1937 disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart. The enduring mystery has captivated the public for nearly 90 years, spawning numerous theories about her fate. The move follows a request from a Republican lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands, who cited "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being seen on the island of Saipan. While it is unclear what, if any, classified documents exist, the order aims to bring transparency to one of history's most famous unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>Southern California has experienced a dramatic display of at least 2,000 lightning strikes over the past two days, primarily occurring over the Pacific Ocean. The electrical storm is attributed to a slow-moving low-pressure system that has trapped moisture off the coast. This weather event precedes a forecast for potential thunderstorms and showers in the region over the weekend, particularly on Saturday afternoon. While most areas are expected to receive only light rainfall, there is a possibility of heavier downpours over recent burn scars, according to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice, which he denies. The charges stem from his 2020 Senate testimony where he was questioned about authorizing an FBI official to leak information to the media regarding an investigation into Hillary Clinton. The indictment was championed by President Trump, who has long targeted Comey, and comes just days after the prosecutor on the case was replaced by a former Trump personal lawyer. If convicted, Comey could face up to five years in prison.</p>

The boycott began after Kimmel made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the broadcasters deemed insensitive.

In his emotional return, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the tragic event and clarified his remarks.</p>

Key performances from Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood helped stifle the American team and quiet the home crowd.

          <p>Money manager Howard Rubin, 70, has been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking, with prosecutors alleging a decade-long scheme of abuse. Rubin and his former assistant are accused of transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts, some of which occurred in a Manhattan penthouse converted into a so-called "sex dungeon." A judge ordered Rubin detained without bail after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and had discussed hiring a hitman to target women who previously filed a civil suit against him. If convicted, Rubin faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts believe that President Trump's persistent public attacks on James Comey could provide the former FBI director's defense team with a strong basis to seek a dismissal of his indictment. The defense is expected to argue for selective or vindictive prosecution, citing Trump's years of animosity and recent calls for Comey's indictment. The case's credibility is further questioned by the abrupt replacement of the lead prosecutor with a former Trump lawyer and reports that career prosecutors initially opposed bringing charges. These factors create an unusual and potentially fragile legal foundation for the government's case.</p>
