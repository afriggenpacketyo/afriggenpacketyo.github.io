          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 16:45:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts and former government officials anticipate that the upcoming meeting between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland will primarily focus on establishing frameworks and boundaries rather than securing a definitive trade deal. The meeting, involving Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, occurs after significant tariff increases by both countries. Experts suggest that each side has distinct objectives, with the US aiming to alleviate market pressure and China seeking tariff concessions. The article indicates that while discussions will occur, a breakthrough is unlikely in the immediate future, marking only the 'beginning of the beginning' of negotiations.</p>

          <p>Affirm's shares experienced a significant drop after the financial technology company released a disappointing forecast, prompting investors to question CEO Max Levchin's strategy of prioritizing 0% loans. The buy now, pay later lender projected revenue below analyst estimates, raising concerns about profitability. Levchin defends the approach as a customer acquisition strategy to build long-term loyalty, even if it means sacrificing margins in the short term. Currently, 0% loans constitute 13% of Affirm's Gross Merchandise Volume, primarily benefiting prime and super-prime customers, as Affirm aims to take market share from credit cards.</p>

This order, sent to leadership, is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion content from federal agencies. Military leaders must identify and sequester materials potentially incompatible with the core mission by May 21, using terms like "affirmative action," "anti-racism," and "gender identity" as guidance. This action follows similar orders at institutions like the Naval Academy, which recently removed hundreds of books on related topics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained by ICE agents and held in Louisiana. Her lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel, protected by the First Amendment. The judge emphasized the lack of evidence of a threat to American foreign policy and allowed her to return home to Somerville, Massachusetts.</p>

          <p>A resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, has been scheduled for next week in Los Angeles. The hearing follows months of legal battles and offers the brothers a new chance at freedom. While defense attorneys withdrew their motion to remove current LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, the judge rejected Hochman's attempt to withdraw the resentencing petition. The former DA had requested their sentences be reduced due to modern understandings of trauma and abuse, but Hochman opposes the resentencing.</p>

          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order to discourage criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses, aiming to reduce the burden on small businesses. The order will require agencies to publicly list regulatory violations that could lead to criminal charges and provide guidance on prosecution. Prosecutors will be discouraged from filing charges not on the lists or those that don't require proof of criminal intent. The order will not apply to immigration or national security, but seeks to ease compliance burdens for small businesses.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco appeared poised to temporarily block President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. The judge, Susan Illston, indicated that the administration's planned mass layoffs and restructuring efforts, without Congressional authorization, may violate the Constitution. Plaintiffs, including labor unions and local governments, are seeking a temporary restraining order to pause the administration's plans. The government argues that Trump has 'inherent authority' to control those executing the nation's laws, but the judge seemed unpersuaded.</p>

Trump expressed openness to the tax hike to support lower and middle-income workers, while acknowledging Republican opposition.

          <p>Combining Social Security benefits with annuity payments can create a stable retirement income stream, but careful planning is essential to maximize benefits. One strategy is to delay claiming Social Security until age 70 to increase monthly payments. Another approach involves laddering annuities for flexibility and hedging against inflation. Managing annuity income withdrawals to stay below taxable income thresholds can also reduce the taxation of Social Security benefits. Consulting a retirement income specialist is recommended to develop a personalized strategy.</p>

          <p>With home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) becoming a popular financing option, homeowners need effective payoff strategies. One approach is to take advantage of the interest-only payment period by making larger payments, especially when interest rates are lower.
