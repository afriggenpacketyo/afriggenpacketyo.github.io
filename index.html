            <p>President Trump is facing legal challenges regarding executive actions, including an order targeting a former administration official. A judge has denied a motion to enforce an order on AP access, citing the presumption of good faith for White House officials. The administration is also dealing with the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant wrongfully deported from Maryland. Top Cabinet officials are in Paris for discussions with European counterparts on resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, a pressing international concern. (not investment advice)</p>
