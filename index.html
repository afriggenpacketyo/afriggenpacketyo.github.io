One auto executive drew parallels to China's struggling property sector and Evergrande, warning of a similar crisis in the automotive industry. A government-backed industry group has also criticized BYD's price cuts, while BYD defends its practices as fair competition. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysis of satellite images from 2009 to 2024 suggests a 22% decline in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, and Bellingshausen Sea regions, which house a third of the global emperor penguin population. The primary driver of these losses is climate change, which is thinning and destabilizing the ice used by the penguins for breeding. Researchers emphasize the need for further analysis and immediate action to reduce planet-heating emissions to protect the species.</p>
