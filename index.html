          <p>An exhibition in Shanghai is showcasing early editions of Edgar Snow's influential book, "Red Star Over China," to commemorate the anniversary of World War II. The display features the original 1937 English version, the first U.S. edition from 1938, and the initial Chinese translation. Snow's work provided the Western world with its first detailed account of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, including interviews with Mao Zedong, based on his time embedded with the Red Army in Shaanxi province. The exhibition offers a rare glimpse into the historical context of the period and the book's significant impact.</p>

          <p>In a significant college football upset, Tarleton State, a Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) team, defeated Army 30-27 in double overtime. The victory was secured by a 37-yard field goal from kicker Brad Larson, marking only the second time the program has beaten a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) opponent. Army, last year's American Athletic Conference champion, was hampered by a late-game injury to their starting quarterback, Dewayne Coleman. The win represents a major milestone for the Tarleton State football program and an unexpected start to the season for Army.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, survivors in New Orleans share their stories of loss, resilience, and hope. The article recounts the experiences of a mother who found a new beginning after losing everything, a surgeon who worked tirelessly to save patients in a powerless hospital, and the former police chief who confronted the city's collapse. Their personal narratives provide a powerful look back at the catastrophic event, which caused nearly 1,400 deaths and displaced over a million people. The reflections highlight the long-term human impact and the enduring spirit of those who rebuilt their lives.</p>

          <h2>Author Virginia Sole-Smith Discusses the Pitfalls of Modern Diet Culture for Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, author Virginia Sole-Smith addresses the growing anxiety surrounding children's diets and the influence of diet culture. She argues that the real issue is not specific foods but the restrictive and often misinformed messages that create unhealthy relationships with eating. Sole-Smith criticizes movements like "Make American Healthy Again" for stoking fear and advocates for focusing on food access and body autonomy rather than pathologizing body size. The conversation emphasizes that fostering joyful connections with food and trusting children's internal cues are more beneficial than imposing rigid dietary rules.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, deploying 45 missiles and 537 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. While most projectiles were intercepted, strikes occurred in seven locations, with the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region being hit particularly hard, resulting in at least one death and 29 injuries, including children. The attack damaged dozens of homes and critical infrastructure, leaving thousands without power.

          <p>Newcastle United has finalized the signing of German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for a club-record fee of up to £69 million. The 23-year-old has agreed to a six-year contract, with the deal surpassing the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer. Woltemade, who scored 17 goals for Stuttgart last season and was the top scorer at the Under-21 Euros, is seen as a key addition to Newcastle's attack. Head coach Eddie Howe praised the striker's technical ability and potential for further development under his guidance at the club.</p>

A party spokesperson attributed the issues to inexperience in its early years, stating that the AfD now has stricter internal controls.

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented economic policies that represent a significant departure from the Republican party's traditional free-market, small-government stance. Recent actions include the government taking a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, securing a "golden share" in U.S. Steel, and directly intervening in corporate decisions at companies like Nvidia and Cracker Barrel. This approach, where the president exerts direct influence over corporate America, has been labeled by some critics as a step toward socialism, while others describe it as an ideology-free exercise of power. These policies challenge the long-held conservative principle of minimal government intervention in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A couple has shared the horrifying experience of discovering their stillborn daughter's body on a sofa at the home of their funeral director, Amie Upton. Cody and Liam Townend had entrusted Upton with their daughter's care but found her being kept at Upton's private residence instead of a proper funeral facility. The parents stated their child was "robbed of her dignity," and the case has highlighted the lack of regulation in the UK's funeral industry. West Yorkshire Police investigated but found no crimes had been committed, prompting calls from the family and their MP for new legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's authority to unilaterally implement tariffs has been challenged by a significant legal ruling. On August 29th, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower panel's decision that the president cannot single-handedly alter the country's tariff schedules without congressional approval. This judgment deals a blow to one of the administration's signature economic policies, which has been a cornerstone of its trade strategy. The ruling sets the stage for a potential showdown at the Supreme Court, which will likely have the final say on the president's executive power in matters of international trade.

          <p>A global movement to enhance online child safety is driving the development of new AI-powered technologies. Spurred by regulations like the UK's Online Safety Act and the proposed Kids Online Safety Act in the U.S., tech companies are facing increased pressure to protect minors from harmful content. This has created a new market for age-verification and content-filtering solutions, such as AI that estimates age from facial features and smartphones with built-in safety filters. While these tools aim to make the internet safer, they also raise significant concerns about user privacy and data security.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which he claimed undermines peace efforts. The move, which was welcomed by Israel, is highly unusual as the U.S. is generally obligated to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The Palestinian Authority condemned the ban as a violation of international law.</p>

          <p>After a difficult contract stalemate with the Dallas Cowboys, superstar pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded to the Green Bay Packers. The Packers sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas in exchange for Parsons, who they then signed to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed relief and excitement about the move, stating he went through the "hardest four months" of his life during the negotiations. His arrival provides Green Bay with an elite defensive talent they have lacked for years.</p>

          <h2>Tactical Analysis Reveals Why Manchester United is Struggling Under New Manager</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 02:10:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent struggles, including a cup loss to a lower-league team, stem from systemic issues with manager Ruben Amorim's tactical approach. The analysis explains that Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which relies on creating numerical overloads, is often neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. The team's pre-planned passing routines, such as the 'up-back-through' pattern, become predictable and less effective against disciplined defenses. Defensively, the team's two-man midfield is frequently outnumbered, allowing opponents to control the game once they bypass the initial press.</p>

          <p>Despite heavy international sanctions, North Korea has become a major importer of Chinese wine, with purchase volumes more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. According to Chinese customs data, North Korea is now the second-largest buyer of Chinese bottled wine by volume. Unlike many nations, China does not restrict wine sales to its neighbor, and alcohol is not on the UN's list of banned luxury goods for the isolated country. This trade highlights a key economic lifeline for Pyongyang and its reliance on Beijing for consumer goods.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations that allow men under the age of 22 to leave the country, amending a wartime rule that had banned most men aged 18 to 60 from exiting. The government stated the policy change is intended to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, with the hope they will use their experience to aid in the country's future development. However, the move has sparked debate, with some experts fearing it could exacerbate brain drain and population decline, while others believe it will have a minimal demographic impact.</p>
