          <p>Huawei is reportedly set to announce new technology aimed at reducing China's reliance on foreign-made High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence hardware. This development is part of the US-sanctioned company's broader strategy to build a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem within China. The current HBM market is dominated by American and South Korean firms, making this a significant step in the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China. The announcement is expected at a financial AI forum in Shanghai.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has been formally asked to overturn its landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The petition comes from Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses on religious grounds. Her lawyers argue the original ruling was "egregiously wrong" and should be corrected, citing the court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade as a precedent for revisiting established rights. Legal experts consider the bid a long shot, but it represents a renewed campaign by conservative groups.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of what defines a state in international law and politics, a topic highlighted by the growing recognition of Palestine. It outlines the four criteria from the 1933 Montevideo Convention: a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into international relations. However, the article emphasizes that political recognition, particularly from the UN Security Council's permanent members, often proves to be a more significant factor than these legal benchmarks. This political dynamic explains why some widely recognized entities like Palestine and Kosovo are not yet full UN members.</p>

          <p>In Indonesia's conservative Aceh province, an Islamic Sharia court has sentenced two men, aged 20 and 21, to 80 public lashes each after they were caught in what the court deemed were sexual acts. Residents reported the men to Sharia police after they entered a park bathroom together. Aceh is the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia permitted to enforce a version of Islamic law, and this marks the fifth time people have been sentenced to caning for homosexuality since the law was implemented in 2015.</p>

          <p>The government of England and Wales is planning a major road safety overhaul that includes potentially requiring compulsory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses every three years. The proposed strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and to issue license points for not wearing a seatbelt. These changes follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current driver licensing system as the "laxest in Europe" after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

          <p>Germany's tourism sector experienced a record-breaking first half of the year, with accommodation providers logging 223.3 million overnight stays. This new peak was fueled by a strong surge in domestic travel, as more Germans chose to vacation within the country. The increase in local tourism was significant enough to more than compensate for a decline in the number of overnight stays booked by foreign visitors during the same period. The report highlights a shift in travel patterns within the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference focused on what he describes as out-of-control crime in Washington, D.C., and has threatened a potential federal takeover of the city. This follows his recent order to increase federal law enforcement presence and his suggestions of deploying the National Guard. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that while the city saw a crime spike in 2023, violent crime has since been driven down to a 30-year low, and she disputes the president's characterization of the current situation.</p>

The meeting, which notably excludes Ukrainian and European representation, grants Putin international legitimacy and a strong negotiating position, given Russia's recent advances on the battlefield. The discussions are expected to focus on potential sanctions relief for Russia in exchange for a ceasefire, raising concerns in Kyiv about a deal being struck without its involvement.

Key obstacles include the chemical complexity of certain plastics, which are difficult to break down, and the thousands of hazardous additives that can contaminate recycling streams. Furthermore, a lack of adequate infrastructure and the economic reality that producing new plastic is often cheaper than collecting and processing old material contribute to the ongoing global plastic waste crisis.</p>

For optimal protection, consumers should look for a sunscreen with a high SPF (at least 30) and a high star rating, and remember to reapply it at least every two hours.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has expanded its "deport now, appeal later" policy by adding 15 new countries, including India, Canada, and Australia, to the scheme. This brings the total number of nations covered to 23. The policy allows the government to deport foreign nationals who have committed crimes before their appeal against the removal is heard, with hearings conducted via video link from their home country. The government states the expansion is aimed at fast-tracking removals and preventing criminals from exploiting the immigration system to delay deportation.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world's top electric vehicle battery manufacturer, has temporarily stopped production at its lithium mine in Yichun, China, after its operating license expired.

          <p>The UK has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September, but only if Israel fails to meet certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving two-state solution talks. This article explains that while recognition is largely symbolic, it represents a major shift in British foreign policy, driven by the war in Gaza and intense domestic political pressure. The move, which follows similar announcements from other European nations, aims to create a "moment of maximum impact" and further isolates the U.S. position on the issue.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a small, cherry tomato-sized fireball that crashed through the roof of a house in McDonough, Georgia, was a 4.56-billion-year-old meteorite. A planetary geologist from the University of Georgia determined the space rock is slightly older than Earth itself and originated from the breakup of a large asteroid about 470 million years ago. This makes it the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia's history and one of only six whose fall was witnessed, providing a rare opportunity for scientific study.</p>
