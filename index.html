          <p>Jerry Mathers, who played 'Beaver' Cleaver, fondly recalls the wholesome environment on the set of the 1950s sitcom "Leave It to Beaver." He attributes the positive atmosphere to his on-screen father, Hugh Beaumont, who was also a Methodist minister and ensured the cast and crew maintained a professional and kind demeanor. Mathers shared that the set was a fun place for the child actors, largely because most of the crew were parents themselves. He also spoke about his enduring friendships with his co-stars, including the late Tony Dow and Ken Osmond, and his continued appreciation for the show's positive impact on audiences.</p>

          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers have stated they are "appalled" after the punk duo Bob Vylan led chants for "death to the IDF" during their performance. In a joint statement with organizer Emily Eavis, the festival declared the comments "crossed a line" and that there is no place for antisemitism or incitement to violence at the event. The BBC, which broadcast the set with a warning, confirmed it would not be available on its iPlayer service. The incident has drawn criticism from UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and antisemitism advocacy groups, with police set to review footage to determine if any offenses were committed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A critical analysis argues that a liberal media bubble perpetuates unsubstantiated claims about youth gender medicine, particularly the idea that medical transition is necessary to prevent suicide. The article highlights a recent admission in a Supreme Court hearing where an ACLU lawyer conceded there is no evidence that such treatments reduce completed suicides. It further contends that the evidence base for the so-called 'Dutch protocol' is weak, and that professional organizations like WPATH have suppressed internal doubts and unfavorable research for political reasons. The piece suggests this polarization prevents a nuanced discussion about the experimental nature of these treatments for children.</p>

He described securing a majority in the upper house for his ruling coalition as a "must-attain" but challenging goal, especially as his government faces voter concerns over inflation and stagnant wages. A recent Kyodo News poll indicated that half of respondents do not want the ruling LDP-Komeito coalition to maintain its majority.

The invitation comes amid ongoing trade tensions and diplomatic maneuvering, with the U.S. having proposed a visit by Xi in the same month. The presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin at the parade could also create a complex diplomatic dynamic for Japan and other global powers.</p>

The story details her legal battle for reinstatement, the chaotic state of the targeted agency, and the emotional toll of being labeled a "cancer" on the government by the administration.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its welfare reform bill to avert a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government mishandled the rollout and is now in a "better position" after listening to concerns that the cuts would harm disabled people. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, suggesting the bill will now pass, though the episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's authority.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision that immediately impacts legal challenges to President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision allows the administration to proceed with implementation plans in states that have not sued. This could create a fractured system where citizenship status at birth depends on location. Legal battles will continue on the merits of the case, and challengers are expected to pursue other legal avenues, such as class-action lawsuits, to block the policy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is aggressively using Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to investigate and pressure universities over issues like antisemitism and DEI programs, mirroring tactics used by the Obama administration with Title IX for sexual assault cases. This article argues that both administrations have weaponized civil rights enforcement, creating an illiberal playbook of federal overreach that threatens academic freedom and institutional autonomy. The strategy forces colleges into a double bind, risking federal funding if they don't comply with expansive and often shifting federal demands. The author suggests this cycle of bureaucratic coercion may lead to a bipartisan consensus on the need to limit the administrative state's power over higher education.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services and Its Economic Implications</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior, especially among younger generations. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon suggests this trend is a symptom of a "poor-impulse-control economy" and a response to systemic economic pressures like stagnant wages, high rent, and the normalization of debt. While BNPL offers interest-free installments, it encourages spending beyond one's means, with data showing rising losses from unpaid loans. The article explores how for many young people, using debt for small luxuries is an act of agency in an economy where traditional financial milestones feel unattainable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capability to restart uranium enrichment within "a matter of months." Despite recent U.S. and Israeli strikes causing "severe damage" to its nuclear facilities, Grossi emphasized that Iran's industrial and technological capacities are not completely destroyed. This assessment appears to temper claims by U.S. President Donald Trump that the Iranian nuclear program was "obliterated." Meanwhile, Iran's Supreme Leader asserted the country would never surrender, and its military leadership expressed doubts that Israel would maintain the recent ceasefire.</p>

This action could potentially violate rules set by an appointments watchdog, which had previously advised him not to lobby the government on the firm's behalf due to his former role as science minister.

          <p>A Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb has fired a longtime music teacher, Mark Richards, after a parent discovered an obituary for his late husband, revealing his same-sex marriage. Richards, who had taught at St. Francis Xavier school for 21 years, was dismissed for violating a morality clause in his contract that prohibits employees from being in a marriage not recognized by the Catholic Church. The firing has sparked an outcry from other parents, who have started a petition calling the decision unjust and praising Richards as a beloved teacher.

          <p>Experts warn that the lone star tick, which can cause a severe red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome, is spreading rapidly across the U.S. due to the climate crisis. Rising temperatures have allowed the aggressive tick to expand its range from the southeast to the northeast and west, potentially covering the entire eastern half of the country. Cases of alpha-gal have surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially 450,000 now, with many cases likely undiagnosed. The spread is causing significant anxiety and lifestyle changes for those affected, who must avoid all mammal products to prevent severe allergic reactions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California's common historical narratives, from visitor guides to restaurant menus, systematically erase and whitewash the state's Indigenous history. The author points out that official stories often leap from a vague, pre-colonial past to the arrival of Europeans, ignoring millennia of Indigenous civilization and the violent history of colonization, including massacres and genocide. This historical amnesia extends even to academic and activist circles at institutions like UC Berkeley, which itself played a role in plundering Indigenous graves. The author calls for a more honest and complete telling of California's past that acknowledges its foundational injustices.</p>
