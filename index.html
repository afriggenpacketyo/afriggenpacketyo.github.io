          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress amid increasing pressure from both inside and outside the central bank to lower interest rates. President Trump and other White House officials have been vocal in their criticism of Powell's monetary policy, while some Fed officials have suggested a rate cut could be appropriate as early as July. Powell's testimony will be closely watched for any signs of a shift in the Fed's stance, as traders have already increased their bets on a rate cut in the coming months. The Fed's mission is to stabilize inflation and stabilize employment and the White House's demand for dramatic action from the Fed is irresponsible (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The German government approved its draft budget for 2025, which includes a significant increase in government spending made possible by easing the country's debt brake. The budget allocates funds for repairing aging infrastructure, supporting a stimulus package for the weakening economy, and record levels of military investment. The defense budget is expected to more than double by 2029, reaching â‚¬152.8 billion, driven by growing security concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. for Europe to increase military spending.</p>

          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only play a subsidiary role in the future financial system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as a better alternative. The bank also raised concerns about the use of stablecoins for illicit activities due to the pseudonymity of public blockchains and lack of issuer oversight.</p>

Latin American teams have performed strongly, while Major League Soccer teams have largely underperformed. The tournament has faced challenges including low attendance due to weekday kickoffs and high prices, as well as difficult weather conditions.

          <p>Jessica Chaikof, who has Usher syndrome Type 1F, worries that cuts to federal research funding, particularly at Harvard, could hinder the development of gene therapies to save her eyesight. The Trump administration has cited Harvard's failure to address antisemitism as a reason for terminating grants, which Chaikof argues is harmful to Jewish individuals, especially since Usher 1F is prevalent in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Dr. David Corey, a Harvard scientist studying the protein affected by Usher 1F, says that while existing grants are not directly impacted, new grant applications are unlikely to be approved, potentially slowing down the research.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, involving two 12-hour periods of paused conflict starting with Iran. This announcement came after weeks of escalating aerial assaults between the two countries, with the U.S. recently joining the conflict by launching strikes on Iranian nuclear targets. In the hours leading up to the proposed ceasefire, Israel reported that Iran launched a barrage of missiles, causing casualties. However, an Iranian official initially denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement, but indicated that Iran would cease its response if Israel halted its strikes by a specific time.</p>

This spending will be divided between core defense and defense-related areas like resilience and security. The announcement has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who argues that the government is not providing new funding to meet this target sooner.

          <p>The All England Club plans to honor Andy Murray's contributions to tennis with a statue at Wimbledon, with hopes to unveil it by 2027, marking the 150th anniversary of the championships. Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion at Wimbledon in 2013 and triumphed again in 2016. The club is in discussions with Murray to involve him in the process. The statue would recognize Murray's special moments in the club's history.</p>

          <h2>Decline in Reading May Poison Politics, Analysts Suggest</h2>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the decline in deep reading, or sustained engagement with longform text, may be contributing to political dysfunction. Deep reading activates various linguistic and cognitive capacities, fostering connections between the text and background knowledge, while generating original thoughts. However, digital media's displacement of books is allegedly propelling society back to an ancient mode of cognition and communication akin to pre-literate oral cultures. Commentators like Andrey Mir and Adam Garfinkle argue that this reversion to orality underlies much of todayâ€™s political dysfunction, eroding commitment to pluralism, objectivity, and individual rights.</p>
