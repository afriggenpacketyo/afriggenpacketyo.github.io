          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction on a controversial immigrant detention center in Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling follows testimony regarding the project's environmental impact on a sensitive ecosystem that is home to endangered species and considered sacred by the Miccosukee Tribe. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day halt on new construction was granted to prevent potential harm while the court considers a more permanent injunction. Environmental groups and the tribe argue the project proceeded without necessary impact studies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, this article clarifies the legal process through which a debt collector can freeze a person's bank account. A collector cannot act arbitrarily and must first obtain a court judgment against the debtor, a process that involves filing a lawsuit and serving legal notice. Even with a judgment, certain funds are protected from garnishment, including Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits. For those whose accounts are frozen, options remain, such as filing exemption claims with the court or negotiating a payment plan to have the freeze lifted.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris is utilizing a Democratic Party-linked fundraising operation, the Harris Victory Fund, to market her upcoming book, sparking concerns about party neutrality ahead of potential future elections. While the Democratic National Committee confirmed it did not send the email, the use of the shared list has drawn scrutiny as Harris is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate. A spokesperson for Harris stated that the action complied with Federal Election Commission rules, which permit the use of party email lists for such promotions if paid for fairly.</p>

          <p>Ad-tech company AppLovin saw its stock jump over 10% after reporting strong quarterly earnings, continuing a significant rally. CEO Adam Foroughi indicated that the company expects future growth from the legal fallout between Apple and Epic Games, which has forced changes to Apple's App Store payment policies. Foroughi predicts that as developers are no longer required to pay Apple's commission, they will increase their advertising spend, directly benefiting platforms like AppLovin. The company's revenue increased 77% to $1.26 billion, beating analyst expectations despite facing criticism from short-selling firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking regulatory approval for a nearly $10 billion rate increase over the next four years, a move critics call the largest in U.S. history. FPL argues the hike is necessary to improve grid reliability, diversify energy sources, and ultimately reduce long-term fuel costs for customers. However, environmental groups and consumer advocates express concern that the increase will exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and disproportionately benefit company shareholders. The Florida Public Service Commission is set to hold hearings and decide on the proposal.</p>

Ellison avoided a direct answer, stating Skydance was not involved in the settlement, which was handled by the previous Paramount Global leadership.

          <p>A Santa Barbara man, David Genovese, has been sentenced to more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of animal cruelty. Prosecutors stated that Genovese adopted cats from local shelters with the express purpose of torturing and killing them. Evidence included a cat found in his vehicle with its paws bound and suffering from severe trauma, and another deceased cat discovered in his trunk. The case highlights a pattern of abuse where Genovese would acquire animals under false pretenses before inflicting fatal injuries.</p>

With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the variable rates on HELOCs are positioned to potentially decrease further, offering an advantage over fixed-rate home equity loans. Compared to high-interest credit cards and personal loans, HELOCs currently represent one of the cheapest ways to borrow.

          <p>President Trump has instructed the Department of Commerce to begin work on a new census designed to exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revives a contentious effort from his first term, which was blocked by the Supreme Court. The Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons, and changing the methodology is a complex, multi-year process that would face significant legal challenges. The Census Bureau's 2030 planning is already underway, and any such change would have major implications for political representation and federal funding distribution.</p>

Intel, a major recipient of U.S. government funding to boost domestic chip manufacturing, defended its CEO, stating a deep commitment to U.S. national security.
