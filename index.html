          <p>Sly Stone, the frontman of Sly and the Family Stone, passed away at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy that redefined pop, funk, and rock music in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Stone's innovative approach blended soul, psychedelic rock, and gospel, creating fervent and uplifting songs that resonated across generations. His music was not only groundbreaking but also socially conscious, addressing important issues of the time, making him a key progenitor of the 1970s funk sound and a lasting influence on music history.

          <p>Temu and Shein are increasingly turning their attention to Europe and the UK due to growing regulatory and trade pressures in the United States. As a result, they have boosted their advertising spending in Europe, especially in the UK and France, reflecting their strategic pivot. However, they are facing regulatory headwinds in Europe that mirror the scrutiny they've encountered in the U.S., including a proposed €2 customs fee on previously customs-free small packages. This fee could significantly reshape their operations in Europe over the next few years, requiring them to invest more in compliance and operational transparency.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," provided potentially powerful corroboration to allegations in his federal trial for sex crimes. Jane recounted instances of abuse and coercion during their relationship, alleging that Diddy forced her to take drugs before engaging in sexual activity with a male escort. Texts revealed her feelings of manipulation and desire for financial compensation, to which Diddy allegedly responded with hostility. Her testimony, along with video evidence of her injuries, contributes to the prosecution's case, though some experts note that her experience centers more on emotional manipulation than violence compared to Cassie Ventura's allegations.</p>

          <p>Following anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, President Donald Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines has sparked controversy and accusations of authoritarianism. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Trump's actions as an overreach of power and a deliberate attempt to cause chaos. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands suggests that Trump's tactics are part of a wider effort to test the limits of public tolerance and normalize actions that were previously unimaginable. The ACLU has condemned the deployment of armed troops as akin to a declaration of war on Californians, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic norms.</p>

          <p>A voluntary recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded by the FDA to Class II due to a serious health risk. The cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were mislabeled as “zero sugar” but contained the full sugar content of regular Dr Pepper, around 39 grams. This poses a significant risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming the mislabeled product could lead to hyperglycemia or even fatal ketoacidosis. The recalled cans were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and customers are urged to return them for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting legal loopholes in Europe to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for substances like salt during transit, as demonstrated by a case at Brussels Airport where a tonne of ketamine was replaced. This method takes advantage of ketamine's classification as a legal medicine in some countries, allowing it to be transported across multiple borders with less scrutiny. The drug is then diverted into the black market, where it is sold illegally, leading to increased consumption and related deaths. European police forces are planning to liaise with Indian authorities to try to tackle the problem, with Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office carrying out intensive monitoring of new psychoactive substances like ketamine.</p>

The released rice consists of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and the ministry hopes the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices.

          <p>Kyiv, Ukraine, experienced an intense aerial assault overnight, with residents reporting waves of drones and missiles and near-constant explosions. Dozens of drones were reportedly launched towards the capital, and while many were intercepted, some reached their targets, causing fires across multiple districts. Authorities confirmed at least two injuries, and the attack comes after a large-scale Russian drone strike on regions throughout Ukraine. Earlier in the day, Russia and Ukraine held the first stage of a prisoner swap following an agreement reached during peace talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who expressed concerns about potential UK complicity in Israel's conduct in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. This response followed a letter from staff questioning the UK's continued arms sales and perceived disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants stated that while the department encourages healthy challenge, resignation is an 'honourable course' for those with deep disagreements. This response has been met with frustration and disappointment by some officials, who feel the space for challenging policy is being further restricted.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report highlighting an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children. The report cites financial limitations, lack of suitable partners, and the prohibitive cost of parenthood as primary reasons. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UN agency is now focusing on low fertility issues, noting that most people surveyed want two or more children, but feel unable to create the families they desire.</p>

Hunt was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering Lane, who he had been dating for about a month. His final appeal focused on claims that prosecutors made false statements about evidence of sexual assault. Hunt acknowledged killing Lane but denied sexually assaulting her, describing himself as transformed by his time in prison and expressing remorse for his actions. The Alabama attorney general's office argued that Hunt has been on death row longer than Lane was alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk, particularly among Gen Z. Data from the CDC shows that deaths among those under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and cautious drug use among teens and young adults. While the trend is promising, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction service funding could jeopardize this recovery.</p>
