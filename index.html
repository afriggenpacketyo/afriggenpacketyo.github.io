          <h2>Chinese Mineral Tellurium Offers Hope for Restoring Vision</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully used tellurium, a rare mineral, to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals, even granting them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants, made from tellurium, convert both visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, effectively replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough holds significant potential for treating human blindness, as tellurium's photoelectric properties eliminate the need for auxiliary equipment. The study, published in Science, demonstrates a promising avenue for restoring vision and expanding visual capabilities. The research provides a potential future direction in treating blindness with the use of photoelectric properties of the tellurium to send electrical signals converted from light signals to the brain.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to clashes between residents and ICE agents during raids on undocumented migrants. The deployment follows days of unrest in a predominantly Latino district, with reports of tear gas and batons being used to disperse crowds. Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned the raids as cruel and inflammatory, while the White House asserts the actions are necessary to halt an invasion of illegal criminals. The FBI and Homeland Security chiefs criticized Mayor Karen Bass for comments perceived as endangering federal agents, escalating tensions further. The situation remains tense, with both federal and state authorities at odds over the handling of immigration enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10, a rarely used power, has raised legal and constitutional concerns. Experts like Erwin Chemerinsky argue that federalizing the National Guard without the governor's request to suppress protests is a chilling act that uses the military to stifle dissent. The ACLU has warned against the dangerous implications of using the military domestically, citing historical prohibitions against troops providing direct assistance to civilian law enforcement. Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, asserting that local law enforcement is adequately equipped to manage the situation. The deployment raises questions about federal overreach and the potential erosion of states' rights.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes and contributing to a fertility rate well below the replacement level.</p>

          <p>Japan's vulnerability to 'toilet panic' following natural disasters is highlighted in a recent report, revealing that the lack of proper sanitation can lead to public health crises. The 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake exposed the dire state of public restrooms, prompting calls for better disaster preparedness. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets to prevent infectious diseases and ensure people's well-being. Educational initiatives are underway to teach children how to use portable toilets, and recommendations include stockpiling portable toilets at home and in public spaces to avoid unhygienic conditions.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's grueling '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Venture capitalists sparked a debate by suggesting that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally. However, many founders argue that this 'fetishization of overwork' is counterproductive and clashes with European values and regulations. Instead, they emphasize the need for more funding, resources, and a focus on sustainable innovation to strengthen Europe's startup ecosystem. They believe that prioritizing worker well-being and work-life balance is essential for long-term success and talent retention.</p>

          <p>A national referendum in Italy proposing to halve the time required to apply for citizenship, from 10 years to five, has polarized the country. The referendum aims to bring Italy in line with most other European countries, but Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, deeming the current law already excellent. The outcome could affect long-term foreign residents who contribute to the Italian economy and their children, potentially granting citizenship to up to 1.4 million people. The debate highlights sensitive questions about national identity and immigration policies.</p>

The initiative aims to sign up over 10 million users in the next decade and is a key part of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's efforts to revitalize regional economies. The program involves registering via a smartphone app with local governments, who would then issue certificates, and would allow registered nonresidents to receive information on local events or services. The program is intended to encourage people to live and work in multiple areas and facilitate the flow of city dwellers into other parts of the country.</p>

The campaign also emphasizes that the original custodians and teachers of Sona were women.
