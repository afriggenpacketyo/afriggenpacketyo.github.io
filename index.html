          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants.  The judge's decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Venezuelan immigrants who argued the act's application was unlawful. The order prevents deportations for 14 days and includes all non-citizens in U.S. custody affected by Trump's proclamation.</p>
