          <p>An Israeli airstrike near Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital killed five Al Jazeera journalists. The broadcaster condemned the incident as a "targeted assassination," emphasizing the journalists were in a designated press tent. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed targeting one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, alleging he was a Hamas commander, a claim Al Jazeera and press freedom groups dispute. This event highlights the extreme dangers for local reporters covering the conflict, as international journalists are largely barred from entering Gaza.</p>

          <p>Following a successful run in the Leagues Cup, the LA Galaxy returned to MLS competition, suffering a significant 4-0 defeat to the Seattle Sounders. The match, which also celebrated the anniversary of the Galaxy's 2005 championship, highlighted the team's ongoing struggles in the domestic league. An early own goal set the tone for the lopsided match, with the Sounders capitalizing on defensive errors to score three more times. The loss severely damages the Galaxy's already slim chances of making the MLS playoffs.</p>

          <p>Tesla has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households in the United Kingdom, a move that could challenge established energy providers. If approved by the regulator Ofgem, the company could begin operations as early as next year, leveraging its existing base of electric vehicle and home battery customers. This strategic expansion into the energy market comes as Tesla faces increased competition and a recent decline in its European vehicle sales. The company already operates a similar electricity supply business in Texas.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that his country will formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September. This decision aligns Australia with other nations like the UK and France and follows what Albanese described as commitments from the Palestinian Authority to demilitarize and recognize Israel. The move aims to advance a two-state solution amid the ongoing conflict, but has drawn criticism from Israel, which views it as a "reward for terrorism." The United States has stated it will not follow suit.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's social media declarations promising a crackdown on crime and homelessness, numerous federal agents were deployed on the streets of Washington D.C. Trump vowed to remove homeless encampments and warned of a tough approach, despite official data showing a decline in the city's violent crime rates. The visible but seemingly limited deployment caused confusion among residents, while some homeless individuals expressed fear of being displaced. The action fuels ongoing debate about federal authority over the capital city's local affairs.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's first 100 days in office have been marked by political instability and criticism, with commentators describing him as a "dead man walking." His new coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD) had a chaotic start and is now navigating intense pressure from the surging far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party. Merz is attempting to implement a modernizing conservative agenda while being attacked from both the left and right, struggling to maintain a firewall against the AfD. The political climate reflects a broader trend of polarization affecting German politics.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented agreement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain advanced AI chip sales to China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for powerful semiconductors, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. The move signals a potential easing of tech trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, though it has been questioned by policy experts. This development comes as the U.S. pressures major tech firms to increase domestic investment. (not investment advice)</p>

The women, Sherri Brun and Camille Tate, stated they waited at their original gate during a nearly five-hour delay, unaware that other passengers had been rebooked on an earlier flight from a different gate.

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones create a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. When a black hole is born from a stellar collapse or the merger of two objects, the resulting distortion in spacetime rings like a bell. These vibrations, known as quasinormal modes, quickly fade as the black hole settles into a stable, perfect shape defined only by its mass and spin. This article explains that these gravitational wave signals provide a pure, predictable signature of a black hole's birth.</p>

          <p>China has launched a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under three years old. This policy is an effort to address the country's declining birth rate. According to analysis, the subsidy is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions and rural areas. For instance, the handout represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4% in the wealthy city of Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in those poorer areas.</p>

He was taken to the hospital, where scans fortunately revealed no head injury. The injury forced the promising young driver to withdraw from the following day's Cup Series race, cutting short what was planned to be a busy and important weekend for his career.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major European nations, including France, Germany, and the UK, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. The declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war. While European leaders welcomed efforts to stop the conflict, they stressed that Ukraine must have a say in its own destiny. The White House has indicated it is open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but the meeting currently remains bilateral.</p>

          <p>England's Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, 45, held his nerve after the two finished tied at 16-under par, ultimately clinching the victory with a birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one shot back, tied for third. Fleetwood's search for an elusive first victory on the PGA Tour continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The changes aim to cut red tape, allowing hospital trusts to recruit staff based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This initiative responds to warnings that there are significantly more graduates than available jobs in some areas, a situation exacerbated by record training numbers. While nursing unions welcomed the move, questions remain about how it will be funded amid tight trust budgets.</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, had reportedly become fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. Authorities identified the shooter as Patrick Joseph White, whose father said he blamed the vaccine for personal health issues. The incident, which a CDC workers' union called a direct result of vaccine misinformation, has prompted calls for federal officials to condemn such rhetoric. The union stated the attack compounds months of vilification that public health staff have endured.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case in the competition for the backup role. Lance demonstrated growing confidence, using his mobility to extend plays and scoring a five-yard touchdown on a designed run, finishing with 48 rushing yards. His performance contrasted with that of Taylor Heinicke, who looked rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the emergence of defensive end Caleb Murphy, who recorded two sacks and is making a compelling argument for a roster spot.</p>
