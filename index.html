          <p>China-Philippine relations are at a crucial juncture as Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s efforts to diminish the influence of Rodrigo Duterte's faction face setbacks, particularly after the recent midterm elections. Observers suggest that Duterte, potentially cleared of impeachment charges, might emerge as a strong contender in the 2028 presidential election, potentially shifting the country's stance on China. The election results indicate that Marcos's allies secured fewer Senate seats than anticipated, while Duterte's allies gained significant ground, which could safeguard her from conviction and enable her to compete in the upcoming presidential race. Qi Huaigao, a professor at Fudan University, noted that Marcos failed to eliminate Duterte's political dynasty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri's near-total abortion ban could return if voters approve a new ballot measure passed by the state legislature. The GOP-controlled Missouri Senate passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would repeal an earlier amendment passed by voters last year that enshrined abortion protections in the state's constitution. The proposed amendment, which passed in Missouri's GOP-controlled House last month, would go on the state's ballots in Missouri's 2026 general election, or sooner if the governor calls a special election. If passed, the new measure would include exceptions for sexual assault and incest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly hostile stance towards South Africa is rooted in a combination of factors, including interactions with Afrikaner activists, disagreements over Israel's actions in Gaza, and a broader agenda to eliminate diversity and inclusion initiatives. Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa, influenced by figures like golfer Gary Player and amplified by media personalities like Tucker Carlson, have shaped U.S. foreign policy. The administration has halted aid to South Africa, prioritized Afrikaner refugees, and expelled the South African ambassador, citing concerns about race-based discrimination. These actions reflect a broader focus on white victimhood and a desire to reshape U.S. foreign policy based on these narratives.</p>

          <p>While some Afrikaners are seeking refugee status in the U.S. based on claims of persecution, many others are committed to staying in South Africa and contributing to its future. Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, a white South African with a large social media following, promotes South Africa and dismisses the notion that Afrikaners are refugees, instead calling those who leave 'opportunists.' Despite concerns about crime and economic inequality, many Afrikaners view themselves as African and want to help build a better future for all in South Africa. Ilse Steenkamp, who lost her farm to an invasion, believes Afrikaners facing such attacks should be treated as refugees.</p>

          <p>Missouri Republicans are attempting to reinstate a near-total abortion ban through a new ballot measure, despite voters overturning a similar ban in November. The legislature approved a measure that would amend the state Constitution to ban abortion except in medical emergencies, or in cases of sexual assault or incest if reported to police within 48 hours and the pregnancy is less than 12 weeks along. This move bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in recent ballot measures. Abortion rights groups have condemned the measure as a direct assault on voters and deceptive in its language.</p>

          <p>Smartmatic has alleged that Fox News and Fox Corp. destroyed text messages related to the 2020 election claims, including those of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. The company claims this destruction created an evidentiary void, eliminating contemporaneous texts that would have revealed what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts. This filing comes as Fox secured a ruling granting them access to documents related to a DOJ investigation into Smartmatic executives. Fox dismissed Smartmatic's motion as a distraction, claiming Smartmatic failed to preserve evidence, including instructions from its CEO to delete relevant text messages.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Proposes Pausing Expansion of Healthcare Coverage for Immigrants Due to Budget Deficit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded healthcare benefits for low-income immigrants without legal status in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected program costs and economic uncertainty. While those already enrolled will not be affected, new applications will be frozen, and starting in 2027, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' will have to pay a monthly premium. Newsom attributed the budget shortfalls to President Trump's tariff policies and defended the decision as necessary to maintain fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, has been arrested and charged with aiding in the commission of terrorism for allegedly buying ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who investigators say was planning 'mass targeted violence' at a San Antonio school. Pardo allegedly provided material support despite knowing about her son's desire to commit acts of mass violence and being contacted by authorities. The son was found to have a homemade explosive device and a note referencing mass shooters. The affidavit says Pardo expressed support of her son's violent expressions and drawings and does not feel concerned for his behavior.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial, alleging years of coerced sex, violence, and threats that led to addiction and suicidal thoughts.

This decision comes in response to what State Farm described as a 'dire' financial situation following the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, will provide the company with a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. State Farm has also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

The brothers' lawyers argued that under today's mores the brothers merited a second chance.
