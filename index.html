          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a planned partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, asserting that the deal will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Trump stated that U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh and the bulk of the investment will occur over the next 14 months. This announcement follows President Biden's previous blockage of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel due to national security concerns, a decision Trump reversed after ordering a new review.</p>

          <p>A 443-foot container ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground in Norway, coming within feet of a cabin while the owner was asleep. The helmsman was reportedly also asleep at the time of the incident, according to Norwegian media, and police have opened an investigation into the matter. The homeowner, Johan Helberg, was alerted by a neighbor who saw the ship heading towards land at full speed. While the ship caused minor damage to a heating pipe, Helberg considers himself lucky it didn't hit a nearby rocky cliff, which could have caused more significant damage.</p>

          <p>A Paris court found eight individuals guilty in connection with the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian during Paris Fashion Week, where she was held at gunpoint and millions of dollars' worth of jewelry was stolen.

Kardashian, who testified that she feared for her life during the robbery, expressed satisfaction with the court's ruling, stating she was grateful to French authorities for pursuing justice and that the crime had a lasting impact on her and her family.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after former President Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. These statements led to a sell-off in the stock market as investors sought safety in bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 3 basis points to 5.031%, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell by 4 basis points to 4.509%.

A federal judge swiftly issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause “immediate and irreparable injury” to the university.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court orders requiring the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to turn over information to a government watchdog group. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) seeking information about DOGE's operations and personnel. The Trump administration argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body not subject to FOIA, while CREW contends it wields substantial independent authority, making it a de facto agency.
