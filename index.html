          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was the justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, states that the Maduro regime likely does not have a policy of cooperating with the gang, despite some lower-level officials profiting from their activities. This revelation has led to criticism of the Trump administration's policy and the subsequent criminal investigation into media coverage of the issue. The ACLU has requested the return of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador for proper immigration hearings, citing evidence that some may not be gang members.</p>

The unexpected result marks a historic moment in post-war Germany, the first time a candidate has failed in this manner since 1949.

          <p>Hugo Boss has cautioned that declining U.S. consumer confidence, influenced by tariffs, recession concerns, and immigration policies, is negatively affecting domestic and tourist spending in its largest market. CEO Daniel Grieder noted a decrease in U.S. shopper demand, with first-quarter sales declining 1% annually, but said it was too soon to assess the full impact of U.S. policies. While the company's exposure to U.S. tariffs is currently contained, Hugo Boss is implementing strategic measures, such as redirecting products and optimizing its global sourcing footprint, to mitigate potential fallout.</p>

Mahdawi, who helped lead Columbia's protests against the Israel-Hamas war, denies allegations of antisemitism and maintains his commitment to peace. He sued in federal court, arguing his detention violated his First Amendment rights, and a judge ordered his release, citing substantial claims of retaliation for protected speech.</p>

Judge Richard Myers stated that removing votes six months after the election would violate due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the state board of elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, though he delayed the decision for a week in case of appeal.

          <p>A slump in U.S. exports, initially triggered by reduced imports due to Trump's tariffs, has now expanded to encompass nearly all U.S. exports, with the agricultural sector particularly affected. Trade data reveals significant declines in exports at major ports, linked to decreased containership arrivals and shifts in global demand. Retailers are urging consumers to purchase goods sooner rather than later, as escalating trade disruptions are expected to cause a 15%-20% decrease in U.S. container imports from Asia.

Pabst, who returned to Nazi Germany in 1939 to direct films under Joseph Goebbels's supervision. The novel examines the gray zone between victim and perpetrator, portraying Pabst as a man who gradually allows his resistance to erode, making defensible choices that lead to an unacceptable outcome. The story draws inspiration from Kehlmann's family history and the ambiguities surrounding Pabst's choices, exploring the question of how far one should go to create great art.

          <p>Authorities have charged a second suspect with murder in the death of Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, who was found dead in his hotel room while covering the Super Bowl. Rickey White, already arrested on robbery and fraud charges, is now accused of second-degree murder in connection with Manzano's death. The first suspect, Danette Colbert, was previously charged with second-degree murder and theft. Manzano's autopsy revealed he died from ingesting alcohol and Xanax, and authorities believe Colbert gave him the drug before stealing his belongings.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, failed to secure the necessary majority in a parliament vote to become chancellor, despite his coalition holding enough seats. The unexpected outcome is unprecedented in modern German history, as no candidate has failed in this way since 1949. The Bundestag now has 14 days to elect a chancellor, leaving Merz's future uncertain. This failure undermines Merz's hopes of providing stability after the previous government's collapse and has been seized upon by the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge that saw it reach multi-decade gains, fueled by speculation of pressure from Washington to strengthen the currency. It weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, following a 9% rally in the previous two trading days. Despite the recent decline, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% this year against the greenback. The recent upward swings were largely driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings.</p>

The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screening for mandatory outpatient treatment after discharge from hospitals and jails, and increasing supportive housing units and psychiatric beds. Cuomo's plan mirrors similar proposals by Mayor Adams and Governor Hochul, focusing on removing people who pose a danger to themselves or the public.
