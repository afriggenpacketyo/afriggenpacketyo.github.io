        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining crucial access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated the ruling affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers and acquisitions. Following the news, Chevron's shares saw initial gains before closing slightly lower, while Exxon's stock fell more than 3%.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bipartisan bill aims to provide clear rules for issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, which the administration believes will strengthen the U.S. dollar and upgrade the financial system. During the signing ceremony, Trump celebrated the legislation as a fulfillment of his promise to make the U.S. a leader in financial technology. The move is seen by the crypto community as a significant step towards mainstream adoption and validation.</p>

          <p>Three veteran officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were killed following an explosion at a law enforcement training facility in East Los Angeles. The blast occurred in the parking lot of the Biscailuz Center, which houses the department's bomb squad and other special units. Sheriff Robert Luna described the incident as the department's largest single loss of life since its founding in 1857. While the official cause is under investigation with assistance from federal agencies, sources suggest the officers were handling an unexploded ordnance when it detonated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced that nearly 60,000 metric tons of food aid are in the process of being distributed worldwide, countering reports that stockpiled supplies were being incinerated. Officials clarified that all food expiring before October 2026 has already been programmed for delivery to crisis areas, including Syria and Sudan. This response comes after criticism over the destruction of about 500 tons of emergency food and a broader restructuring that saw USAID's functions absorbed by the State Department. The department emphasized its commitment to efficiently managing and delivering life-saving assistance under its new operational model.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump introduces a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visitors to the United States, including international students and temporary skilled workers. This fee is part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and is effective for the current fiscal year, with future amounts to be adjusted for inflation. While the law suggests the fee may be reimbursable if visa holders comply with all terms, such as timely departure, the mechanisms for collection and reimbursement have not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this and other new charges create significant financial barriers for legal immigration pathways.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis from the Tax Policy Center indicates that the newly enacted "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will result in an average tax saving of approximately $2,900 per household in 2026. The legislation extends many provisions of the 2017 tax cuts while adding new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. However, the report highlights that the benefits are disproportionately aimed at higher-income households, with the top 20% of earners expected to receive about 60% of the total tax relief. Lower-income families are projected to see a much smaller relative benefit from the new tax structure. (not investment advice)</p>

The law establishes clear regulations and consumer protections, allowing banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. This framework is expected to increase public trust and accelerate the integration of stablecoins into mainstream financial services, aligning with the Trump administration's goal of promoting the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>The parents of Kaylee Goncalves, one of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022, say they are still without answers regarding a motive after Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty. With a gag order now lifted, Steve and Kristi Goncalves expressed their frustration, stating that the plea deal which spared Kohberger the death penalty has left them in the dark. Their attorney is now requesting discovery materials from prosecutors in hopes of learning more about the crime. The family described Kohberger as showing "zero remorse" and believes hiding the full truth only protects the killer.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed that its affluent customer base continues to spend freely, with a 7% increase in total card spending for the second quarter, matching the previous quarter's growth. However, the company noted a specific weak spot in travel, as spending on airline tickets remained flat compared to last year, primarily due to lower domestic economy airfare prices. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings remain strong, the stall in airline spending is a point of concern for investors. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, Amex shares fell amid concerns about increased competition in the premium card market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to mounting public and political pressure, President Trump announced he has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bondi confirmed the Justice Department is prepared to petition the court for the unsealing, a move that requires judicial approval due to strict secrecy rules. The announcement followed a report about a letter bearing Trump's signature in a birthday book for Epstein. Critics, however, argue that releasing only the transcripts would be insufficient, demanding access to all evidence, including interviews, photos, and videos.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed look into the long and complex relationship between Donald Trump and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The two frequently socialized at parties in New York and Palm Beach, and Trump once praised Epstein as a "terrific guy." A new report from The Wall Street Journal adds another layer, describing a cryptic message from Trump in a 2003 birthday book for Epstein, which Trump claims is fake. Their friendship reportedly ended in a bitter dispute in 2004, years before Epstein's high-profile sex trafficking indictments.</p>

Her research, detailed in a new book, challenges the historical account she attributes to Tudor propaganda. While some historians remain skeptical, Langley argues the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes were killed.</p>

Additionally, the EU sanctioned more Russian banks and numerous non-EU shipping vessels believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet."
