          <p>Kim Jong-un's decision to skip Russia's Victory Day parade signals a complex diplomatic strategy, as his attendance would have been a rare opportunity for a North Korean leader to participate in a high-profile international event. Instead, Kim's absence conveys restraint, retreat, and defiance, avoiding an awkward spotlight alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and public alignment with Putin that could strain ties with China. Kim instead visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, reaffirming the "blood-sealed" alliance with Russia while managing relations with Beijing. The article suggests Kim's choice reflects a nuanced approach to international relations amid geopolitical complexities.</p>

          <p>A car ramming incident at the Liverpool F.C. Premier League title celebration injured almost 50 people, including four children, causing scenes of horror during what should have been a joyous event. The British police arrested a 53-year-old white man from Britain, the driver of the vehicle, but have stated that the incident is not being treated as terrorism. Video footage shows the vehicle swerving into the crowd, hitting parade-goers, and witnesses attempting to stop the car.

          <p>Four former top executives of Nissan Motor Co., including ex-President and CEO Makoto Uchida, received a combined total of $4.5 million in severance pay, raising investor concerns. The payouts come after unsuccessful merger talks with Honda and amid plans to cut thousands of jobs, with the company projecting a net loss of 670.9 billion yen for the fiscal year ended March. Nissan faces pressure from faltering vehicle sales in China and the United States, and the new CEO, Ivan Espinosa, is working to streamline global operations to restore profitability.

          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in central Japan led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament, marking the second time in less than two weeks that wild animals disrupted a pro golf tournament. Reina Maeda, who was leading after the second round, was declared the winner of the tournament. The incident highlights the increasing encounters between humans and bears in Japan, attributed to climate change affecting food sources and hibernation times, as well as depopulation in rural areas. The Japanese government has approved a bill allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas as a result.</p>

          <p>UK ministers are considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledges that the policy has pushed people into poverty, but warns that removing the cap would be costly. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, alongside its child poverty strategy, with Phillipson emphasizing that the "cost of inaction" is also incredibly high due to its impact on children's life chances.</p>

The shooting occurred while different groups of people were gathered in the park, and authorities believe a gun modification known as a "switch," which can make a semi-automatic handgun fully automatic, may have been used. No weapons have been recovered, and no arrests have been made as investigators analyze shell casings and social media footage to determine the number of shooters and the types of weapons used.</p>

          <p>China, the worldâ€™s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall emissions for the first time, even as energy demand and economic activity increased. This shift is attributed to China's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, outpacing electricity demand growth and reducing reliance on coal and gas. The decline puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, including peaking emissions before 2030. The article suggests that China's investments in clean energy, both domestically and through exports, are contributing to global climate goals, although concerns remain about emissions of other greenhouse gases and the potential for future increases.</p>

          <p>Politicians are trying to boost manufacturing in the U.S. due to the belief that these jobs are special, and this article explores whether that belief is justified. Research suggests that manufacturing jobs pay a premium, especially for workers without a college education, although this premium varies by subsector. The reasons for this premium may include a history of unionization, the need to compensate for potentially unpleasant working conditions, and the need for skilled workers to handle expensive machinery. The article concludes that manufacturing continues to offer good jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, but that focus should also be placed on creating good jobs in the service sector.</p>

The Ukrainian president's appeal comes as U.S.-brokered peace talks have stalled, with Trump expressing frustration and Kyiv pushing for a 30-day ceasefire.

Experts warn against restarting the plant under current conditions, and the move goes against recent efforts to discuss the plant's fate as part of peace talks.

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka underwent brain surgery following his IBF world minimumweight title defeat, leading to his retirement from the sport. Shigeoka, 25, was not knocked down during the bout but lost consciousness after the decision was announced and was subsequently hospitalized. Japan Boxing Commission rules prohibit boxers who have had brain surgery from holding a professional license. Shigeoka won the minimumweight title in 2023, with his older brother also winning the WBC title in the same division.</p>

          <p>England goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football, just weeks before the Lionesses are set to defend their European Championship title. The 32-year-old played a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory but had recently lost her starting position to Hannah Hampton. Earps made 53 senior appearances for England over eight years, also winning the 2023 Women's Finalissima and reaching the final of the 2023 Women's World Cup. England manager Sarina Wiegman expressed disappointment, while Earps stated that it was the right time to give younger players an opportunity.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) terminated or rescinded hundreds of previously awarded grants to arts organizations nationwide, citing a shift in funding priorities dictated by the President. The NEA stated it would focus on projects reflecting the nationâ€™s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President. This move has been criticized as politically motivated, targeting projects and institutions deemed insufficiently American, and undermining the NEA's role in supporting diverse and essential components of the aesthetic infrastructure. The article argues that art should be uncoupled from commerce and that the NEA represents a vital source of support for arts organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the increasing political divide between young men and women, where young men are more likely to support right-wing parties. The author argues that the shift is not primarily due to social issues, but rather the changing economy over the past half-century. The decline of manufacturing jobs has disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity, lower social trust, and more regressive gender norms. The article suggests that redefining men's role in an inclusive way, focusing on both caretaking and producing, is crucial to address the crisis of masculinity.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was rapidly carved around 2.1 million years ago, when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow. Researchers analyzed ancient river sediments found inside the canyon's caves, which now lie high above the Snake River. The findings indicate that the canyon is younger than the Grand Canyon and emerged when a huge lake drained away, leading to a "fill and spill" episode that carved out Hells Canyon.</p>

          <p>Japan views President Trump's tariffs as a "national crisis" due to the threat they pose to its economy and the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy. Japan's limited room for maneuver in tariff negotiations with the U.S. and its reliance on the U.S. for security make the situation particularly challenging.
