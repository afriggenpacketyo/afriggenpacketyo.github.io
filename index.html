          <p>An international coalition of activists, including prominent figures like Greta Thunberg and Susan Sarandon, is preparing a flotilla to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. The mission aims to challenge the Israeli blockade and bring essential supplies like food and medicine to the territory, where experts have warned of famine conditions. The convoy, consisting of around 20 boats from 44 countries, highlights the ongoing efforts to address the severe humanitarian crisis resulting from the prolonged conflict. Organizers and participants emphasize that the action is a response to continuous violations of international law that prevent aid from reaching civilians in desperate need.</p>

          <p>Ireland's women's rugby team has advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals after a high-scoring 43-27 victory against Spain. Despite a spirited performance from the Spanish side, which managed five tries, the Irish team secured a bonus point by halftime with seven tries of their own. Key performances from Anna McGann and Grace Moore, who both scored twice, were crucial in sealing the win. The victory ensures Ireland's progression in the tournament, though their celebration was tempered by an injury to co-captain Sam Monaghan, adding to their team's existing injury concerns.</p>

          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's 31-17 upset loss to Florida State, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith commented that the era of Nick Saban's dominance at the university is "long gone." The defeat snapped Alabama's 23-game winning streak in season openers and highlighted challenges for the team under new coach Kalen DeBoer. Smith pointed to issues such as surrendered sacks, dropped passes, and quarterback limitations as signs of a significant shift for the college football powerhouse. The loss marks a difficult start to the post-Saban era, with a tough schedule ahead for the team.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts her journey from a liberal, urban background to becoming a hunter in Montana, challenging the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left. She argues that hunting is a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming, emphasizing the deep connection to nature and responsibility it fosters. The author describes the emotional gravity of taking an animal's life and the community she has found among other hunters who are conservationists and food-conscious individuals. The piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of hunting, separating it from negative political stereotypes and gun culture debates.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist Amy Morin shares her personal story of resilience and reinvention after her husband died suddenly when she was 26. Believing she would not remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who became her second husband and biggest supporter. Morin explains that her marriage to Hasty opened up new possibilities she had never imagined, encouraging her to leave her stable therapy job to become a full-time author and speaker.

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta details advancements in chronic pain treatment, focusing on a method called "reverse translational research." This approach prioritizes the patient's lived experience, using it to guide lab-based science rather than the other way around. This has led to breakthroughs in identifying objective biomarkers for subjective pain by mapping unique neural signals in the brain. The article highlights how this research has enabled the use of deep brain stimulation to predict and intercept pain signals, offering a revolutionary, though not yet widely available, treatment that underscores the brain's central role in chronic pain.</p>

          <p>An analysis details the potential consequences of President Donald Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook. Experts and former Fed officials warn that such moves threaten the central bank's long-standing political independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability. Politicizing the Fed could undermine its credibility in fighting inflation and managing monetary policy, potentially leading to long-term economic damage. While Trump's goal is to lower interest rates to boost the economy and manage debt, critics fear it could lead to the kind of hyperinflation seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing on the U.S. mainland. The sport was first introduced in 1885 by three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were studying at a nearby military school. Using surfboards fashioned from local redwood trees, they demonstrated the royal Hawaiian tradition of "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. This act of cultural exchange planted the seed for what would become a major American sport, a history that is often overlooked but is now being celebrated.</p>

By firing key officials, including the NLRB chair, the administration has left the board without a quorum, rendering it unable to issue decisions and enforce labor laws. This, combined with a wave of corporate legal challenges to the agency's constitutionality, threatens to return workers' rights to the precarious state they were in before the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, leaving workers with little recourse against unfair labor practices.</p>

          <p>An essay delves into the common feeling of guilt or unease about experiencing personal happiness while the world is rife with suffering and political turmoil. Drawing on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that feeling others' pain is a moral response. However, this empathy should extend to sharing in others' joys as well. The piece suggests that allowing oneself to feel both the world's horror and its delight is not a contradiction but a form of resistance against despair and a vital part of being a connected, resilient human being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced plans to "fix" the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a move that experts fear could involve canceling compensation for individuals who suffer rare vaccine side effects. Critics argue that dismantling or severely altering the program could destabilize the vaccine market by exposing manufacturers to increased litigation, potentially causing them to exit the market and leading to shortages. Such actions would also undermine public trust in vaccines and make it harder for the few individuals who do experience severe adverse reactions to receive financial support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still claim the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, which is set to expire. According to the IRS, a buyer does not need to have physical possession of the vehicle by the September 30 deadline. Instead, a consumer can qualify by entering into a "written binding contract" and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before that date. This clarification provides a crucial grace period for individuals who have ordered an EV but are still awaiting its delivery from the dealer or manufacturer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is facing significant hurdles in the federal court system. In at least five recent cases, grand juries have refused to issue indictments against residents accused of assaulting federal officers, an unusual rebuke of prosecutors' cases. Judges have also expressed frustration with the government's missteps and the strain on court resources from the surge in federal filings. This resistance from both jurors and the judiciary suggests that the White House's law-and-order push is built on shaky legal ground and is unpopular with the local populace that makes up the jury pool.</p>

          <p>A former National Guard member argues in an opinion piece that the increasing use of the Guard for domestic law enforcement and to fill civilian job shortages is a dangerous trend for American democracy. This practice blurs the critical line between military and civilian authority, erodes public trust, and casts citizen-soldiers as occupiers in their own communities. The author contends that politicians are using the Guard as a convenient stopgap for underfunded public services and complex social issues, avoiding the necessary long-term policy solutions. This misuse also degrades the Guard's readiness for its intended missions of disaster response and national defense.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration is now actively dismantling the COVID-19 vaccine program that was a signature achievement of its first term. Under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F.

The administration is also promoting unsubstantiated claims about vaccine dangers, a move that public health experts warn will undermine confidence in vaccines and restrict access for Americans who want and need them, potentially reversing years of public health progress.</p>

To achieve this, the team plans to implement a more physical running game, a hallmark of Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman. However, their strategy faces a major challenge with the season-ending knee injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater, placing Herbert's protection in the hands of a rookie. The season will be a critical test of whether Herbert can finally join the league's elite tier of quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of "killfies"—selfies taken in high-risk situations leading to injury or death—remains a serious global issue, with studies showing India consistently records the highest number of fatalities. Despite public awareness campaigns and the creation of no-selfie zones, people continue to take dangerous photos at heights, near bodies of water, and with wild animals. Researchers indicate that the desire for social media validation often overrides judgment, with men being involved in roughly three-quarters of the incidents. A troubling finding is that rescue attempts often lead to multiple fatalities, compounding the tragedy of a single risky act.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, has announced a major shift in climate policy, pledging to remove all net-zero requirements on North Sea oil and gas companies to maximize fossil fuel extraction. This plan reverses the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and aligns with calls to prioritize economic activity over environmental regulations. The move has been condemned by opponents and environmental groups as reckless, arguing it will accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills for consumers. The policy stands in stark contrast to the Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses.</p>
