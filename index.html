          <p>Following the discovery of thousands of abandoned chicks in a USPS truck in Delaware, a local animal shelter successfully found homes for the surviving birds. The First State Animal Center and SPCA adopted out over 5,000 chickens, turkeys, and quails to local families, rescues, and farms after they were left unattended in high temperatures without food or water, leading to the death of many. The shelter ensured that the adopters would not use the birds for meat, and the community rallied to provide donations and care for the animals, highlighting a positive outcome from a distressing situation.</p>

          <p>The German economy saw unexpected growth of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis). This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Meanwhile, the new German government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions. This economic upturn provides a positive sign amidst ongoing global trade tensions and domestic policy considerations within Germany.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, citing concerns over antisemitism and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the university has fostered violence, antisemitism, and unsafe campus environment. Harvard has rejected these allegations, calling the action unlawful and retaliatory, and has vowed to support its international students. Beijing has criticized the move as a politicization of educational exchanges, as the situation threatens to impact nearly 6,800 international students at Harvard.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa took an unexpected turn as Trump focused on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. Instead of addressing serious issues like tariffs and aid cuts, Trump showcased a video of an opposition party leader chanting about killing white farmers. This spectacle undermined potential discussions on critical matters between the two countries, revealing Trump's disinterest in reasoned negotiation and his preference for scoring points with his base, as the meeting highlighted deep divisions and a lack of productive engagement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to block Harvard from enrolling international students is being viewed in China as a blow to one of the last admirable American institutions. The move is expected to disproportionately affect Chinese students, who constitute the largest group of international students at Harvard. This action could reshape the broader relationship between the two countries by diminishing the appeal of American universities, which have long been a source of aspiration for many Chinese. The decision has elicited mixed reactions in China, ranging from concern and outrage to grim acceptance and even glee.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched an investigation into an accident during the launch of its second naval destroyer, blaming the incident on criminal negligence. Sections of the bottom of the newly built 5,000-ton naval destroyer were crushed during the launch ceremony due to a transport cradle detaching early. Kim Jong Un criticized military officials and shipyard operators for the incident, but later reports indicated that the damage to the vessel was not serious and would take nearly 10 days to repair.</p>
