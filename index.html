          <p>The Supreme Court's 4-to-4 vote prevented the nationâ€™s first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, seemingly halting the conservative movement to expand government funding for religious education. However, this ruling may be a minor setback as conservatives are pushing a school voucher movement, which has gained traction in Republican state legislatures and is nearing nationwide implementation. The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, setting aside $5 billion to fund private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning for families. This bill, structured as a tax credit, is expected to benefit wealthy taxpayers and could significantly increase the number of students using public funds for religious education, potentially reaching as many as 1 million students nationwide.</p>

          <p>A cargo ship, the NCL Salten, ran aground in Byneset, Norway, narrowly missing a house after the officer guiding the ship reportedly fell asleep. Johan Helberg, a retiree whose house was nearly hit, was alerted by a neighbor after the ship came within yards of his bedroom. The police are investigating the incident, focusing on the officer on watch, who admitted to falling asleep, an explanation that has happened before.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reached a deal with Boeing to avoid prosecution over the two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The non-prosecution agreement allows Boeing to avoid being labeled a felon, averting a trial scheduled for next month. Under the 2021 settlement, Boeing agreed to pay a $2.51 billion fine, including a $243.6 million criminal penalty, a $500 million fund for crash victims' families, and $1.77 billion for airline customers. While the DOJ argues this agreement serves the public interest by guaranteeing accountability and benefits, families of the crash victims have criticized previous deals as lenient and are calling for greater accountability from the company and its executives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the United States from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America, reigniting trade tensions. Trump stated that discussions with the EU are "going nowhere" and that the new tariffs would kick in on June 1. The announcements have sparked worries globally, causing shares in the US and EU to fall, with the S&P 500 down about 1% and Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ending the day down more than 1.5%. Analysts remain skeptical whether these threats will materialize, but the EU has indicated it is prepared to retaliate with its own tariffs on US products.</p>

The orders focus on small advanced reactors, streamlining the licensing process and creating a regulatory framework for building reactors on federal land, with the goal of jump-starting uranium mining and expanding domestic enrichment capacity.</p>

Trump stated that the EU "has been very difficult to deal with" and that he is "not looking for a deal," emphasizing that "it's time that we play the game the way I know how to play the game." The announcement, made shortly after a threat to impose tariffs on Apple's iPhones, caused U.S. stock futures to sink and European stock markets to fall.

Analysts believe that producing iPhones in the U.S. is not feasible and would significantly increase costs for consumers. Apple has been shifting production to countries like India and Vietnam to avoid tariffs, but Trump's latest remarks underscore the challenges businesses face in navigating the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel, the iconic singer-songwriter, has canceled all of his upcoming concerts, including a large-scale tour scheduled for this year and next, due to a brain disorder known as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition has led to "problems with hearing, vision and balance," according to a statement released by Joel. NPH is a rare condition that occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms that include trouble walking and controlling oneâ€™s bladder, and can also lead to cognitive impairment. Refunds for customers would be automatic, his statement said.</p>

          <p>A fifth person has been arrested in connection with the escape of 10 inmates from a New Orleans jail, authorities said. Casey Smith, 29, is accused of assisting two of the escaped inmates. Smith's arrest follows the apprehension of Connie Weeden, 59, who was in contact with escapee Jermaine Donald and provided him with cash. Sterling Williams, a maintenance worker at the jail, was previously arrested for disabling water to a cell used in the escape. The brazen escape occurred on May 16, with five inmates still at large.</p>

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt, typically occurring after 180 days of missed payments, can have severe and lasting consequences. The article highlights that while default doesn't happen immediately after a missed payment, it can significantly damage credit scores for up to seven years, making it harder to secure loans or rent an apartment. The card issuer will typically charge off the debt, meaning they write it off as a loss and may sell it to a third-party collection agency. The article is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Israel is facing increasing diplomatic pressure from international allies due to its actions in Gaza, described as a "diplomatic tsunami" by Israeli media.

The EU is also considering reviewing its association agreement with Israel. This wave of condemnation follows growing concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and accusations of extremism within the Israeli government.

Supply chain experts say shifting iPhone production to the United States in 2025 would be foolish. The iPhone is nearly 20 years old.
