          <p>The fifth episode of The Celebrity Traitors saw contestants, including David Olusoga and Kate Garraway, express deep frustration over their inability to identify the "traitors." Following the elimination of singer Charlotte Church, presenter Claudia Winkleman admonished the group for losing seven faithfuls, leading to increased tension. Cracks began to show among the treacherous trio of Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns, with Burns even raising suspicions about Ross during a tense roundtable. The episode concluded with a dramatic tied vote between Mark Bonnar and David Olusoga, leaving the banishment to a twist of fate, intensifying the game's stakes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced a 12% revenue increase in the third quarter, ending two periods of decline, yet its stock fell 3% as earnings per share missed analyst estimates. The profit drop was attributed to lower EV prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly due to AI and R&D projects. The article notes a sales slump in Europe linked to consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk and increased competition. Tesla aims for "volume production" of Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Megapack 3 by 2026, while its energy generation and storage business saw significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a surprise profit for the third quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations, and projected record sales for the current quarter. This positive outlook is driven by robust travel demand and higher fares, with the carrier expecting a 1% to 3% rise in unit revenue and a 6% increase in capacity for the fourth quarter. Despite previously cutting its 2025 profit forecast, which was reaffirmed, Southwest is actively working to enhance its competitiveness. Strategic changes, such as abandoning its long-standing open seating policy, are anticipated to significantly boost sales in the upcoming periods, reflecting a strong recovery trajectory for the airline.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military conducted its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, this time in the Pacific off Colombia, resulting in two fatalities. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was operated by a designated terrorist organization involved in narco-trafficking. Senator Mark Kelly raised serious concerns regarding the legal and constitutional justification for these strikes, which have now killed at least 34 people. The Trump administration defends these operations as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, arguing their illicit activities kill tens of thousands of Americans annually, thus constituting an "armed attack."</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees from its artificial intelligence unit as part of an effort to streamline operations and strengthen Alexandr Wang's leadership. The cuts impact various AI infrastructure, research (FAIR), and product-related roles, but spare the recently formed Superintelligence Labs under Wang. This move reflects CEO Mark Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's AI progress and the company's aggressive overhaul to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Meta continues to pour billions into AI infrastructure and recruitment, with expenses expected to rise significantly in 2026.</p>

Analysts attribute the plunge to profit-taking, a strengthening U.S. dollar making gold more expensive for international buyers, and easing geopolitical and economic fears. The article advises investors to consider the dip as a potential buying opportunity for long-term hedging, but also to remain selective, diversified, and attentive to market signals like interest rates and inflation data.

          <p>IBM reported third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations and increased its full-year guidance, attributing the strong performance to ongoing artificial intelligence tailwinds. Despite these positive indicators, the company's stock dropped 5% in extended trading. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that clients are leveraging IBM's technology and expertise to drive productivity with AI, and the company's AI book of business has grown significantly. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with strong growth in software and consulting, but the stock's reaction indicates investor skepticism or profit-taking despite the positive fundamentals.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a new memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress. This policy mandates that all communications, including requests for information from congressional committees, must be funneled through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The memo, also signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg, explicitly states that "unauthorized engagements" by DoD personnel could undermine departmental legislative objectives. This move centralizes control over the flow of information to Capitol Hill, raising concerns about transparency, oversight, and the traditional checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches, with only the Office of the Inspector General exempted.</p>

          <p>New data from the FDIC reveals traditional savings accounts offer negligible returns, averaging just 0.40%, which fails to keep pace with inflation. In stark contrast, high-yield savings accounts typically offer rates between 4.20% and 4.30%, with potential for even higher returns online. This article demonstrates how deposits from $500 to $10,000 can earn hundreds of dollars in interest over a year, significantly outperforming traditional options. It also advises considering Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts for fixed rates, offering stability against future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Parias, who has documented ICE raids and community events, faces charges of assault on a federal officer.

          <p>President Donald Trump reportedly dined at the White House with media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his top lieutenants last week, despite Trump's active $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from a Journal report alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" 50th birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump vehemently denies. The dinner, which included chicken and gravy, occurred just days before Trump's legal team filed a strong response to Murdoch's motion to dismiss the case. This unusual interaction highlights the complex relationship between Trump and Murdoch's conservative media empire.</p>

          <p>Israeli lawmakers have voted to advance two bills proposing the formal annexation of the West Bank, a move opposed by President Trump, who stated he would "not allow" it. This vote occurred during Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel, aimed at solidifying the Gaza ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party called for abstentions, viewing the vote as a "provocation" damaging US relations. Far-right ministers celebrated the advance, using biblical terms for the West Bank. The Palestinian foreign ministry and Jordan strongly condemned the votes, asserting they violate international law and undermine a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to increase by a substantial 40% this year, reaching $1.32 per pound, just ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday season. This significant surge is primarily attributed to a shrinking supply, a consequence of slightly weakened demand and widespread avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million turkeys. Despite these rising wholesale costs, major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are strategically offering competitive deals, effectively pricing turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract budget-conscious customers. Experts anticipate that consumer prices will see a smaller increase than wholesale, as retailers prioritize keeping holiday meal costs manageable for families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans are expected to receive larger tax refunds next year, primarily due to new retroactive provisions in the Republican-led "one big, beautiful bill" act. An Oxford Economics analysis projects an additional $50 billion in taxpayer savings, either through increased refunds or reduced 2026 taxes. The legislation extended 2017 tax cuts and introduced new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and raising the SALT deduction cap. However, the IRS has not yet updated withholding tables, meaning many taxpayers will have overpaid, resulting in a "windfall" at tax time, disproportionately benefiting higher-income households.

          <p>An American missionary was kidnapped from his home in Niamey, Niger's capital, by three armed men, according to multiple security sources. The alarming abduction occurred just 100 yards from the presidential palace, where the ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since a 2023 coup. The U.S. Embassy subsequently issued a security alert, warning of a heightened risk of kidnapping throughout Niger and implementing new security measures for its personnel. The kidnapped American had worked for a U.S.-based charity since 2010, and his phone was tracked to an area known as a sanctuary for ISIS affiliates, indicating a severe and ongoing security threat in the region.</p>
