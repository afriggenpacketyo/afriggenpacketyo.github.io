          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 05:34:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American movie industry and the use of foreign incentives. This move has been criticized by industry unions, with UK media union Bectu warning that the tariffs could "deal a knock-out blow" to the industry as it recovers from the pandemic. The proposal raises questions about its scope, including whether it would apply to American production companies filming abroad and films on streaming services. The governments of Australia and New Zealand have voiced their support for their respective film industries in light of the proposed tariffs.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas, potentially including capturing and holding Gaza territory, which has prompted the call up of tens of thousands of reservists. The plan also involves a proposal to resume humanitarian aid deliveries through private companies after a two-month blockade. However, the UN and other aid agencies have criticized the plan, citing breaches of humanitarian principles. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has also criticized the government's plan, stating that it prioritizes territories over the return of hostages.</p>

          <p>Collections on federal student loans have restarted for over 5 million borrowers in default after a five-year pause, leading to potential financial instability for many. Borrowers face plan changes and long waits for assistance due to disruptions in the lending system and staff layoffs at the Education Department. Borrowers who are late on payments may see their credit scores decline significantly, impacting their ability to secure loans. The Student Borrower Protection Center warns that restarting collections amidst uncertainty will exacerbate economic challenges for working families.</p>

Neuroscientists explain that language learning reshapes neural pathways, improving memory, attention, and cognitive control. A German study on Syrian refugees found that brain activity changed as they became proficient in German. While multilingualism improves cognitive skills, it's unclear if it equates to higher intelligence. The article emphasizes that learning languages opens new cultural experiences, regardless of cognitive skill enhancements.</p>

          <p>Jack Goldsmith argues that the presidency has become too powerful, building on excesses of past administrations even before Trump's second term. He points out that Trump's actions, such as using emergency powers and disregarding statutory restrictions, echo those of predecessors like Nixon, Bush, Obama, and Biden. The author advocates for reforms, including judicial review and congressional action, to limit presidential authority and restore a balance of power.

The resulting antivenom, tested on mice, was protective against venom from black mambas, king cobras, and other dangerous snakes.

          <p>The Trump administration has shut down the office responsible for leading the 'Safe to Sleep' campaign, raising concerns about infant safety. This campaign, launched three decades ago, has significantly reduced sleep-related infant deaths by promoting safe sleep practices. After years of holding steady, sleep-related infant deaths have risen recently, possibly due to limited access to safe sleep information during the pandemic. Nonprofit organizations like First Candle will continue efforts to educate parents, but lack the resources to replace the NIH's contributions.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump confirmed that he had proposed to Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, that U.S. troops be allowed into Mexico to combat drug cartels, a suggestion that she rejected. Trump stated that he made the proposal because the cartels are "horrible people" and a threat to the U.S. He described the Mexican president as a "lovely woman" who is "so afraid of the cartels that she canâ€™t even think straight." The proposal has strained relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of the EU and against providing military support to Ukraine, won the first round of the Romanian presidential election rerun. Simion's strong support among the Romanian diaspora and his admiration for Donald Trump have raised concerns in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. His potential victory could impact Romania's role as a transit route for weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania, as the second round approaches.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house Americaâ€™s most ruthless offenders. He stated that the decision was motivated by the need to lock up dangerous criminals away from society. The plan faces challenges due to the prison's deteriorated infrastructure, high operating costs, and its current status as a national park and tourist site. The Bureau of Prisons stated that it will comply with all presidential orders, but did not address the feasibility of the project.</p>
