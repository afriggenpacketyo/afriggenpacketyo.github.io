          <p>Republican leadership in the House faced significant challenges Wednesday in securing enough votes for President Trump's major domestic policy package. Internal party divisions, with both moderates and conservative hardliners raising objections to the Senate-passed version, created a stalemate. House Speaker Mike Johnson engaged in extensive negotiations to win over dissenters, but with a razor-thin majority, the bill's passage remained uncertain. The situation was further complicated by travel disruptions due to storms, which affected member attendance for the crucial vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology PhD student accused in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students, has pleaded guilty to all charges. The plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty, and he is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences. During the hearing, Kohberger showed little emotion as he admitted to killing Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin. The decision has divided the victims' families, with some expressing relief at the closure while others condemned the prosecution for making a "deal with the devil."</p>

          <p>A federal jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, but acquitted him of the more severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. The verdict came after a high-profile trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends, including singer Cassie Ventura. While the acquittals on the top counts were a significant victory for the defense, Combs still faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of the two convictions.

          <p>This article outlines several potential fees associated with a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) that can increase the overall cost of borrowing. While HELOCs can be an attractive option due to rising home equity, borrowers should look beyond the advertised interest rate. Potential charges include upfront application and appraisal fees, which can cost several hundred dollars each, as well as ongoing annual maintenance or inactivity fees. Borrowers may also face significant closing costs similar to a mortgage and early termination penalties if the credit line is closed within a few years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a comprehensive legislative package combining tax cuts with major spending initiatives. The bill allocates significant funding to immigration control, including border wall construction, and boosts defense spending, while also incentivizing fossil fuel production and rolling back some climate initiatives. It proposes approximately $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses but also includes over $1 trillion in cuts to health programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially affecting millions of Americans and adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>The Trump administration has paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision the White House stated was made to prioritize "America's interests first." The move follows a Pentagon review of U.S. military support to all foreign countries, prompted by concerns that American military stockpiles were becoming too low. While officials did not specify which weapons systems were affected, the halt represents a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the ongoing war. The White House emphasized that the overall strength of the U.S. military remains unquestioned, citing recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as evidence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's plan to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, which cited an "invasion" as justification, unlawfully overstepped executive authority. The judge found that federal immigration law and the Constitution do not grant the president the power to unilaterally supplant the existing asylum process established by Congress.

The proposal comes as much of Europe is experiencing a record-breaking heat wave, underscoring the urgency of climate action. However, the plan is controversial due to a flexibility clause that would allow member states to use international carbon credits to offset a portion of their emissions.

          <p>This article offers an analysis of the legal aspects of the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, explaining why the jury reached its mixed verdict. It details the complexities of the racketeering (RICO) charge, which prosecutors failed to prove required a coordinated criminal enterprise, leading to his acquittal on that count. The convictions were for violating the Mann Act, a federal law against transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, based on testimony about organized sexual encounters. The piece breaks down the legal definitions and the evidence presented for each of the five counts Combs faced in the trial.</p>

          <p>The director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, Dr. Marwan Sultan, was killed along with several family members in an Israeli airstrike on his home, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military stated it had targeted a "key terrorist" from Hamas in the area and was reviewing claims of civilian harm. The hospital Dr. Sultan led had already been rendered non-functional due to previous damage. This strike occurred amid other attacks across Gaza, including one on the al-Mawasi "safe zone" that reportedly killed at least five people.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century to lead his team to a solid position of 310-5 at the close of day one of the second Test against England at Edgbaston.

England's bowlers fought hard on a flat pitch, with Chris Woakes taking two key wickets, but a late 99-run partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja ensured India ended the day in a strong position, looking to build a formidable first-innings total.</p>

The notoriously defensive and aggressive subspecies poses a threat to the state's native honeybee populations and public safety. The trapped swarm was euthanized, and officials have established a monitoring zone to detect any further presence.

          <p>Paramount Global is facing intense criticism from press freedom advocates after agreeing to a $16 million settlement to end President Trump's lawsuit against CBS News. The lawsuit stemmed from edits made to a "60 Minutes" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Critics, including the Reporters Without Borders, have labeled the decision a "shameful capitulation" that could embolden attacks on journalists and erode First Amendment protections. Paramount stated the money will cover Trump's legal fees and help fund his presidential library, but some senators have called for an investigation into whether the payment constitutes bribery to secure regulatory approval for a pending merger.</p>

          <p>A new mission is being launched to locate Amelia Earhart's aircraft, which vanished during her 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Researchers, organized by Purdue University, believe a 2015 satellite image may show a piece of her plane on Nikumaroro, a remote island in Kiribati. The expedition team plans to travel to the island in November to investigate the object, which they believe was exposed after a cyclone shifted sand on the atoll. The effort is fueled by what organizers call strong evidence suggesting Earhart and her navigator may have crash-landed there.</p>

In exchange, Vietnam has agreed to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. products, opening its markets to American goods.

First, savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is better, as current high rates on short-term options may outweigh the traditional advantage of long-term CDs. Second, one must assess their ability to keep a significant sum like $10,000 locked away without needing access to it, to avoid costly early withdrawal penalties. Finally, it is important to compare CDs to high-yield alternatives like savings or money market accounts, which offer comparable rates with more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
