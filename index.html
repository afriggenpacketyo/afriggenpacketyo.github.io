          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41, confirmed by her family. Giuffre had alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew and others when she was a minor, claims which Andrew has denied. Giuffre's family stated she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and trafficking, and that she was a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse. Her death is being investigated by local police, and is not considered suspicious.

          <p>Crystal Palace delivered a commanding performance against Aston Villa, winning 3-0, fueled by strong support from their fans. This victory is seen as a justification of manager Oliver Glasner's methods and the club's faith in him, especially after a challenging start to the season marked by key player departures. Glasner's success in winning the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022 sets a high standard, and leading Crystal Palace to their first major honor could surpass that achievement. The team's performance reflects the positive influence of Glasner and the players' dedication.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in American confidence in Donald Trump, even among some Republicans, regarding his performance on key issues. A majority of those surveyed described Trump's second term as "scary," and only a minority believe he is focused on the right priorities. The polls also show disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy, trade policies, and immigration. These negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting potential voter fatigue and concern over his policies.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least eight deaths and over 750 injuries. The blast, which blew out windows and damaged buildings up to 50km away, was initially attributed to a fire spreading to flammable materials. However, maritime risk firm Ambrey Intelligence suggests the explosion was due to improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Warnings about the safe storage of chemicals at the port had been previously issued, according to Iran's National Disaster Management Organisation.</p>

It also clarifies that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use.

          <p>The FBI's arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan, accused of helping a man evade immigration officers, has ignited a political firestorm. Republicans are calling for her removal, while Democrats decry the arrest as an overreach of executive power. The FBI director's public posting of Dugan's arrest has further polarized opinions, with Republicans emphasizing that "no one is above the law" and Democrats highlighting the Trump administration's disregard for judicial independence. The incident underscores the escalating tensions between the executive and judicial branches amid ongoing immigration debates.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett suggests that Apple's plan to shift iPhone assembly to India may not effectively reduce costs associated with tariffs. Moffett questions how moving assembly will alleviate tariff issues if components are still sourced from China. He contends that diversifying to India is not straightforward and that Apple's supply chain will likely face resistance. Moffett also notes that backlash against Apple in China and the lack of carrier support for tariff costs will negatively impact iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Terry Doughty wrote that the toddler, identified as VML, had been sent to Honduras on Friday, alongside her mother and sister, even as the court had sought to clarify the girl's status. Doughty set a hearing on the case for May 16 "in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process." The Department of Homeland Security defended its decision, stating that "The parents made the decision to take the child with them to Honduras."</p>
