          <p>Shares of the financial technology company Block surged after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, where it will replace Hess. This move is expected to drive significant demand for the stock, as passive index funds will need to purchase an estimated 101 million shares to align their holdings with the updated index. The inclusion comes as Block works to rebuild investor confidence following inconsistent performance from its Cash App business. The article notes that despite a recent strong market run, competing fintech firm Robinhood has not yet been added to the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hunter Biden Suggests Father's Poor Debate Performance Was Influenced by Ambien</h2>

          <p>In a new interview, Hunter Biden stated that his father, former President Joe Biden, was taking the prescription sleep aid Ambien before his debate against Donald Trump in June 2024. He suggested the medication contributed to a performance marked by stumbling answers and a weak voice, which intensified questions about his fitness for office. Shortly after the debate, Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race, and his campaign had previously attributed his hoarse voice to a cold. Hunter Biden's claim is the first time Ambien has been publicly linked to the event and may fuel a Republican-led House investigation into the former president's cognitive health.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed retrospective on the 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City, a case that transformed national awareness of missing children. It recounts the day he vanished walking to his school bus stop, the subsequent investigation, and the decades-long search for answers that haunted his family and law enforcement. The report examines early suspects, including Jose Ramos, and the emotional toll on the investigators and the Patz family. The case remained cold for over 30 years until a new district attorney and a crucial tip led authorities to a different suspect, fundamentally altering the direction of the investigation.</p>

          <p>For homeowners seeking a $20,000 loan, home equity products offer a potentially cheaper alternative to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. This article compares a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and a standard home equity loan, noting that their average interest rates are nearly identical at present. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change, while home equity loan rates are fixed, providing more predictability for borrowers. The analysis shows that while a HELOC is marginally cheaper now, even a small rate increase could make it more expensive over the life of the loan, urging caution for homeowners using their property as collateral.

          <p>A coalition of 25 countries, including the U.K., Canada, France, and Japan, has released a joint statement demanding an immediate end to the war in Gaza. The statement declares that civilian suffering has reached new depths and criticizes Israel's aid delivery model as dangerous and unacceptable under international humanitarian law. The call to action follows a recent incident where dozens of Palestinians were killed while seeking food aid. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the statement, asserting it is "disconnected from reality" and wrongly places pressure on Israel instead of Hamas, which it blames for prolonging the conflict by refusing a ceasefire deal.</p>

          <p>This article outlines three important factors for individuals considering placing a large sum, such as $20,000, into a short-term certificate of deposit (CD). It notes that short-term CDs currently offer higher rates than long-term ones, providing protection against market volatility amid concerns about inflation and economic policy. However, savers aiming for maximum interest over time might still earn more with a lower-rate, long-term CD due to the extended earning period. Finally, the article advises that the most competitive CD rates are often found at online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional local bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines why a reverse mortgage can be a particularly timely financial tool for senior homeowners aged 62 and older. It explains that a reverse mortgage allows seniors to receive payments from their home equity without the burden of immediate repayment, which is advantageous in the current high-interest-rate climate. These funds can supplement income, filling gaps left by Social Security or covering rising costs due to inflation. Furthermore, qualifying for a reverse mortgage may be easier than for other large loans, as it is based on home equity rather than stringent credit or income requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians to revert to their former team names, which were retired due to their offensive nature toward Native Americans. The president claims the change would honor Native American heritage, but the article suggests this is another instance of him using sports to energize his base and distract from other issues. While Trump has implied he could leverage a potential stadium deal to force the Commanders' hand, legal and political obstacles make this unlikely. The site of their potential new stadium in D.C. has already been transferred to the city government, limiting federal influence over the team's decisions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often using them to achieve goals typically associated with sanctions. Unlike sanctions, which often require international cooperation and can shut off markets, tariffs provide the president with unilateral control and generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury. The administration has deployed tariffs and the threat of them against China, Mexico, and even European allies to address issues ranging from trade deficits to immigration and drug trafficking. This approach, however, has created significant uncertainty in global markets and raises concerns about long-term economic and geopolitical stability.</p>

The sessions have attracted a regular following from across the country, with attendees finding comfort and connection in the shared experience. The article highlights this as part of a broader trend where individuals, particularly younger generations, are identifying as spiritual rather than religious, seeking community outside of traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that there will not be a vote on a resolution calling for the release of more files related to Jeffrey Epstein before Congress begins its August recess. Johnson said the administration needs "space to do what it is doing" and that further congressional action is not yet necessary. The announcement comes after the Justice Department formally requested a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the case. This delays a non-binding Republican resolution, which Democrats have called a "cover vote," and also stalls a separate bipartisan measure led by Rep. Thomas Massie that would compel the release of the files.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) ended the first half of 2025 with a substantial financial advantage, holding $80.7 million in cash on hand compared to the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) $15.2 million. This $65.6 million gap is significantly wider than at the same point before the 2018 midterm elections. The RNC's fundraising success is attributed to close collaboration with President Trump's team. While the DNC under new chair Ken Martin has improved its fundraising compared to the post-2016 cycle, the party still faces a major financial deficit as it prepares for the upcoming midterm elections and aims to counter Republican control in Washington.

          <p>The ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainty are negatively impacting smaller and secondary U.S. ports, from California to the Gulf Coast. While major hubs like the Port of Los Angeles have seen a temporary increase in traffic as shippers rush to import goods before tariff deadlines, smaller ports in Oakland, New Orleans, and Jacksonville are experiencing reduced container volumes. This market recalibration is causing economic strain on these ports and their local communities, which rely on trade for jobs and economic activity. The trend of ocean carriers skipping smaller ports in favor of larger ones is expected to continue, exacerbating the economic pain for these regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article details the three primary requirements for individuals looking to enroll in a debt management program to handle unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans. First, applicants must have a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated monthly payment. Second, the total amount of unsecured debt must fall within the program's limits, as these plans are not designed for very small or extremely large debt loads. Finally, a person must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which typically include closing the credit accounts in the plan and participating in financial counseling.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in 2017 for the 1979 murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, must receive a new trial or be released. The decision hinges on the finding that the trial judge gave the jury improper instructions regarding Hernandez's confession, which was obtained after hours of unwarned questioning. The court concluded that this error violated clearly established federal law and was not harmless, thus prejudicing the verdict. Hernandez, who has a history of mental illness and a low IQ, had his first trial end in a hung jury, and this ruling reopens one of New York's most infamous and haunting cold cases.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that President Trump is waging a multifront war on the American press that goes far beyond rhetoric. The article details a series of actions, including lawsuits against major news organizations, the defunding of public broadcasting, and the appointment of a loyalist to head the FCC, as part of a systematic effort to "demean, demonize, marginalize, and economically debilitate" independent reporting. It compares these tactics to those of authoritarian leaders and notes a lack of significant pushback from the public or many corporate media leaders. The piece concludes that while journalists continue to do their work, the sustained assault poses a grave threat to the Fourth Estate.</p>

          <p>California and a coalition of 19 other states are suing the Trump administration over new rules that bar undocumented immigrants from accessing several federally funded "public benefit" programs. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions, which affect programs like Head Start, emergency shelters, and food banks, are a cruel and abrupt reversal of decades-long precedent. The administration defends the rules as necessary to protect resources for American citizens and reduce incentives for illegal immigration. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta contends the policy unlawfully targets working mothers and children and will impose significant financial and administrative burdens on the states.</p>
