          <p>Meta reportedly approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI with a potential takeover offer before deciding to invest $14.3 billion into Scale AI. While the two companies engaged in talks, they did not finalize a deal, with sources suggesting the discussions were either "mutually dissolved" or Perplexity chose to walk away. This attempt highlights Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive efforts to strengthen the company's AI capabilities amid growing competition from OpenAI and Google's Alphabet. Zuckerberg is reportedly keen on hiring top AI talent and advancing Meta's position in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing applications. The failure to acquire Perplexity AI suggests Meta may need to explore alternative strategies to achieve its AI ambitions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention while his immigration proceedings continue. The judge determined that Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, is neither a flight risk nor a threat to the community, criticizing his detention as "highly unusual." Khalil's attorneys argued that the Department of Homeland Security was using immigration charges to punish him for anti-Israel speech, stemming from his leadership in student protests against Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. The White House has indicated it will appeal the decision. The judge also noted the lack of evidence to support the government's claims. Optimism surrounding Khalil's release is tempered by the administration's intent to appeal.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had given his wife a "bailout plan." After the shootings, Boelter's wife told investigators that her husband instructed her to leave their house, fearing armed individuals might appear. Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The Hoffmans recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer before the senator was shot, and his wife was shot while pushing the gunman out of the door.

          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with the oil and gas industry in a challenge to California's emission standards, reviving a lawsuit against the state's drive for electric vehicles. In a 7-2 decision, the justices ruled that fuel makers have standing to sue over California's strict emissions standards, arguing that the state and the EPA are misusing a 1970s rule to combat climate change. This decision comes as President Trump and congressional Republicans have also moved to block California's regulations on zero-emission vehicles. The ruling allows the lawsuit to proceed, potentially undermining California's efforts to reduce emissions and promote electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals that the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act could lead to higher monthly student loan payments for many borrowers. Under the proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), a borrower earning $80,000 annually could face a monthly payment of $467, significantly higher than the $187 under the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The Republican proposals would reduce the number of repayment plan choices and extend the repayment timeline to 30 years, potentially delaying major life milestones. Experts warn that higher payments could push more borrowers into default. (not investment advice)</p>

Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has asserted that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people" and that, in that sense, "all of Ukraine is ours," reviving a controversial narrative. He also stated he did not "rule out" the capture of the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy. Putin accused Ukrainian forces of shelling Russian border areas and claimed Russian troops had penetrated into Ukrainian territory to create a "buffer zone." Ukraine's Foreign Minister condemned Putin's statements as showing "disdain" for the peace process. The article emphasizes the ongoing conflict and Russia's territorial ambitions.</p>

          <p>California is challenging the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles after an appeals court granted Trump control of the National Guard troops. The state's attorneys are seeking a preliminary injunction to return control of the troops to Governor Gavin Newsom. The protests in LA were triggered by immigration raids, and Newsom argues the troops inflamed tensions and usurped local authority. Trump celebrated the appellate ruling and hinted at further deployments. The article suggests a continuing power struggle between the state and federal governments.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs. The companies argued that Trump lacked the authority to impose the tariffs without congressional approval. The ruling means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day window to file its response to the challenge. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously temporarily blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect. This decision slows down the legal process, delaying a final resolution on the legality of the tariffs.</p>
