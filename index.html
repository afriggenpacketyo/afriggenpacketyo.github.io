          <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration, along with other federal and local law enforcement agencies, arrested 114 undocumented immigrants at an underground nightclub in Colorado Springs. The operation, involving over 300 officers, also resulted in the seizure of firearms and drugs. DEA officials noted the presence of active-duty military personnel at the party, prompting an investigation by Army CID. The Colorado Springs Police Chief emphasized that their involvement was solely to address criminal violations, and the mayor stated that criminal activity would not be tolerated in the city.</p>

          <p>A federal judge sharply criticized the government's attempt to deport a Venezuelan couple legally residing in the U.S. based on alleged gang membership, ordering their release. Judge Briones accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support their claims that the couple were associated with a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and the couple had been granted Temporary Protected Status in 2024. The couple's attorneys expressed relief, stating that their clients faced life sentences in brutal prisons if deported. This case highlights ongoing legal battles regarding immigration enforcement and the evidence used to justify deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval rating is experiencing a dip as he nears 100 days in office, with polls revealing that a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the presidency. Surveys indicate his approval rating hovers between 39% and 45%, marking the lowest for a newly elected president at this point in their term in over seven decades. This shift reflects growing skepticism among Americans regarding his sweeping actions to transform the government. These ratings represent a notable change from the favorability uptick he experienced upon returning to the White House in January.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks found off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum confirmed the ships' identities through investigations of ship timbers, cargo bricks, and clay pipes. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, and the Christianus Quintus wrecked. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's role in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792 but did not abolish slavery until 1847.</p>

          <p>As volatility spikes in both the stock and bond markets, dividend stocks may become more appealing to investors seeking a balance between equity growth and yield. There are numerous dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with actively managed options offering the potential to identify higher-quality dividend payers. Investors looking to limit tech exposure can utilize dividend ETFs to gain exposure to tech companies' dividends without overweighting the sector. Macro themes of income and dividend payments are driving strong inflows into dividend ETFs, particularly in a volatile market where bonds face increased risk.</p>

          <p>Syria's Islamist leaders have rejected Kurdish demands for a decentralized system of government in a post-Assad political order, viewing it as a threat to national unity. This stance follows a meeting of rival Syrian Kurdish parties that agreed on a common political vision for the Kurdish minority, demanding respect for Kurdish national rights in a future Syrian constitution. The Syrian presidency also stated that recent statements by SDF leaders advocating a federal solution contradicted a previous deal with Damascus. Kurdish officials have expressed concerns about the Islamist leaders' approach to shaping the transition from Assad's rule.</p>

          <p>An Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport was partly caused by the crew's decision to use "visual separation," a common aviation practice. The crew requested and received permission to navigate around other aircraft visually rather than relying on air traffic control. This practice, while routine, can be risky if mishandled, as aviation experts have warned. The article explores how this decision, combined with other factors, contributed to the fatal accident.</p>
