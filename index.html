          <p>India's Reserve Bank kept its policy rate at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations, to evaluate previous rate cuts' economic impact. Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted moderated inflation but anticipated slower growth due to global trade uncertainties. The decision was unanimous, reflecting a patient approach given limited future rate cut room and ongoing trade-related headwinds, including new US tariffs. The RBI forecasts 6.8% GDP growth for fiscal year 2026, with average headline inflation revised to 2.6%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer proposes re-evaluating the interpretation of international laws, including Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in asylum cases. The aim is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers from blocking deportation based on claims of worse prison conditions or healthcare abroad. Starmer emphasized the need to adapt laws to current mass migration challenges, while still upholding asylum for those genuinely fleeing persecution. This initiative follows the Home Secretary's plans to tighten rules for indefinite leave to remain.</p>

The summit aims to bolster European defense capabilities, with discussions on a multi-layered "drone wall" to counter Russian incursions into EU airspace. Denmark and other European nations attribute the drone activity to a "professional actor," likely Russia, underscoring escalating security threats. Allies like the UK, US, and Germany are providing anti-drone support for the high-profile events.</p>

          <p>Danish club FC Midtjylland has pioneered a data-driven approach to set-pieces, making them a significant competitive advantage in football. Since 2014, the club has consistently scored at least 10 more goals from set-pieces than conceded, influencing tactical trends across Europe. Their innovative methods have led to a "pseudo-academy" of set-piece specialists now working at top clubs and national teams. This strategic focus, integrated into every training session, highlights a unique path to success for the club.</p>

          <p>A US government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve annual discretionary spending, impacting nonessential federal agencies and programs. Essential services like the Secret Service and active-duty military continue, but employees face delayed pay. Furloughed workers are guaranteed back pay, but contractors are not. Past shutdowns have led to significant work backlogs, lost revenue, and economic impacts, such as a $3 billion GDP reduction from the 2018-2019 shutdown. The duration of a shutdown largely determines its severity and long-term consequences.</p>

          <h2>US Government Shutdown Delays Pay for Active-Duty Military Personnel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US government shutdown means active-duty military personnel and deployed National Guard members will continue serving without pay until a funding deal is reached. Essential civilian Defense Department employees also work without immediate pay, while others are furloughed. Although back pay is guaranteed for federal employees, military pay requires separate legislation, as seen in 2013. Credit unions like Navy Federal and USAA are offering special loans to mitigate financial hardship for service members during this period.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown is unlikely to halt private mortgage processing, but it could cause delays for borrowers seeking government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, VA, and USDA. While the FHA and VA will largely continue to approve loans, furloughs may slow processing. The USDA, however, will halt new direct and guaranteed home loans. Additionally, those purchasing homes in flood zones might face delays in securing federally administered flood insurance, impacting thousands of Americans.</p>

          <p>Despite the US government shutdown, student loan borrowers are still required to make repayments, as these programs are funded through mandatory spending. However, most Education Department employees are furloughed, potentially making it difficult for borrowers to resolve issues or access assistance. While federal aid like Pell Grants and Direct Student Loans will continue, new grants and loan forgiveness applications could face delays if the shutdown persists. The FAFSA application process is expected to remain operational.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing skilled trades over traditional college paths, driven by high tuition costs and concerns about AI's impact on white-collar jobs. Many Gen Zers prioritize jobs that are difficult to automate, seeing security in professions like electricians and plumbers. This shift is challenging the historical stigma associated with trades, as young entrepreneurs find independence and significant earnings potential without accumulating student debt. The demand for skilled trades remains high, with some businesses noting increased interest in field roles over office positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a short US government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions. Essential FAA and TSA employees, including air traffic controllers and screeners, are required to work without pay. However, past shutdowns have seen increased sick calls and staff shortages, leading to longer security lines and potential flight delays. The US Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion weekly and exacerbate existing air traffic controller shortages. Train travel and passport services are expected to remain largely unaffected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US government's current shutdown adds to a history of 14 funding lapses since 1980, when legal opinions mandated agencies cease operations without approved funding. President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, while Bill Clinton and Donald Trump also experienced them, with Trump's 2018-2019 shutdown being the longest at 34 days. These impasses often stem from disagreements over spending, policy provisions, or deficit reduction. Shutdowns incur significant costs, including billions in lost GDP and back pay for furloughed federal workers.</p>

          <p>During a US government shutdown, members of Congress and the President continue to receive their salaries, as their pay is constitutionally mandated and funded by permanent appropriations. Most federal employees, however, whether essential or furloughed, face delayed paychecks until funding is restored. Unlike federal employees, contractors are not guaranteed back pay. Each congressional office determines which of its staffers are essential, though most are expected to keep their employees working without immediate compensation.</p>

          <p>The US government shutdown will not interrupt monthly Social Security payments for 74 million Americans, as these benefits are funded through mandatory spending.

Nearly 90% of SSA's workforce will remain on the job to ensure timely payments. The annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement, typically in October, might also face delays if Labor Department data releases are impacted.</p>

          <p>The US government shut down after midnight as Congress failed to pass critical funding bills, primarily due to a stalemate over extending enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. The Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies to initiate shutdown plans, leading to widespread federal service disruptions. Both Democrats and the Trump administration engaged in a blame game, with Democrats criticizing Trump's "erratic and unhinged" behavior. The shutdown is expected to furlough approximately 750,000 federal employees, incurring significant compensation costs.</p>

Opponents of Proposition 50 criticized the error as proof of a rushed process, further highlighting the already significant $284 million cost of the special election.
