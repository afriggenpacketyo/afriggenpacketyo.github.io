          <p>Panelists at a technology conference emphasized the importance for nations to develop their own "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and reflect local cultures and languages. They argued that relying on English-centric models from major tech companies is insufficient and that countries should take ownership of their AI systems. The experts suggested that open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services are key tools that can democratize the technology and empower emerging economies to build these custom capabilities.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has ordered the suspension of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties while it considers a case for her dismissal. The petition against her stems from a leaked phone conversation with a former Cambodian leader, which sparked public anger and accusations that she undermined the Thai military. This judicial action places her government in a precarious state and continues a pattern of political and legal challenges faced by the powerful Shinawatra family.</p>

          <p>Two tropical systems are impacting Mexico, with Tropical Storm Flossie intensifying into a hurricane off the country's southwestern coast. Forecasters expect Flossie to remain in open water but still bring heavy rainfall to several states, including Oaxaca and Jalisco. On Mexico's eastern coast, Tropical Depression Barry made landfall south of Tampico, also threatening to drench the region with several inches of rain, marking an active period for both the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons.</p>
