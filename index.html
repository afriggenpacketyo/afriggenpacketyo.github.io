            <p>Reports indicate that an Israeli strike impacted a hospital in Gaza City, with Hamas claiming significant damage to the intensive care and surgery departments. Initial reports from a local journalist suggested an evacuation warning was issued prior to the strike, however, no casualties have been confirmed. The hospital, Al-Ahli Baptist, is now the only functioning medical facility in Gaza City after the destruction of others. The Hamas-run government media office condemned the attack, while Israel stated it is investigating the incident. Optimism for this article is very low due to the strike.</p>

            <p>Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is rapidly increasing in India, transitioning from a former status symbol to a major health concern. A Lancet study predicts that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050. Abdominal obesity is linked to insulin resistance and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The issue is attributed to lifestyle changes, genetics, and historical adaptations to food scarcity, requiring revised guidelines for assessment and management. (not investment advice)</p>
