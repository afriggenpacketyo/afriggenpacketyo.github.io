        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss the end of their weekly dialogue, "The Conversation," after eight years. Joined by editor Aaron Retica, they answer reader questions about how they maintained civil conversations despite political differences. They reflect on the transformation of the Republican Party and the degradation of public discourse, attributing some of it to the social media revolution. Collins and Stephens emphasize the importance of humor and approaching conversations with a willingness to understand the other side's perspective, rather than aiming to "win" the argument.</p>

          <p>The selection of jurors is set to begin in the federal trial of Sean Combs, accused of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Prosecutors allege that Combs ran a criminal enterprise, using his employees to facilitate sexual exploitation and other crimes over two decades. The government intends to prove that Combs's staff helped enable crimes, including arson, kidnapping, forced labor, bribery, obstruction of justice, and drug violations. Combs's defense argues that the sexual encounters were consensual and that the government is unfairly portraying his entire life as a criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy received praise for his handling of an antisemitic incident at one of the company's bars in Philadelphia. After initially expressing anger and a desire to "ruin" those responsible for an antisemitic sign, Portnoy decided to use the incident as a "teaching moment." He is sending the individuals involved to Auschwitz in Poland to learn about the Holocaust. Portnoy also fired two waitresses involved in the incident.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a dip after Warren Buffett announced his retirement, effective January 1, 2026, with Greg Abel succeeding him as CEO. The board voted unanimously on the decision for Abel to take over, while Buffett will remain as chairman. The news marks the end of Buffett's 60-year run leading the company, which has grown from a failing textile mill into a juggernaut worth nearly $1.2 trillion. Despite the initial market reaction, some analysts view this as a transparent transition and are confident in Buffett's continued mentorship.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the expansion of presidential power, arguing that Donald Trump's actions build upon excesses of recent presidencies. The author, Jack Goldsmith, points out that Trump's use of emergency powers and claims of national security authority echo moves made by Richard Nixon and the George W. Bush administration. The article also notes that Barack Obama and Joe Biden also expanded presidential power through executive orders and non-enforcement of laws. Goldsmith calls for reforms to limit presidential power and restore Congress's role in policymaking.</p>

          <p>Midwives in Chad are expressing concern over the cancellation of USAID contracts, which threatens their jobs and the maternal health services they provide to vulnerable women, including Sudanese refugees. The funding cuts come as Chad faces one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. The midwives, who work for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), provide critical life-saving care, particularly in remote areas. The loss of U.S. funding will force the program to prioritize services, potentially leading to more women dying in childbirth.</p>

          <p>This article in The Atlantic critiques a narrow, traditional definition of family in pronatalist policies, arguing that it excludes many Americans and is strategically unsound. It proposes embracing diverse family structures and lowering barriers to parenthood for all, including single individuals and those struggling with fertility or childcare costs. The author highlights research showing that the quality of relationships and community acceptance are more influential for children's well-being than household arrangements. The article suggests policy options such as subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies, expanding family-leave policies, and encouraging co-parenting among friends.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries.

The move has been met with criticism, with concerns raised about the impact on the industry and potential retaliatory measures from other countries. It is unclear whether the tariffs would apply to American production companies producing films abroad.</p>
