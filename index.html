          <p>Samsung has announced a major $16.5 billion chip supply deal with an undisclosed partner, providing a significant boost to its foundry business. The contract, effective from July 2024 to the end of 2033, has sparked speculation about the client, with analysts suggesting Qualcomm or Tesla as possibilities. This long-term agreement is a critical development for Samsung's 2-nanometer chip production, although the company's recent earnings forecasts have been weak due to struggles in capturing AI-related demand compared to competitors.

          <p>Black Sabbath's bassist, Geezer Butler, shared a poignant remembrance of Ozzy Osbourne's final concert, which took place just weeks before the rock legend's death at 76. Butler described being shocked by Osbourne's frailty, noting he needed assistance and performed while seated on a throne. The show, a tribute featuring numerous rock icons, was an emotional farewell for the "Prince of Darkness," with Butler expressing gratitude for the chance to play together one last time in front of his fans.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, which the union has labeled "grotesque" compared to offers for other public sector workers. A consultative vote is anticipated to show strong opposition and a high turnout, setting the stage for a formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government does not re-enter negotiations. This development follows a similar rejection by the GMB union, amplifying pressure on the health secretary amid ongoing industrial action by resident doctors.</p>

          <p>Top medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, are voicing "deep concern" over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel provides crucial, evidence-based guidelines for primary care, such as cancer screenings and managing chronic diseases, which also influence insurance coverage. The potential move follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, fueling fears that political interference could undermine a trusted source of medical guidance.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid concerns over imported pets. An investigation found that thousands of dogs are brought into the country from places like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, leading to issues with infectious diseases like Brucella canis and severe behavioral problems. Owners have reported receiving aggressive or sick animals, described by one expert as a "ticking time bomb." The charity warns this unregulated system poses a risk to both animal welfare and public health.</p>

          <h2>Israel Announces Daily 'Tactical Pause' in Parts of Gaza to Facilitate Aid</h2>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter and be distributed amid a worsening hunger crisis. The pause affects populated areas like Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, providing secure land routes for the UN and other agencies. The move comes after stark warnings of famine and images of malnourished children drew global criticism. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the full scale of the catastrophe.</p>

          <h2>Google Admits Early Warning System Failed to Adequately Alert Millions During 2023 Turkey Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 19:16:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to work as intended during the deadly 2023 earthquake in Turkey, underestimating the quake's magnitude. Consequently, only 469 high-level "Take Action" warnings were sent, while ten million people in the highest-risk zone could have received one, potentially providing up to 35 seconds of warning. The system's failure to trigger the loud, overriding alarm for the 7.8 magnitude tremor highlights limitations in the technology, which Google says it is now working to improve.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharply witty musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. Famous in the 1950s and '60s for his piano-led songs that cleverly skewered politics, nuclear war, and social mores, Lehrer was a Harvard-educated mathematician who largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on teaching. His work, including songs like "The Vatican Rag" and "Pollution," had a profound impact on generations of comedy songwriters, who admired his ability to tackle serious subjects with biting humor.</p>

The officers, who have since been recognized for their bravery, spoke about the profound and lasting impact of the horrific event on themselves and the united response from the community.</p>

          <p>The Keeladi archaeological site in Tamil Nadu, India, has ignited a fierce debate over the origins of civilization in the subcontinent, becoming a symbol of regional pride and political tension. Artifacts discovered there, estimated to be up to 2,500 years old, suggest the existence of a literate, urban society in southern India that may be as old as those in the Gangetic plains. These findings challenge the long-held narrative of northern cultural dominance and have fueled a political battle between state and federal governments over historical interpretation.</p>

          <p>Human rights organizations in Argentina dedicated to investigating the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship are facing mass layoffs and defunding under President Javier Milei's austerity measures. Key institutions located at the former ESMA detention center have seen their staff cut significantly, jeopardizing efforts to document atrocities and find children stolen at birth. This policy shift has sparked protests from activists and survivors who fear that the country's progress on "Truth, Memory and Justice" is being deliberately undermined.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." By analyzing the plane's flight logs, found in the U.S., they were able to prove its use in the 1977 disappearance of a group of activists and nuns, providing crucial evidence for a landmark human rights trial. The plane has now been returned to Argentina and is displayed at the former ESMA detention center, serving as a tangible witness to state-sponsored terror.</p>

          <p>Three years after the X-Press Pearl cargo ship disaster off the coast of Sri Lanka, the environmental impact continues to worsen. Billions of plastic pellets, or "nurdles," that spilled into the ocean have become more toxic over time, acting like "chemical sponges" that absorb pollutants and harm marine life. Fishermen report devastated fish stocks, and tests on local fish have found hazardous metals, raising concerns for human health. The ship's owner and the Sri Lankan government remain in a legal battle over compensation for the long-term damage.</p>
