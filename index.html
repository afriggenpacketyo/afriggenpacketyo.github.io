          <p>Shares of the luxury automaker Ferrari suffered their worst single-day trading loss in history following the release of a disappointing financial forecast. The company's updated guidance for the full year and its long-term 2030 outlook fell short of analyst expectations. A significant factor in the negative market reaction was Ferrari's decision to scale back its ambitions for electric vehicle production, reducing its 2030 EV sales target from 40% to just 20% of its total lineup.

In a speech at the party's annual conference, he positioned Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, promising "new energy and new ideas." The strategy aims to present the party as the primary alternative to both Labour, which has governed Wales since 1999, and the rising Reform UK party, in an effort to attract a broader base of voters.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, that will prohibit streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video from playing commercials at a volume significantly louder than the show being watched. The legislation closes a loophole in the 2010 federal CALM Act, which only applied to broadcast and cable television. Since California is such a large market, the new rule is expected to compel streaming platforms to adopt this standard nationwide, ending the practice of jarringly loud ads.</p>
