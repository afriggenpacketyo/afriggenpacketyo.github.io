          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay increase, deemed "derisory" by the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMA argues the increase is insufficient to reverse years of pay freezes, and that doctors' pay remains significantly lower than 16 years ago after adjusting for inflation.  The BMA will ballot members next week on potential strike action.  The Department of Health defends the offer as being above inflation.</p>
