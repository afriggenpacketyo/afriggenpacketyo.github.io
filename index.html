          <p>Owen Lawrence, the 38-year-old suspect in a crossbow attack that injured two women in Leeds, has died from a self-inflicted injury. The incident occurred during the popular Otley Run pub crawl in Headingley, leading to road closures and cordons. Counter Terrorism Policing North East believes Lawrence acted alone and is not seeking other suspects. The two women, aged 19 and 31, were hospitalized, with one later discharged after receiving treatment for their injuries.</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced an expansion of its cost-cutting program, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the end of 2027, primarily in selling, informational, and administrative expenses. This initiative aims to offset declining sales, largely due to reduced revenue from its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid. The company expects these savings to be driven by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and artificial intelligence, and streamlining business processes. Pfizer reported first-quarter profits that exceeded estimates, despite the sales decrease, signaling the cost-cutting measures are beginning to yield positive results.</p>

Zelensky stated Ukraine had already agreed to an unconditional 30-day cease-fire, which Russia rejected, and called for an immediate, full, and unconditional cease-fire for at least 30 days.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a high number of executive orders and memorandums in his first 100 days, declaring national emergencies and engaging in clashes with the courts. Experts argue this represents an unprecedented overreach of executive power, driven by a legal theory granting the president nearly unquestioned control over the federal government. Trump's actions include purging independent agencies, targeting specific law firms, and invoking emergency powers to impose tariffs. While facing pushback from the courts, Trump has largely avoided challenges from Congress, raising concerns about the breakdown of checks and balances.</p>

          <h2>The Pitfalls of One-Size-Fits-All Fitness Trends</h2>

          <p>The current fitness landscape is increasingly dominated by a "bro-y" approach, emphasizing performance and universal goals, often promoted by online influencers. This trend overlooks the individual nature of exercise and can lead to unrealistic expectations and body negativity. Experts caution against following generic fitness advice and stress the importance of tailoring routines to personal needs and circumstances. The focus on strict routines and performance metrics can also exacerbate existing inequalities, as women often face different expectations and responsibilities that limit their ability to prioritize self-focused wellness practices.</p>

          <p>A large fire at an electricity substation in north-west London led to the evacuation of a nearby block of flats, with approximately 80 residents safely evacuated. The fire, which broke out early in the morning, caused the roof of the building on Aberdeen Place to catch alight, prompting a response from over 100 firefighters. While no injuries were reported, local residents were advised to keep their doors and windows closed, and UK Power Networks attributed the fire to a fault in the substation equipment. The substation remained operational, and electricity supply was not interrupted.</p>

The Spanish electricity system shut down after two separate power outages occurred in southwestern Spain within a short time frame.

The Port of Los Angeles has seen a 10% decrease in shipments, with predictions of a 35% drop in arrivals within two weeks.
