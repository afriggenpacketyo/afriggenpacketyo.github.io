          <p>At least 59 Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Saturday, with 31 shot dead while trying to access an aid distribution site near Rafah. The Red Cross reported a massive influx of casualties with gunshot wounds, while Israel's military stated it fired warning shots at suspicious individuals. In separate incidents, Israeli airstrikes killed 28 others, including four children, in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. These events occurred amid stalled ceasefire talks and growing concerns over famine, as much of Gaza's population relies on restricted humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Declassified documents reveal a US military F-16 jet was struck by an unknown object over Arizona in January 2023, intensifying discussions about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) in American airspace. While authorities concluded the object was a drone, its operator remains unknown, and the incident is one of hundreds reported by the Department of Defense. Experts like filmmaker James Fox note a long history of sightings involving craft with advanced capabilities, such as lacking visible propulsion or heat signatures. The incident has prompted further investigation and public debate about the nature of these objects.</p>

          <h2>One Year After Assassination Attempt, Trump's Survival Continues to Shape US Politics</h2>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, the event's impact continues to resonate through American politics. Donald Trump's survival, which he and his supporters attribute to divine intervention, has fueled a zealous self-belief that defines his presidency. The incident also starkly contrasted with then-President Joe Biden's perceived weakness, contributing to his decision to drop out of the election race just eight days later. The article reflects on how the shooting solidified Trump's image as a resilient fighter for his base and exacerbated deep divisions within the Democratic party, which is still grappling with the fallout.</p>

          <p>Tensions between China and India have flared up over the issue of the 14th Dalai Lama's succession, potentially straining their recently improving relationship. The dispute was ignited by an Indian minister's comment that only the Dalai Lama and his institution can identify his successor, followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader. Beijing responded with formal protests, insisting that the succession must follow Chinese law and tradition, and viewing the Dalai Lama as an anti-China separatist. While some observers warn that Tibet is a "red line" for China, others believe the fragile diplomatic thaw will likely survive.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech are creating "cyborg jellyfish" by embedding microelectric controllers into the animals, allowing them to be remotely guided for ocean exploration. This innovative approach aims to collect environmental data at a significantly lower cost than traditional underwater robots, potentially democratizing ocean research. The jellyfish are ideal subjects as they lack a central nervous system, have no pain receptors, and possess remarkable regenerative abilities. Researchers are now working to enhance the devices for deep-sea pressures and to enable horizontal steering, hoping to deploy swarms of these biohybrid robots to uncover oceanic mysteries.</p>

          <p>An opinion article uses the release of a new "Superman" movie to question the whereabouts of real-life heroes in American society, particularly in politics. The author argues that the concept of a hero, once defined by significant public contribution and sacrifice, has been replaced by a culture of celebrity and fame driven by money. The piece heavily criticizes several Republican politicians for their votes on the "Big Beautiful Bill," accusing them of cowardice and abandoning their stated principles for political expediency. It concludes by suggesting that while a superhero isn't needed, the country desperately requires leaders with integrity.</p>

          <p>The class of 2025 is encountering a highly challenging job market, with many recent college graduates struggling to find employment or settling for lower-paying positions. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York note that cautious hiring by employers, coupled with job cuts in government and tech sectors, has limited opportunities. This has created a fierce "employers' market," forcing graduates to be more flexible and accept jobs outside their envisioned career paths. Despite the immediate difficulties, experts suggest that a college degree remains a valuable long-term investment, with most graduates finding more suitable work within a few years.</p>

Since June, 17 children have reportedly been treated at Alder Hey for measles, a spike that officials attribute to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake.

Other methods involve traveling off-peak, finding "kids go free" offers, using home-swapping websites to avoid accommodation costs, and collecting credit card loyalty points for flights.

In her statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi asserted that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice" and did not deserve the potential prison sentence he was facing, leading to the case's dismissal.</p>

          <p>Activists and politicians in the UK are calling for cosmetic and skincare ingredient lists to be in English rather than Latin to better protect consumers with allergies. The current system uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based scientific names that are difficult for most people to understand. Campaigners, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue this puts people at risk, sharing stories of allergic reactions caused by unrecognized ingredients. While the industry defends the Latin system for providing global harmonization, critics insist that clear, plain-language labeling is necessary for consumer safety.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé has undergone a remarkable transformation at Paris Saint-Germain, earning praise from coach Luis Enrique as the season's best player. Previously known for his explosive talent but inconsistent application, Dembélé has thrived in a more central role, becoming a leader through his relentless pressing and defensive work rate, not just his goals. This new-found discipline and collective contribution have been pivotal to PSG's success, forcing mistakes from top opponents and setting the tone for the team's aggressive style. The 28-year-old's evolution from a late-blooming talent into a complete player has been a key factor in the team's dominant season.</p>

Seiden was found beaten to death after staying in the motel with her partners, Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. The investigation revealed a history of jealousy, physical abuse, and threats within the trio, particularly after Seiden expressed a desire to leave. Araujo ultimately took a plea deal for second-degree murder and testified against Abell, claiming he was the primary aggressor.

          <p>Kindergartens across China are grappling with a severe economic crisis due to the country's plunging birth rate, leading to a sharp decline in student enrollment. From a peak of 48.18 million in 2020, the number of children in kindergartens dropped by over 25% to 35.84 million last year, forcing over 38,000 institutions to close. Even historically exclusive, government-affiliated kindergartens are now forced to recruit from the general public to survive. This trend highlights the profound demographic and economic challenges China faces as it contends with a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce.</p>

          <p>Audio from a neighbor's security camera proved crucial in the murder trial of Melissa Turner, who was accused of killing her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, at their Florida home. While Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense after he strangled her, the surveillance footage captured audio of a woman screaming phrases like "So f****** die." Investigators also used an in-home ADT camera that showed Turner following an unarmed Trussler in anger. Prosecutors argued this evidence contradicted her self-defense claim, and a jury ultimately found her guilty of second-degree murder, sentencing her to over 20 years in prison.</p>

The author contends that a Ukrainian collapse would have daunting consequences for European security and international law.
