          <p>This article explains President Trump's sweeping tariff program, detailing how these taxes on imported goods aim to boost American manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit. While Trump argues for their economic benefits, critics point to increased prices for US consumers and global economic volatility. The article outlines specific tariffs on goods like steel and cars, as well as duties applied to various countries, and highlights ongoing trade negotiations and legal challenges to the president's authority. The International Monetary Fund and OECD have downgraded global economic growth predictions due to these policies, which also contribute to US inflation.</p>

The incident has deeply affected the community and the policing family, raising questions about how authorities address extremist views, as Freeman previously identified as a "sovereign citizen" and displayed anti-authority sentiments online.</p>

          <p>Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has summoned the senior US diplomat in Copenhagen following reports that US citizens linked to the Trump administration conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. Public broadcaster DR reported at least three individuals were involved, with one allegedly compiling lists of Greenlanders' views on US control. Copenhagen views such activities as an attack on national sovereignty, asserting Denmark will not tolerate covert operations on its territory. The US has expressed interest in Greenland for its mineral wealth and strategic Arctic location, with Trump previously suggesting a US takeover, which raises concerns about Greenlandic democracy.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this article explores the lasting trauma experienced by its youngest survivors, now adults. Many children were displaced, separated from families, and faced unsanitary conditions, leading to persistent mental health issues. Filmmaker E'jaaz Mason, a survivor himself, documented these experiences in 'Katrina Babies,' highlighting the disruption of community bonds and the struggles with PTSD. The article also notes that while New Orleans has upgraded its flood defenses, it remains vulnerable due to coastal erosion and climate change, with concerns raised about potential cuts to federal disaster agencies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to discuss a new draft law on military service, primarily focusing on voluntary recruitment for the Bundeswehr to address a significant shortfall. This comes as an anti-war alliance, "Rheinmetall Entwaffen," protested outside an armed forces careers center in Cologne. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius aims to meet NATO's requirement for 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists. While the initial focus is on voluntary service, the reintroduction of compulsory military service, suspended in 2011, remains an option if recruitment targets are not met. Chancellor Friedrich Merz indicates consensus among coalition partners on the objective.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, labeling them "incompetent" for their handling of Chicago's crime surge, following a weekend with six deaths and 27 injuries. Trump urged Pritzker to call him for assistance, reiterating his proposal to deploy the National Guard, a suggestion strongly opposed by the Democratic leaders. Pritzker and Johnson insist the city does not need military occupation, advocating for a holistic approach to community safety. While overall crime is down from last year, it has increased by 40% since 2021, with Chicago frequently named the "nation's homicide capital."</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their energy bills rise by 2% in October, as energy regulator Ofgem announces an increase to the price cap. This means a typical household will pay £1,755 a year, an increase of £35, signaling another winter of relatively high energy costs. The rise is attributed to higher wholesale energy prices, increased transportation costs, and new government support measures for consumers. Campaigners express concern over the financial strain on families already grappling with rising food prices and significant energy debt. Consumers are advised to consider fixed-price deals, though exit fees should be noted.</p>

He hopes his public announcement will foster a safer and more inclusive environment for others. Brown described a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, recalling homophobic comments and a teammate's discomfort with gay players.

          <p>China's embattled property market is showing signs of a tentative recovery, with major developers like China Resources Land and Sunac posting improved interim results. State-owned CR Land's net profit rose 16.2%, driven by property development and retail consumption, while privately owned Sunac narrowed its loss by 14.4% due to lower operating costs. These results indicate that government stimulus measures and recovering retail consumption are beginning to stabilize the industry after a period of significant debt and tepid sales. The improved performance, particularly in shopping centers, suggests a positive shift from the crisis mode experienced by many developers just a year ago. (not investment advice)</p>

The pilot's attempts to fix the issue, including "touch and go" landings, led the jet's computer to mistakenly enter "ground-operation mode," making it uncontrollable. The pilot ejected safely. The report highlighted that prior maintenance guidance on cold weather issues was not referenced during the call, contributing to the decision-making that led to the crash.</p>

Curator Peter Pentz suggests it could represent King Harald Bluetooth. Found in Norway in 1796, the piece was rediscovered in the museum's archives. Its unique attention to individual detail and smiling expression stands in stark contrast to other, simpler Viking Age human depictions, which are rare compared to animal motifs.</p>

Despite initial promise, Hamilton has struggled for competitiveness, often out-qualified by teammate Charles Leclerc. The article highlights his difficulty adapting to the current generation of ground-effect cars, which require a different driving style than his previous flat-floor cars. While acknowledging his exceptional career, experts suggest that the brain's slower rate of building new synapses with age could make adapting to unfamiliar car characteristics more difficult, impacting his confidence and natural speed.

Profits in the first seven months fell 1.7%, primarily due to the mining sector, while manufacturing and utilities saw gains. Statistician Yu Weining attributed the recovery to policies aimed at restoring consumer price levels. Analysts suggest the anti-involution campaign, though incremental, demonstrates government responsiveness to business concerns, but deflationary pressures may persist until industry consolidation occurs.

          <p>Britain's Jacob Fearnley secured his first US Open main-draw victory, battling nerves and a heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a four-set match. The 24-year-old Scot struggled with his service game, producing 16 double faults in high-tension moments, but found his rhythm in the final set. Fearnley's rapid ascent in rankings over the past 15 months has quickly brought him to major tournaments, where he often faces high-profile opponents. He is now set for a second-round rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev, hoping that continued exposure to high-stakes environments will help him manage his service issues. The match score was 7-5 6-2 5-7 6-4.</p>

          <p>India's substantial merchandise exports to the U.S. face a significant threat as President Trump's additional 25% tariffs, totaling 50% on Indian shipments, take effect. This move, linked to India's Russian oil purchases, risks diminishing India's appeal as a manufacturing hub and could reduce its GDP growth by 0.6 to 1 percentage point. The U.S. is India's largest export partner, receiving nearly 20% of its goods, including engineering products, gems, jewelry, textiles, and electronics. While some sectors like pharmaceuticals currently have exemptions, Trump has threatened future duties, leaving India's export-reliant industries highly vulnerable. (not investment advice)</p>

Leaders such as Brazil's Lula and China's Xi Jinping advocate for unity against unilateralism and protectionism, with Lula emphasizing diversification away from the dollar. Trump's use of tariffs to exert political will on non-trade issues is seen as an infringement on national sovereignty, pushing traditionally US-friendly nations to seek new partners and strengthen blocs like BRICS.
