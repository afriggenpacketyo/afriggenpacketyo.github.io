          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. The proposed deal reportedly involves territorial swaps, a condition Ukraine has consistently rejected since the 2022 invasion. This development follows a meeting between a U.S. special envoy and Putin, where Russia indicated a willingness to halt the war if Kyiv withdrew forces from the Donbas region. European officials remain skeptical, viewing the summit as a diplomatic victory for Russia that could decide Ukraine's future without its full participation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Protests are increasing across the UK against the government's use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers, fueled by local safety concerns and online organizing. In Epping, Essex, a protest was sparked after a hotel resident was charged with sexual assault, though he has denied the offenses. While some activists see far-right influence, many protestors are local residents, including mothers and professionals, who express frustration over a lack of transparency from the Home Office. The government's policy, which costs over £5.7 million daily, faces criticism for creating community tensions and for the lack of detailed information about the asylum seekers being housed.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," presents a deeply unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew, likely cementing his removal from public life. The book details his arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, supported by hundreds of interviews. It chronicles numerous scandals involving money and sex, alongside anecdotes of his rudeness and a profound lack of self-awareness. While touching on his authentic courage during the Falklands War, the biography largely portrays a lonely and insecure figure whose actions have become a persistent liability for the monarchy.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood established a significant four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended the second round. After an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par, with his only blemish being a bogey on the 18th hole. His strong performance positions him well for a potential first-ever PGA Tour victory. American Collin Morikawa and others are tied for second at nine under, while 21 players, including Justin Rose, were still on the course when lightning forced the suspension of play in the FedExCup playoff event.</p>

          <p>Rapper Busta Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr., is refuting a lawsuit filed by a former assistant, calling the claims an "attempted shake-down." The ex-assistant, Dashiel Gables, alleges wage violations, assault, battery, and emotional distress, claiming he was underpaid and subjected to slurs. The lawsuit states Gables was required to work long hours for a flat daily rate and was physically assaulted by the rapper on his last day of employment. Rhymes has categorically denied the allegations, stating Gables was let go after a brief period and is now manufacturing claims, and has announced plans for a countersuit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is weighing a request from the Trump administration to end the Flores agreement, a long-standing policy that sets standards for the treatment of immigrant children in U.S. custody. The administration argues the policy hinders its immigration enforcement, while advocates warn that conditions for children are already deteriorating, citing prolonged detention times and poor sanitation. During a hearing, Judge Dolly Gee expressed skepticism, questioning why conditions were worsening despite record-low border arrests. Child advocates submitted accounts of neglect and are pushing for the protections to remain and for independent monitoring to be expanded, highlighting the traumatic experiences of detained children.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's head coach, Eddie Howe, has stated that he "can't involve" forward Alexander Isak with the first team at present. This decision follows the club's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool after the Swedish international expressed a desire to explore other options. Isak, who missed the pre-season tour with a minor injury, has been training alone and at different times from his teammates, though Howe confirmed it is not a disciplinary action.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore allowing 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. This move aims to "democratize" investing but introduces assets with higher risk profiles and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While these investments offer the potential for greater returns, they also come with higher fees and volatility, which could pose a risk to retirement savers. Experts believe adoption by employers will be slow due to concerns about cost, complexity, and fiduciary responsibilities under existing retirement laws. (not investment advice)</p>

Through archival footage and interviews with his mother, former bandmates, and romantic partners, the documentary paints a picture of a turbulent but gifted individual. It thoughtfully handles the circumstances of his death, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide, and successfully dimensionalizes the artist behind the iconic album "Grace."</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve an occupation of Gaza City is being driven by his reliance on hard-right coalition partners, despite opposition from the Israeli public and military establishment. These far-right parties advocate for the annexation and resettlement of Gaza, a goal most Israelis do not support. The military views a deeper occupation as a strategic trap that will drain resources and endanger soldiers and hostages. President Trump's rhetoric has emboldened these hard-right factions, and without stronger international pressure, Netanyahu is likely to continue pursuing policies that serve his narrow political base rather than Israel's broader strategic interests.</p>

The 2-1 decision vacates U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's finding that officials willfully disregarded his order to halt the removals under the Alien Enemies Act. The majority opinion argued that the lower court's order raised "troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions."

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico, following reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. Sheinbaum stated, "There will be no invasion," emphasizing that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security issues, its sovereignty is inalienable. The reports have stoked nationalist fears in Mexico, where many view the U.S. designation of cartels as terrorist organizations as a potential prelude to unilateral military action. Sheinbaum confirmed she had previously rebuffed a U.S. offer of direct military assistance, insisting on collaboration without the presence of foreign troops.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Donald Trump, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. During the meeting, Trump stated that Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips due to its increased investment in the U.S., easing investor fears about potential impacts on profitability. This positive news comes shortly after Apple reported strong quarterly earnings, with significant growth in both overall revenue and iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is launching another investigation into the origins of the probe concerning Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized the new inquiry, following the recent declassification of documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard accused the Obama administration of knowingly promoting a false narrative about Russian interference to undermine Trump's campaign. Despite numerous previous investigations into the matter, this new effort appears aimed at reaching a different conclusion and re-examining the conduct of past officials, continuing a long-standing political battle.</p>

Players and coaches have voiced their frustration, highlighting the sexualization of female athletes and the distraction from the game. Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham expressed concern that a player could get hurt, undermining efforts to have the league taken seriously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering some relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with declines of nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to see rising prices and limited supply, with cities like Milwaukee experiencing a 26% price increase since 2022, creating a divided national housing landscape.

          <p>A former Los Angeles police officer, Eric Halem, has been arrested in connection with a series of home burglaries in the San Fernando Valley, an area he previously patrolled. Halem was taken into custody by the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division and is suspected of links to home invasions in affluent neighborhoods like Encino. He resigned from the LAPD in 2022 but remained a reserve officer until March of this year, when he was charged in a separate insurance fraud case involving a luxury car. The arrest raises serious concerns about a breach of public trust by a former law enforcement officer.</p>
