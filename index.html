          <h2>LA Zoo to Relocate Remaining Elephants Amid Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo will pause its elephant program, relocating its last two elephants, Billy and Tina, to the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma. This decision follows decades of criticism from animal rights advocates regarding the small enclosure size and the history of health issues and deaths among the elephants. Celebrities and city council members have previously advocated for Billy's relocation to a sanctuary due to concerns about his mental and physical health, citing his repetitive bobbing behavior. The zoo maintains it provides quality care and that the move is due to the infeasibility of creating a larger social herd at the L.A. Zoo, while animal welfare organizations express mixed feelings, preferring a sanctuary for the elephants. The optimism score is 40 because the elephants are going to a better place but are still in captivity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China faces a nationwide decline in birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, is experiencing a contrasting trend due to strong cultural traditions that value larger families and ancestral lineage. The province recorded 1.13 million births in 2024, marking a year-on-year increase of 100,000 and making it the leading province for new births in China for the seventh consecutive year. In Chaoshan, the idea that more children bring more blessings and that sons carry on the family name remains deeply ingrained, contributing to the region's higher birth rate compared to the rest of the country. Guangdong's birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people is among the highest in China.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The agencies aim to remove petroleum-based dyes from food and medications, citing studies linking them to health conditions like ADHD and cancer, though scientists caution the evidence is not definitive. The FDA is requesting food companies to speed up the removal of Red No. 3 and plans to revoke authorization for Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B. The plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies, and the FDA intends to work with the industry to transition to natural alternatives. The optimism score is 60 because there is no guarantee that the plan will work.</p>

          <p>Recent newspaper headlines focus on potential Ukraine peace talks, with reports suggesting a controversial proposal that would allow Russia to retain seized territory. Donald Trump's tariffs are also a significant concern, with the IMF delivering a negative verdict on their impact on the world economy, leading to cuts in growth forecasts. Additionally, the death of Pope Francis continues to be a prominent story, with images of his body laid in state appearing on several front pages.

          <p>China has urged Japan to coordinate action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, as trade tensions escalate between the world's two largest economies. A letter from Chinese Premier Li Qiang was delivered to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, likely urging Japan to join China in opposing protectionism. Japan is also considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. Trump said that tariffs on China will ultimately come down substantially. The IMF slashes 2025 world growth forecast to 2.8% on Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Bill Owens, the executive producer of "60 Minutes," announced his departure from CBS News after nearly four decades, citing disagreements over the direction of the show. His departure comes amid a lawsuit filed by President Trump against the network, alleging intentional misrepresentation in the editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Owens stated he would not be allowed to run the show as he always has, making independent decisions based on what is right for "60 Minutes" and the audience. CBS News has refuted Trump's claims, and the network's parent company, Paramount, is in mediation with Trump's legal team to reach a settlement.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty of conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. The Arizona jury reached the verdict after being handed the case on Monday. Daybell, representing herself, maintained that her brother shot Vallow in self-defense. Prosecutors argued it was a ploy to get his $1 million life insurance policy and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The case highlighted their “twisted” religious beliefs as justification for the murder.</p>

          <p>The Education Department will resume collecting payments for student loans in default, including through wage garnishment, starting May 5. More than 5 million borrowers are in default, with millions more at risk, potentially affecting a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio. Those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and repayment options, with wage garnishment notices sent later this summer. The announcement comes after the COVID-19 pandemic payment pause ended, and the Biden administration's efforts to wipe out student loan debt were rejected by the courts.</p>
