          <p>Resorts World Sentosa's CEO has affirmed the company's commitment to its multi-billion dollar expansion plans despite receiving a shortened casino license renewal from Singapore's gambling authority. The regulator cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023 for the reduced two-year term. The CEO stated the resort is shifting its focus from shopping to unique experiences, such as the new Minion Land and Singapore Oceanarium, to transform into a premium lifestyle destination and meet regulatory expectations for its next renewal in 2026.</p>

          <p>The parents of Harvey Willgoose, a 15-year-old who was fatally stabbed at his Sheffield school, are publicly calling for the court to lift the anonymity order protecting his 15-year-old killer. His mother argued that since her son's name was used throughout the trial, the convicted defendant's name should also be made public. The judge is expected to rule on the media's application to name the killer during the sentencing in October. The family is also continuing their campaign for knife arches in schools to prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have voiced strong skepticism about upcoming peace talks between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, from which they have been excluded. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that intelligence indicates Russia is preparing for new military offensives, not seeking a genuine end to the war. Kyiv firmly rejects any potential deal that would involve ceding Ukrainian territory, a possibility floated by Trump, asserting that no agreement about its future can be legitimate without its direct participation. The situation highlights Ukraine's precarious diplomatic position.</p>

          <p>During a UN meeting, China and the United States exchanged sharp accusations regarding influence over the Panama Canal. The U.S. ambassador raised concerns about China's "outsized influence" over critical infrastructure in the area, calling it a potential threat to global trade and security. In response, China's ambassador accused the U.S. of fabricating lies as a "pretext for seeking control of the canal" and urged Washington to respect Panama's sovereignty. The dispute reflects broader geopolitical tensions between the two nations over strategic global assets.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to have the plaintiffs improperly removed from a $240 million luxury housing project they had conceived and brought Ohtani into as a celebrity endorser. The plaintiffs claim Balelo made disruptive demands and pressured a business partner to terminate them for financial self-interest, seeking accountability for what they describe as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a 5.8% drop in vacancies to 718,000 between May and July. The Office for National Statistics also reported a slight decrease in the number of people on company payrolls, suggesting some firms are holding back on recruitment. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remained steady at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%. Economists suggest the cooling is gradual and may reflect the calming effects of recent rises in business taxes and the minimum wage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has suspended its search for a fisherman who went missing after a 40-foot vessel, Das Bug, capsized in rough seas off the coast of Oregon. The boat, carrying four crew members, was hit by 7-foot swells and strong winds near the Yaquina Bay Jetty. Three individuals were successfully rescued from the water and treated for hypothermia. Despite an extensive eight-hour search covering 54 square miles, crews were unable to locate the fourth crew member, leading to the difficult decision to suspend the operation.</p>

The planned talks, which exclude Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been met with caution, as Trump himself has lowered expectations and mentioned the possibility of "swapping" territory. Critics are concerned that granting Putin a high-profile meeting legitimizes his position while Ukraine's sovereignty hangs in the balance, portraying the talks as a high-stakes diplomatic gamble with an uncertain outcome.</p>

Analysts suggest Spain's minority government may be using these high-profile foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues.

          <p>A Ukrainian firm, Wild Hornets, has developed a low-cost interceptor drone capable of flying at speeds up to 195 miles per hour, roughly the velocity of a bullet train. The $2,500 first-person-view drone, named Sting, is designed to chase down and destroy Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions used by Russia. High speed is critical for interception, as the drones must catch the Shaheds, which fly at about 115 mph. This development is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to use innovative, cost-effective technology to bolster its air defenses against overwhelming drone attacks.</p>

Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon.

The instant retail market, which promises delivery within 30 minutes, is seen as a vital new driver for consumption.

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism in its less-developed regions, Nepal has made 97 of its Himalayan peaks free to climb for the next two years. The fee waiver applies to mountains in the remote Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, its first hike in nearly a decade. Officials hope the move will attract climbers to unexplored destinations, generating jobs and strengthening local economies in some of the country's poorest areas.</p>
