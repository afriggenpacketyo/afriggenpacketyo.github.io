          <p>The UK and the US have finalized a tariff agreement that reduces or eliminates tariffs on specific UK exports, including cars, steel, and aluminum, although blanket tariffs imposed by President Trump remain in place for most goods. For cars, import taxes have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs have been scrapped, which is significant news for firms like British Steel. Pharmaceuticals remain a big unknown in the deal, and there was no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms; instead, the countries agreed to work on a digital trade deal. The UK government said work will continue on remaining sectors and reciprocal tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, but faces opposition from Democrats due to concerns about President Trump's family's involvement in the cryptocurrency industry.

Elizabeth Warren argues that the bill could "supercharge Donald Trump's corruption" and undermine consumer protection laws, while Republicans emphasize the bill's importance in providing clarity for innovators. The legislation advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee with bipartisan support in March, but has since lost Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>Fertilizer made from sewage sludge, containing potentially unsafe levels of PFAS or "forever chemicals," is being used around the country, raising concerns about contamination of farmland and water supplies. The federal government does not regulate PFAS in sludge used as fertilizer, leaving states and communities to handle the issue. Some states have banned or restricted the use of sludge containing PFAS, while others are testing wastewater treatment plants and adopting guidelines for biosolids. Consumers can inquire about testing results and efforts to prevent PFAS from entering wastewater operations, but the long-term effects are still being studied.</p>

The city's tourism agency revised its forecast, estimating 64.1 million tourists will visit, including 400,000 more domestic travelers but 800,000 fewer foreign travelers. The decline is led by a drop in tourists from Canada, and there are fears that continued economic uncertainty could scramble travel plans from the rest of the world.</p>
