          <p>Following the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, European leaders issued a statement emphasizing the need for "ironclad security guarantees" for Ukraine. They welcomed Trump's efforts but reiterated that Ukraine must decide its own territorial future. President Trump announced on social media that he and President Zelenskyy, after a phone call, agreed the best path forward is a direct Peace Agreement rather than a ceasefire. Zelenskyy is now scheduled to travel to Washington on Monday to meet with Trump for further discussions.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 storm, becoming the first of the 2025 Atlantic season. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds near 160 mph, urging Caribbean islands to monitor its progress closely. While not currently forecast to directly impact the United States, the storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions to the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico over the weekend. Forecast models show the hurricane curving northward, remaining offshore of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin underwent "extreme rapid intensification," strengthening from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours. Meteorologists attribute this explosive growth to perfect conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit and low wind shear. While the storm's powerful winds are affecting nearby islands and prompting flood warnings, it is not forecast to make landfall in the continental United States. Officials in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas have taken precautionary measures, preparing shelters and closing seaports.</p>

          <p>Nationwide immigration arrests saw a 13% decrease in July, following a sharp increase the previous month, according to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Activist groups and protesters, particularly in cities like Portland, Oregon, believe their efforts may be contributing to the slowdown. They employ tactics such as nightly demonstrations and a "rapid-response" legal aid system to impede ICE operations. The lack of an ICE detention facility in Oregon, combined with the state's "sanctuary" law, further complicates large-scale arrests in the region.</p>

A person died after they and six others were caught in a rip current while swimming at a beach with no lifeguards on duty. The mayor clarified that while the beaches will remain open, the ocean will be off-limits after lifeguards leave, typically around 5 p.m. Law enforcement will issue summonses or even make arrests if swimmers refuse to exit the water, a measure aimed at preventing further tragedies.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly denied any intention of running for president in 2028, calling such claims a "flat-out lie." His statement came in response to attacks from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who accused a top Kennedy aide of laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and the administration's "make America healthy again" agenda. He characterized the accusations as an attempt by the "swamp" to create a divide between him and the president.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, who went on strike early Saturday. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the airline remain far apart on key issues, including wages and compensation for unpaid work. The strike, the first by the airline's flight attendants since 1985, is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily. The airline is advising affected customers not to go to the airport and is offering refunds, though rebooking options are limited.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a rescue team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>President Trump's apparent pivot from demanding an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a direct "peace agreement" with Russia has generated significant concern in Kyiv and European capitals. This new approach aligns more closely with Russia's long-standing position, which suggests a comprehensive settlement that could imply Ukrainian capitulation. The shift buys Russian President Vladimir Putin more time on the battlefield and seemingly undermines the unified stance of Ukraine and its allies, who have insisted an unconditional ceasefire must come first. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy later adopted a more urgent tone, stating that the "killings must stop as soon as possible."</p>

Ge Changchun argued for a top-down national strategy to close the technological gap with the United States in this emerging field. Space solar power involves orbiting stations that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The article notes that China's current research efforts are fragmented across universities and lack the capacity for such a large-scale systems project.</p>

          <p>A series of articles examines the modern trend of intensive parenting, highlighting its exhausting nature for adults and potential harm to children's development. It contrasts this with the "Lighthouse Parent" model, where parents act as steady, reliable guides without controlling every aspect of a child's journey. This approach encourages parents to resist the instinct to immediately solve their children's problems, allowing them to build confidence and resilience by navigating struggles on their own. The articles argue that stepping back is often the most beneficial action a parent can take.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska was not a negotiation between equals but the result of a long-term erosion of U.S. foreign policy leverage. The author argues that by easing sanctions, halting military aid to Ukraine, and undermining diplomatic institutions, the Trump administration has left itself with "no cards" to play against Vladimir Putin. The summit is framed as a humiliating spectacle for the U.S. and a confirmation that Putin can safely ignore Trump's desire to be seen as a peacemaker. The article concludes that regaining influence requires re-arming Ukraine and applying significant pressure on Russia.</p>

The report states Hardin exploited lax security in the prison kitchen where he worked, using items like Sharpie markers and discarded laundry to create a fake law enforcement uniform. He told investigators he simply walked up to a gate and directed the tower guard to open it, which they did without confirming his identity. Hardin was recaptured after nearly two weeks and has since been moved to a maximum-security facility.</p>

As a self-described recovering perfectionist prone to anxiety, she finds that getting up early provides her with essential time for herself before the day's demands begin. Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog. This approach prevents her from feeling rushed or starting the day with a sense of failure, allowing her to ground herself and generate creativity.</p>

Observers in Kyiv expressed dismay over the optics, including a red carpet and military flyover, for a leader they consider a war criminal responsible for a devastating invasion. While relieved that the summit produced no immediate concessions to Russia, many Ukrainians viewed the pomp as an irrational legitimization of an aggressor. The friendly tone and elaborate greeting were seen as a painful spectacle for a nation enduring an ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Samsung is re-emerging as a strong competitor to Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, largely driven by its innovative foldable screen technology. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share increased from 23% to 31%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to Canalys data. The new Z Fold and Z Flip models are gaining traction and positive attention, challenging the static design of the iPhone. While Apple still leads the market, this shift signals renewed competition, with analysts suggesting Apple may release its own foldable phone by 2026 to keep pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for developing emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative feelings. The first step is to visualize learning as a winding path, not a straight line, to better tolerate the frustration of the process. The second involves engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult feelings and build mental strength. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body and mind to tolerate discomfort.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has indicated he supports redrawing the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could significantly benefit the Republican party in the 2026 midterm elections. Following a favorable state supreme court ruling that approved his previous manipulation of districts in northern Florida, DeSantis is now eyeing districts in the southern part of the state. The governor's efforts are seen as part of a broader national Republican strategy to maintain control of the House of Representatives. Democrats in the state have decried the plan as a partisan power-play that silences voters.</p>

This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates having fallen dramatically over the past few decades.
