          <p>Senator Jack Reed, a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed shock at President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested Trump's stance might be politically motivated, especially as he contemplates potential military action against Iran. Reed highlighted that if the intelligence chief's testimony was false, it should have been corrected immediately, not only after Israeli actions, and so the senator is criticizing the president's motivations for dismissing the intelligence community's assessment. The article focuses on the political ramifications of differing intelligence assessments on Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel has ruled a Louisiana law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The court found that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and could isolate non-Christian students. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the Supreme Court, while similar laws in Arkansas and Texas face legal challenges. The ruling underscores the ongoing debate over the role of religion in public education and the interpretation of the First Amendment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that Iran might be strategically maneuvering President Trump by exploiting his aversion to responsibility and his susceptibility to influence from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The proposed strategy involves absorbing Israeli strikes, mobilizing Putin to dissuade Trump from military action, and agreeing to return to negotiations while delaying any meaningful progress. This approach leverages Trump's reluctance to seek congressional authorization, allocate necessary funding, and mobilize allies for a potential war with Iran. The author suggests that Trump's hesitation is a sign of his self-awareness of his inability to unify the nation for a major undertaking.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the crippling cost of in-home elder care, highlighting the story of a 100-year-old woman whose monthly care expenses amount to $18,600.
