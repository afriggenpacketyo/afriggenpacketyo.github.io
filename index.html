          <p>Activist investor Elliott Investment Management revealed a $2 billion investment in Workday, sending the company's stock up 9% to around $238.  Elliott expressed confidence in Workday's multi-year plan to boost long-term value. Workday, a leading provider of finance and human resources software, recently acquired Paradox, an AI-powered recruiting software company.  The investment comes as Workday shares have declined roughly 15% year-to-date, despite its substantial market capitalization of approximately $63 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts offer guidance on whether homeowners should refinance their home equity loans following anticipated interest rate cuts.  Refinancing is advisable for borrowers with high interest rates (at least a full percentage point higher than current rates) and significant loan balances.  However, refinancing may not be beneficial for those with already low rates, those planning to sell their homes soon, or those nearing loan payoff.  Careful consideration of closing costs and break-even points is crucial before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>
