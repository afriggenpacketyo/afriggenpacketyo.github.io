          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, escalating a conflict amid President Trump's efforts to remove her. The new allegations concern misrepresentations on mortgage and ethics documents for a condominium in Massachusetts, adding to a previous referral about properties in Michigan and Georgia. This action occurs as Cook is suing Trump to block her dismissal from the central bank, a move that has been characterized as an unprecedented challenge to the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's convicted former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has reportedly been indicted on charges of corruption and bribery. The accusations include providing funds for a stock manipulation scheme and accepting luxury gifts in exchange for business favors. This development adds to the political turmoil in the country, following her husband's arrest earlier this year for declaring martial law. Former President Yoon also faces severe charges, including insurrection, over his attempt to impose martial law in December 2024.</p>

          <p>The individual who attacked a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, was reportedly "obsessed with the idea of killing children," according to investigators. Police Chief Brian O'Hara stated that the attacker, identified as Robin Westman, appeared to have no specific target but expressed widespread hatred. The suspect, who had previously attended the church's school, used three firearms in the attack and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officials have described the incident as an act of domestic terrorism motivated by a hate-filled ideology.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, have asked a federal judge to prevent senior Trump administration officials from making what they call "baseless public attacks" against him. The motion claims that inflammatory statements from officials like DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, labeling Abrego Garcia an "MS-13 gang member," violate his right to a fair trial by tainting the jury pool. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges but was detained by ICE again upon release, facing potential deportation to Uganda.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old pregnant girl, Katelynn Strate, has died after being shot in the head during a road rage incident in Ponchatoula, Louisiana. Despite the tragedy, her baby was successfully delivered via an emergency C-section and is reportedly doing well in a neonatal intensive care unit. The suspect, 54-year-old Barry West, allegedly fired into the SUV Strate was a passenger in following a dispute over tailgating and has been charged with second-degree murder.

          <p>A large-scale Russian missile and drone attack struck Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, early Thursday, killing at least 15 people, including four children, and wounding dozens more. The assault, one of the largest since the full-scale invasion began, hit numerous civilian buildings, including a five-story residential block and a building housing the European Union Delegation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a "horrific and deliberate killing of civilians" and called for stronger international sanctions against Russia. The attack comes amid struggling diplomatic efforts to end the three-year war.</p>

          <p>Robert "Bobby" Salazar, a Fresno restaurant owner, has been federally charged with hiring a motorcycle gang member to set fire to one of his own restaurants for an insurance payout. Prosecutors allege that after closing the location, Salazar increased its insurance coverage before the April 2024 fire, from which he received a claim of nearly $1 million. Investigators used surveillance video and phone records to identify the alleged arsonists, one of whom reportedly confessed that Salazar had paid them. The court documents also detail a history of alleged arson and intimidation linked to Salazar.</p>

The project, led by charities The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to identify the specific genes responsible for their remarkable resilience. This genetic information could be vital for selecting the best oak trees to plant in the future, helping to restore Britain's depleted woodlands and support the vast ecosystems that depend on them.</p>

          <p>Starting in January 2026, all young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the National Health Service (NHS). The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, with a catch-up program for slightly older children. Previously, parents had to pay for the vaccine privately. Officials hope the program will not only protect children from the rare but severe complications of the virus but also reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has overruled a school board decision to display Israeli flags on all campuses, citing student safety concerns. The board had narrowly approved the display as part of a resolution to combat antisemitism during Jewish American Heritage Month. The proposal was controversial, with supporters viewing it as a sign of solidarity and critics arguing it was an inappropriate political statement in a public school setting, especially given the ongoing war in Gaza. The superintendent invoked his executive authority to halt the display until further notice.</p>

          <p>The UK government did not perform its own cost-benefit analysis for the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, a BBC investigation has learned. The government's claim that merging councils could save £2.9 billion over five years was based on a 2020 report commissioned by a lobbyist group, the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reorganization could potentially cost money and deliver no savings, depending on how it is implemented. Critics find it "astonishing" that the government embarked on such a major reform without its own independent financial assessment.</p>
