        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article details how new 50% U.S. tariffs, imposed by President Trump over India's oil purchases from Russia, are set to significantly diminish India's export competitiveness. Analysts predict a material impact on India's GDP, potentially reducing growth to 6% from 7%. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, face substantial risks. This move could force India to diversify its export destinations, while the U.S. can more easily find alternative suppliers.</p>

          <p>As the 2026 midterm elections approach, key Senate races are taking shape, with Democrats aiming to flip four seats to secure a majority against a Republican-held chamber. Competitive contests are emerging in states like North Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Texas, where open seats and contentious primaries are expected to drive significant spending. The political landscape is complicated by the 2024 presidential results in these states and the retirement of several Democratic incumbents. This article highlights the early dynamics and potential battlegrounds that will determine Senate control.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing mortgage fraud allegations she denies, has sparked concerns among Wall Street analysts about the central bank's independence. Cook, appointed to a 14-year term, plans to contest her removal in court, with the Fed stating it will abide by legal decisions. Analysts suggest that if successful, this move could allow Trump to appoint a majority of the Fed board by mid-2026, potentially influencing monetary policy. However, the article notes that influencing the broader rate-setting committee, the FOMC, would still require persuading other members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sophisticated retail crime ring, allegedly led by David Ahl, has been dismantled after orchestrating over 600 thefts from 71 Home Depot locations across Southern California, accumulating an estimated $10 million in merchandise. Authorities, through "Operation Kill Switch," arrested 14 individuals, charging nine key players with multiple felonies including organized retail theft and money laundering. The stolen high-value items, such as electrical components, were then resold through Ahl's electronics storefront.

          <p>The UN human rights office is demanding justice following an Israeli double strike on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza, which killed at least 20 people, including five journalists and four health workers. Israel's initial military inquiry claimed the strike targeted a Hamas camera, but did not explain the second attack minutes later. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation, with the UK Prime Minister calling it "indefensible." This article also notes ongoing Israeli protests demanding a hostage deal and an end to the war, amidst flagging diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled another $175 million in funding for California's high-speed rail project, further jeopardizing the state's long-delayed initiative. This follows a previous withdrawal of $4 billion in federal grants, which California is challenging in court as illegal. The funding cuts, targeting grade separation, design work, and a Madera station, add significant hurdles to the 16-year effort to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco by rail. This article highlights the escalating political clash between the Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom over the project's viability and funding.</p>
