        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated a desire to change how international laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted by British courts in asylum cases. The goal is to prevent foreign criminals and unsuccessful asylum seekers from blocking their deportation by claiming they would face worse prison or healthcare conditions in their home countries. Starmer stated he does not want to dismantle human rights laws but believes their application needs to be updated to address modern mass migration challenges. Critics, including human rights lawyers, argue that such legal arguments for avoiding deportation are already extremely rare and seldom successful.</p>

          <p>The opening of Munich's Oktoberfest was delayed after a major police operation was launched in the northern part of the city. A man reportedly set his parents' house on fire, rigged it with explosive traps, and then took his own life in what authorities are treating as a family dispute. Police discovered one deceased person and another with injuries at the scene, prompting a wide-scale investigation. As a precautionary measure, authorities delayed the opening of the Theresienwiese festival grounds to examine any possible connections to the incident, although they later stated there was no immediate danger to the public.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has removed its entire "Glossary of Extremism and Hate" following significant criticism for including the conservative group Turning Point USA (TPUSA). The backlash intensified after the recent assassination of TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk and included condemnation from figures like Elon Musk. The ADL, which had described TPUSA as having ties to right-wing extremists, stated it was retiring the glossary to explore more effective strategies for presenting its research. Critics had pointed out that the list included groups like TPUSA and the "America First" movement while omitting others like Antifa.</p>

          <p>Rescue operations are ongoing in Java, Indonesia, where a multi-story Islamic boarding school collapsed during illegal construction work. An estimated 91 students, mostly boys aged 12 to 18, are believed to be trapped under the debris after the structure fell during afternoon prayers. More than 300 rescue workers are racing against time to find survivors, though the operation is complicated by unstable concrete blocks.

          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager described her transition to international football as thoroughly enjoyable, comparing it to being a grandparent who sees players for short periods before they return to their clubs. Hayes, who led the U.S. to an Olympic gold medal just months after taking the role, feels the position allows her to focus more on long-term strategy. She expressed that she was ready for a change from the relentless pace of club football.</p>

          <p>A growing scandal in Australia has led to the recall of 18 sunscreen products over concerns they do not provide their claimed level of sun protection. The issue began when a consumer group's analysis found significant discrepancies, including one SPF 50+ product that tested as low as SPF 4. An investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has now raised concerns about a shared base formula used in over 20 sunscreens and the testing practices of a specific US-based lab. This has caused a major public backlash in a country with the world's highest rate of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily driven by leagues in England and the USA. While escalating fees indicate a healthier ecosystem with more investment, experts warn it is widening the gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete financially, with broadcasting and sponsorship deals lagging significantly behind their English and American counterparts.

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's framework for ending the Gaza war suggests its primary strength is the political momentum generated by Trump and key Arab nations, while its weakness lies in a significant lack of detail. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly accepted the plan, despite its mention of a pathway to a Palestinian state, an idea he has consistently opposed. However, Netanyahu later emphasized to his domestic audience that he would forcibly resist a Palestinian state, revealing conflicting interpretations of the ambiguous agreement. This ambiguity allows both sides to claim support for the plan while holding fundamentally different views on its outcome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to cause widespread disruption for Americans, with around 800,000 federal employees placed on unpaid leave. Travelers may face longer airport security lines and flight delays as essential but unpaid TSA workers and air traffic controllers could call in sick, as seen in past shutdowns. National Parks are expected to close or operate without staff, leading to potential vandalism, and services like passport processing may be delayed. While Washington D.C.'s Smithsonian museums plan to stay open for a few days using prior funds, the popular webcams at the National Zoo will be turned off.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist went undercover as a cleaner for seven weeks at Castlehill, a care home in Inverness, Scotland, uncovering distressing scenes of neglect and poor care. The investigation, prompted by a family's secret camera footage, revealed understaffing that led to residents being left in soiled clothes, not receiving timely assistance, and experiencing a profound loss of dignity. The article details the emotional toll on both residents and the reporter, highlighting a systemic crisis in the care sector marked by underfunding and staff shortages. The care home has since stated it is appalled by the findings and is investing in improvements.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mohammed Abu Mughaisib, a Médecins Sans Frontières medic recently evacuated from Gaza, has described the harrowing conditions faced by medical staff, including starvation. After two years of working in collapsing hospitals, he said he and his colleagues were often in pain from hunger, sometimes sipping glucose solution just to have enough energy to treat patients. He depicted a healthcare system in ruins, where patients lie on the floor due to a lack of beds and doctors must wait for one patient to die to admit another. He emphasized that the ongoing Israeli offensive has destroyed critical infrastructure, affecting the entire civilian population.</p>

          <p>Increasingly, high-skilled foreign professionals who came to the U.S. on H-1B work visas are choosing to leave the country, citing the instability and anxiety associated with the system. The article profiles Qian Zhang, a Dartmouth and Harvard graduate who left a six-figure job in Boston for Portugal after feeling like a "second-class citizen" whose entire life was tied to her employer. The difficulties of the H-1B visa, including processing delays and the fear of job loss leading to deportation, are causing a brain drain as talented individuals seek more welcoming immigration policies in other countries.</p>

          <p>A civilian employee of the U.S. Department of the Navy, Malika Brittingham, has been charged with falsely reporting an active shooter at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. The false report triggered a base-wide lockdown and a massive emergency response. According to the criminal complaint, Brittingham later admitted to fabricating the threat, explaining that she hoped the shared traumatic experience would help her "trauma bond" with coworkers who had been ostracizing her. Federal prosecutors condemned the act, stating that such fear-mongering would not be tolerated and undermines public trust.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of their wild-card series, showcasing a powerful offense that tied a club postseason record with five home runs. Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández each hit two homers, and starter Blake Snell delivered a strong performance with nine strikeouts over seven innings. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues were on display when three relievers struggled in the eighth inning, allowing three runs and turning a comfortable lead into a tense situation. Despite the late-game disorder, the Dodgers are now one win away from advancing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, a move that an ethics watchdog group called a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act. The message claimed Democrats were inflicting pain on Americans to secure a "$1.5 trillion wish list." The nonprofit group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, arguing that the partisan message on a government website is an illegal use of taxpayer funds for political purposes. This incident highlights the deep political divisions fueling the current government funding impasse.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown now in effect, active-duty military service members are required to continue performing their duties but will not receive their pay until a funding deal is reached. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown ends, military pay is not automatic unless Congress passes specific legislation, which it has not yet done. The Defense Department has published contingency plans prioritizing key missions and will keep essential civilian personnel on the job. Some financial institutions that serve military families, like USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union, are offering no-interest loans to help members manage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Housing experts suggest that the U.S. government shutdown will likely have a minimal impact on most Americans applying for mortgages, though some minor delays are possible. Conventional loans from private lenders should proceed as normal, but borrowers seeking government-backed loans from the FHA, VA, or USDA might face processing slowdowns due to furloughed staff. The USDA is expected to halt the issuance of new loans entirely during the shutdown. Another potential issue is for homebuyers in flood zones, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot sell new or renewal policies during a shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has confirmed that borrowers will still be required to make their student loan payments during the government shutdown. While payments are due, the shutdown will furlough the vast majority of the department's employees, which could make it difficult for borrowers to resolve issues with their loan servicers. The disbursement of most federal aid, such as Pell Grants and Direct Loans, is not expected to be significantly impacted as these funds were appropriated previously. However, advocacy groups warn that a prolonged shutdown could delay loan forgiveness applications and other support services.</p>

          <h2>More Young Americans Opt for Blue-Collar Careers Amid AI Threats and College Debt Concerns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing to pursue skilled trades like electricians and plumbers over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over high student loan debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar, entry-level jobs. A recent survey found that over half of Gen Z is worried about college debt, and 77% want a career that is difficult to automate. As a result, professions in the trades are losing their stigma and are increasingly seen as a secure and financially viable career path, offering opportunities for entrepreneurship and independence.</p>
