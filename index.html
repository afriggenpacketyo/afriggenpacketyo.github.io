          <p>In the initial practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso surprisingly set the fastest time, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. While Alonso is a renowned specialist at the Marina Bay circuit, his top performance is not seen as an indicator that Aston Martin will compete for pole position. It is more likely that his car was running with less fuel or a higher engine mode compared to his main rivals. The team remains optimistic for a strong weekend on a track that suits their high-downforce car design.</p>

          <p>Authorities are building a profile of Jihad Al-Shamie, the 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent who carried out the deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue. Al-Shamie, who lived in Prestwich, was reportedly a weightlifting enthusiast who kept to himself and was not previously on the radar of counter-terrorism agencies. His family released a statement condemning the heinous act, expressing their profound shock and distancing themselves from his actions. Neighbors described him as an ordinary person who alternated between Western and traditional Syrian clothing, making his radicalization a surprise to those who knew him superficially.</p>

          <p>At a recent forum, financial experts highlighted Hong Kong's enduring strength as a global asset and wealth management hub, primarily due to its role as a gateway to mainland China. Panelists, including a managing director from China International Capital Corp, asserted that as China's economy continues to open up, Hong Kong will benefit significantly from capital influx and the establishment of family offices. This unique position within the Greater Bay Area allows the city to act as a "superconnector" for both mainland and international markets. The trend is expected to attract more innovative tech companies and lower funding costs, fostering a positive macroeconomic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant operation off the coast of Somaliland, the local coast guard rescued eleven cheetah cubs from illegal traffickers, an event described as one of the largest confiscations of the endangered species. The cubs were found in poor condition, packed in bags on a small boat, highlighting the region's role as a major transit hub for the illegal pet trade to Gulf countries. The Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) is now rehabilitating the surviving animals, though two have already died due to severe malnourishment.

          <p>A federal judge is set to sentence music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. While Combs was acquitted of more serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, citing a history of violent behavior. In contrast, his defense team is arguing for a 14-month sentence, presenting over 75 letters of support and a letter from Combs himself apologizing for his past actions. The judge will also hear a victim impact statement from a former assistant who alleged she was sexually assaulted by him.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian protests proceeded in London and Manchester shortly after a deadly terrorist attack on a synagogue. She described the decision to continue with the demonstrations as "un-British" and urged organizers to "step back" out of respect for the victims. The protests, which led to clashes with police and 40 arrests in London, were met with criticism from Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis, who argued that such marches contain antisemitic elements and cannot be separated from the violent outcomes they may inspire. He called on the government to take a stronger stance on managing these demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are unprepared to effectively combat Donald Trump's political tactics, particularly in the context of a potential government shutdown. The article suggests their traditional, methodical communication styles are outdated and ineffective in the current political landscape, which is dominated by spectacle and the need for viral moments. The author contrasts their approach with Trump's ability to control the narrative through chaotic but attention-grabbing rhetoric. The piece concludes that without leaders who can compete in this new "attention economy," the Democratic Party risks not only losing policy battles but also the broader political narrative.</p>

          <p>New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that mothers in England experience a substantial and long-term decrease in their earnings after having children, a phenomenon known as the "motherhood penalty." Five years after the birth of their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, £1,051 lower than they were a year before childbirth. This financial impact is attributed to factors like unaffordable childcare, an unbalanced parental leave system, and maternity discrimination. Campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed called the findings "abhorrent" and emphasized that this penalty is the primary driver of the UK's gender pay gap.</p>

Its popularity exploded after a viral ASMR-style video, leading to numerous imitations and a high price point due to its expensive ingredients and labor-intensive production.

This strategy has led to a series of lawsuits, where states challenge the legality of conditioning funds for programs like crime victim services and disaster relief on cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. When courts block one attempt, the administration often shifts its approach to target the same funds from a different angle, creating a complex and continuous legal battle.

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England squad for the upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. However, manager Thomas Tuchel has notably left out key players such as Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham, who is still returning to full fitness, and Manchester City's Phil Foden. The decision reflects Tuchel's desire for continuity, keeping faith with the players who secured a dominant win against Serbia in the last international window. The squad selection prioritizes recent form and team cohesion as England looks to secure qualification for the next World Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has voiced his support for the legalization of all drugs, including Class A substances like heroin and crack cocaine. Arguing that the "war on drugs has absolutely failed," Polanski called for a public health-led approach to drug policy rather than a criminal justice one. He contended that legalization would undermine criminal gangs and that the current system is already costly for taxpayers due to crime and illegal markets. This stance is part of a broader platform Polanski is promoting, which he describes as appealing to a wide range of voters despite its perceived radicalism.</p>

          <p>An international research team has made a significant breakthrough in developing a vaccine against elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), a leading cause of death in young Asian elephants. In trials conducted at Chester Zoo, the vaccine proved safe for adult elephants and successfully stimulated the production of T-cells, which are crucial for fighting viral infections. EEHV causes a severe hemorrhagic disease that is fatal in over 80% of cases in juvenile elephants. This successful first trial is a landmark moment that could pave the way for preventing the deaths of young elephants in both captivity and the wild.</p>

Blair, who was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, has called Trump's plan "bold and intelligent." However, his potential involvement has drawn significant criticism due to his controversial role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has tainted his reputation both at home and abroad. The appointment has been met with skepticism from some Palestinian figures and international observers, who view him as a polarizing figure.</p>

          <p>South Dakota's statewide public media network has been forced to make drastic cuts after congressional Republicans, pressured by President Trump, eliminated federal funding for public broadcasting. The network, which serves a largely rural and conservative state, has slashed its newsroom from 11 journalists to just four and canceled its signature daily public affairs radio show. The loss of $2.3 million, nearly a quarter of its budget, means the broadcaster will ironically rely more on national programming from NPR and PBS. The cuts highlight the severe impact of the defunding on local stations that provide essential news and community services.</p>
