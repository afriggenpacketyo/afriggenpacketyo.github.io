          <p>During an Oval Office event marking the end of his role with the Trump administration, Elon Musk reacted sharply to a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign. Musk questioned the credibility of the Times, referencing their Russiagate reporting. The article details allegations of Musk's ketamine use, sometimes daily, and mentions concerns from associates about potential harm to his businesses. Musk has publicly stated he has a prescription for ketamine and uses it infrequently to manage depression. The event also highlighted Musk's work in the Department of Government Efficiency, where he aimed to cut federal spending.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey indicated that the UK's defense spending is projected to increase to 3% of GDP by 2034. This statement comes as the government prepares to release its strategic defense review, outlining military and security spending priorities. The review assumes the 3% target is the trajectory for spending, with potential for faster project delivery. New funding for defense will be partially sourced by reducing overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, a move that has faced criticism.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is alerting consumers to fraudulent websites that claim to sell rice at heavily discounted prices, as rice prices have been steadily increasing due to a poor harvest. Complaints about these websites have risen sharply since March, with some customers reporting that they never received their orders despite payment. The center advises consumers to carefully vet business operators and avoid deals that seem too good to be true. The government is attempting to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles and negotiating direct contracts to lower costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to rising prices and inflation, with visitor numbers down compared to last year. While convention traffic remains strong, fewer international visitors are impacting the city's revenue, as they tend to stay longer and spend more. Higher hotel rates and traffic congestion are also contributing to the perception that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain destination. Despite these challenges, the city's summer calendar is packed with events, and officials remain optimistic about its resilience.</p>

          <p>Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers, the No. 1 overall pick in the WNBA Draft, has been placed in concussion protocol after a game against Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky. The move will force her to miss at least two games, including a rematch against the Sky. The team did not provide specific details on what led to the move, and it's unclear what prompted Bueckers to go into protocol. Bueckers has been a key player for the Wings, averaging 14.7 points and a team-high 6.7 assists in her first six professional games.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50% and celebrated an agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. He declared the dramatic hike would "even further secure the steel industry in the United States”. Trump framed the administration’s drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security. Trump also repeated many of the false claims that have become a feature of his rallies including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized that the U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, bringing in more jobs for Americans.

The author suggests that redefining "harm," "abuse," and "trauma" has created a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. Adult children seem increasingly likely to cut off contact with parents, citing emotional or relational struggles. This cultural shift may contribute to a dread of parenthood, as individuals fear they cannot meet the unreachable standards they've set for their own parents.</p>
