          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are set for a generally positive opening as investors await a crucial slate of economic data from China. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast China's third-quarter GDP growth to slow to 4.8% year-on-year, a decrease from the prior quarter's 5.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures indicate a stronger start, contrasting with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 opening slightly lower. US markets closed higher on Friday, influenced by a more conciliatory tone regarding trade talks with China and a recovery from regional bank concerns.

          <p>Max Verstappen of Red Bull secured a dominant victory at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, further intensifying the championship battle against McLaren drivers. Lando Norris finished second, with Oscar Piastri in fifth, reducing Piastri's championship lead to 14 points over Norris. Verstappen's win, his seventh at this event and fifth of the season, came after converting pole position into an early lead, despite a different tire strategy from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. The race saw a virtual safety car period due to a collision, and Norris eventually overtook Leclerc with five laps remaining. The score reflects a strong performance.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid growth, expanding three times faster than the firsthand market, projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. This surge highlights the critical role of authentication, as sophisticated counterfeits, or "superfakes," make verification challenging even for luxury brands. Resale platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary authentication systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to ensure product legitimacy. This focus on trust is boosting business, particularly among younger consumers who value affordability, rarity, and the ability to resell items, reshaping how people engage with luxury goods.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence is investigating allegations that Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents, including details of eight RAF and Royal Navy bases and MoD staff information, subsequently publishing them on the dark web. The breach reportedly originated from a ransomware incident at Dodd Group, a maintenance contractor. This incident follows previous high-profile data breaches affecting the MoD, including the exposure of personal data for thousands of Afghans brought to the UK and an earlier breach affecting serving military personnel. The MoD stated it is actively investigating but would not comment further to safeguard operational information.</p>

          <p>A cargo plane, operating as Emirates flight Aerotranscargo from Dubai, tragically skidded off a runway at Hong Kong International Airport, crashing into the sea. The incident, which happened just before 04:00 local time, involved the aircraft striking a vehicle on the north runway. Local media reports indicate at least one person has died. While four crew members were rescued and hospitalized, the status of two ground staff who fell into the sea remains uncertain. The north runway is currently closed for investigation and recovery, though the airport's other two runways are still in operation, minimizing broader disruption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers were decisively defeated 38-24 by the Indianapolis Colts, primarily due to NFL leading rusher Jonathan Taylor's three-touchdown performance. Despite the Chargers' all-gold uniforms and retro logos, their defense proved ineffective when it mattered most. Quarterback Justin Herbert threw two critical first-half interceptions, contributing to a significant halftime deficit. The team also grappled with ongoing offensive line injuries, highlighting a persistent vulnerability. This loss adds to the Chargers' inconsistent season, underscoring challenges in maintaining defensive consistency and protecting their quarterback, as they prepare for a short week ahead.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI will proceed in his court, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the region. Judge Mark Pittman issued an ironically-toned order, suggesting the companies consider relocating their headquarters to Fort Worth, a subtle critique of "forum-shopping" practices. The lawsuit, initiated by Elon Musk's entities, accuses Apple and OpenAI of engaging in an anticompetitive scheme to monopolize the artificial intelligence market. Specifically, it alleges Apple prioritizes OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store, disadvantaging rivals like xAI's Grok.</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the finding, while the Secret Service released a photo of what appeared to be a platform or hunting stand high in a tree. Sources indicate the stand was over 200 yards away, across a highway, and likely present for months, only becoming a concern as Trump resumed using that part of the airport after construction.

          <p>Amid a US government shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Ambassador Jamieson Greer accused China of wielding "economic coercion" through new export controls on critical rare earth minerals and EV battery tech. This article, set against the backdrop of IMF meetings, highlights US trade policy's impact, the muted effect of Trump's tariffs, and concerns about an AI tech bubble potentially insulating the US economy from trade disruptions. The US views China's actions as weaponizing fears of an economic downturn, prompting calls for global allies to secure alternative supply chains, even as G20 ministers express frustration over US tariff policies.

          <p>Donald Trump reportedly engaged in a "shouting match" with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a closed-door meeting, warning him to accept Russia's terms to avoid being "destroyed" by Vladimir Putin. According to The Financial Times, Trump adopted many of Putin's talking points, insisting Zelensky surrender the Donbas region and expressing frustration with battlefield maps. Zelensky later called for "decisive steps" from international powers to end the war. Trump also reportedly declined to commit to sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, citing domestic needs. This article highlights a contentious diplomatic encounter and Trump's skeptical stance on Ukraine's war efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the current multipolar world, marked by the transition from American unipolarity, requires managed accommodation rather than rigid alliances to prevent catastrophic conflict, drawing lessons from Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's 1970s diplomacy. The author identifies two distinguishing factors: nuclear weapons making total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture. Despite the inherent complexities of modern supply chains and financial ties, the article suggests these factors create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid a breakdown, advocating for patient statecraft over confrontation in navigating great power competition.</p>

The memoir also touches on her 2022 settlement with Prince Andrew and the broader, sinister details of Epstein's sexual assault trafficking network, where girls were subjected to habitual abuse and humiliation.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries campaigned at Black churches in Los Angeles for California's Proposition 50, a redistricting effort aimed at adding Democratic representatives. Amid a congressional deadlock over healthcare subsidies and a government shutdown, Jeffries criticized Republicans for refusing to negotiate and attempting to gerrymander maps. The proposition seeks to counteract Republican-led redistricting in states like Texas by having California's citizens redraw maps to create more Democratic seats. While Republicans, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, label it a "big scam," Democrats argue it ensures fairness and allows citizens to decide, highlighting the importance of voting for healthcare access.</p>
