          <p>Joseph Nye, the American scholar known as the father of 'soft power,' passed away, prompting varied reactions in China. During his life, Chinese scholars widely praised Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasizes cultural and value-based influence over hard power tactics. However, after his death, Chinese scholars expressed caution regarding his intellectual legacy, suggesting his policy influence was limited and his stance towards China was not always perceived as friendly. Despite this, Nye's soft power concept has been embraced by Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, and has been the subject of numerous studies by Chinese scholars and officials.</p>

          <p>The European Union announced plans to increase pressure on the United States through retaliatory tariffs in response to the Trump administration's trade policies. The EU is considering tariffs on $107 billion worth of American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans and bourbon, as well as manufactured goods such as airplane parts. This move follows previous tariff actions by the U.S. and the EU, with the EU aiming to create a clear threat to encourage trade negotiations with the U.S. European officials are also considering a long-term rebalancing of their trade relationship with the United States, indicating a potential shift towards more permanent trade measures.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed the majority of claims against celebrities and YouTubers who endorsed the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The lawsuit alleged that these high-profile figures promoted FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, violating advertising laws. However, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. This decision narrows the scope of the litigation following FTX's collapse in 2022, which resulted in billions of dollars in customer losses.</p>

          <p>Health care facilities across the United States are reporting an increase in missed appointments and a reluctance among immigrants to seek medical care, driven by fears of deportation. This trend has intensified since the Trump administration announced plans for mass deportations and rescinded protections for sensitive locations like hospitals. Health professionals worry that this avoidance of care will lead to the spread of infectious diseases, increased health care costs, and dangerous complications for pregnant women. A survey indicates that concerns about immigration status are negatively affecting the health of many immigrants, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and disruptions in sleep and eating habits.</p>

          <p>A trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom is expected to provide some economic relief and boost confidence, but it faces limitations in significantly lifting the overall British economy. The deal is likely to support sectors like the auto industry, but the U.K.'s trade is heavily skewed towards services, which are not directly impacted by tariffs. Economists suggest that the greater threat to Britain is the global uncertainty created by Trump's trade policies, rather than specific tariffs on Britain, as domestic factors are more central to the U.K.'s economic story.</p>

The judge noted that the scope of the family's proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews, mitigating the risk of altered statements.
