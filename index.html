          <p>Firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, were ambushed and shot at by an unknown gunman. According to the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office, the incident began after fire personnel arrived to combat a small but growing blaze. As they worked, they came under fire from someone in the woods, prompting a major law enforcement response. Authorities are investigating whether the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders to the scene, which is being treated as an active shooter situation with a shelter-in-place order in effect.</p>

          <p>A recent Air India crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner has intensified scrutiny of the aircraft's safety record, despite it previously being considered one of the safest planes. This article provides a deep dive into the 787's history, from its innovative, fuel-efficient design to a series of production issues and quality control problems. It highlights serious allegations from multiple whistleblowers, including the late John Barnett, who claimed that manufacturing pressures led to compromised safety standards and the use of substandard parts. While Boeing denies the claims, the concerns have cast a shadow over the aircraft's legacy.</p>

The ceremony honored Parker, who won championships with both franchises, as her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters at Crypto.com Arena. On the court, Chicago's Angel Reese delivered a dominant performance with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle.

          <p>Colorado Rockies interim manager Warren Schaeffer was ejected for the first time in his career during a game against the Brewers, reacting with a memorable display of passion. After his player was tossed for arguing a strike call, Schaeffer stormed from the dugout, spiked his hat, and vehemently argued with the umpire. The fiery display, which included him drawing a line in the dirt to show the pitch's location, seemed to galvanize his team. The Rockies, who have MLB's worst record, went on to rally and ultimately defeated Milwaukee 4-3 in extra innings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a major Republican legislative package that proposes significant tax cuts and increased immigration spending. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill is estimated to increase the national debt by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. The analysis also projects that the legislation would cause 11.8 million Americans to lose their health insurance coverage by 2034 due to substantial cuts in healthcare funding. The stark projections present a challenge for Republican leadership as they push to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have launched a nationwide crackdown on writers of 'danmei,' a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, arresting at least 30 authors since February. The writers, nearly all young women, are accused of producing and distributing obscene material, a crime that can carry a prison sentence of over 10 years. The arrests, primarily targeting authors on the Taiwan-hosted platform Haitang, have sparked a rare online debate about China's strict censorship laws and the policing of female expression. Observers note that while heterosexual erotica often receives more leeway, the subversive nature of danmei appears to draw greater scrutiny from Beijing.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting statements from the White House, top officials, and intelligence reports have created confusion about the extent of the damage. While the president claimed the facilities were 'obliterated,' a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment reportedly suggested the strikes only set back Iran's program by months. Officials have since offered shifting descriptions, with some downplaying the physical destruction and instead emphasizing that the strikes successfully led to a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. The evolving narrative continues to fuel questions about the attack's true impact and objectives.</p>

He also reiterated that Iran would insist on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting demands for zero enrichment.

The suspension stems from a sexual assault allegation made against him in a civil lawsuit, which Retzlaff denies.

          <p>A contentious proposal to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. The provision, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced significant bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups who feared the privatization of federal lands. Lee stated he withdrew the measure because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests. The removal marks a victory for public land advocates, though they remain wary of future attempts to sell federal lands.</p>

          <p>England's national football team received a significant boost as star player Lauren James made her return from a three-month hamstring injury. In a dominant 7-0 friendly victory over Jamaica, James came off the bench and made an immediate impact, providing a perfect assist within eight minutes. Her return is a timely one for the Lionesses, who are just days away from beginning their Euro 2025 title defense against France. While her match fitness is still being built, her creative spark and versatility give manager Sarina Wiegman a powerful weapon for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election, a decision that follows a public clash with former President Donald Trump. The conflict arose after Tillis voted against advancing the GOP's major budget bill, citing concerns about its 'devastating' cuts to Medicaid funding for his state. In response, Trump publicly attacked Tillis and threatened to support a primary challenger against him. In his retirement announcement, Tillis lamented that independent-thinking and bipartisan lawmakers are becoming an 'endangered species' in Washington.</p>
