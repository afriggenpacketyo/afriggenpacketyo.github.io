          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with only the feet remaining. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze after being set on fire in 2020, had been commissioned by an American artist, Brad Downey, who viewed it as an interrogation of President Trump's immigration policies. Residents of Sevnica suspect the theft could be an act of vandalism or that the statue was melted down for cash, with many not particularly fond of the sculpture. The town has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump through various branded products. </p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a civilian bus in Bilopillia, Ukraine, has reportedly killed nine people and injured seven others. Ukrainian officials described the attack as a cynical war crime, while Russia claimed it hit a military staging area in Sumy. The attack occurred hours after Russia and Ukraine held peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey, where they agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each. Ukraine has reiterated its call for a full and unconditional ceasefire, with the next step being direct talks between presidents Zelensky and Putin.</p>

The fishermen have repeatedly expressed their desire to return home, but North Korea has severed all communications with the South.

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas. The study also found that early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, affecting their genetic traits and vulnerability to certain diseases.</p>
