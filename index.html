          <p>Rome is experiencing a unique atmosphere following the death of Pope Francis, marked by both mourning and reflection, as tens of thousands queue to pay their respects. The city is under heightened security as it prepares for the Pope's funeral, with soldiers deploying anti-drone devices and increased police presence. Despite the somber mood, many express gratitude for the Pope's peaceful passing and celebrate his commitment to the poor and marginalized. The funeral procession will take place along Via della Conciliazione, allowing the public to bid farewell to the Pope. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggests the UK's trade relationship with the EU is more crucial than that with the US, despite ongoing efforts to secure a US trade deal. Reeves highlights the importance of rebuilding trade relationships with European neighbors and acknowledges the difficulties arising from global tariffs. She understands President Trump's motivations for addressing global imbalances through tariffs but emphasizes the need for agreements beneficial to British jobs and consumers. The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May to 'reset' the relationship between the two.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times/Siena College poll indicates that voters are increasingly worried about President Trump's expansion of executive power and express doubts about his agenda. Majorities view his administration's early months as "chaotic" and "scary," even among some supporters. Voters feel that Trump does not understand their daily struggles, and his approval ratings have declined as he approaches his 100th day in office. Confidence in his handling of key issues like the economy and immigration is also waning, despite support for deportations.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on members of the European Parliament in what observers see as an attempt to improve relations with the EU amidst trade tensions with the US. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, targeted MEPs who criticized China's human rights record in Xinjiang. While some sanctioned MEPs remain skeptical, experts believe this move could signal a potential detente between the EU and China ahead of a planned summit. However, significant constraints, such as Beijing's ties to Moscow, remain on any broader rapprochement.</p>

          <p>The case of Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is notable as the DOJ is seeking the death penalty, tying it to President Trump's executive order to restore federal executions.

Mangione's attorneys argue that the Attorney General's directive was political and violated Justice Department protocol.

          <p>Two recently published books, Charlotte Beradt's "Third Reich of Dreams" and Laila Lalami's "The Dream Hotel," explore the connection between dreams and real-world implications. Beradt documents the dreams of Germans during Hitler's rise, showing how the Nazis infiltrated their minds. Lalami imagines a future where a surveillance state monitors dreams and incarcerates those deemed likely to commit crimes. These works suggest that dreams, though beyond conscious control, may be our purest expressions of free will.</p>

          <p>Stars from the reality television show "Love on the Spectrum" are pushing back against comments made by US Health and Human Services chief Robert F Kennedy Jr, who questioned the contributions of autistic people. Kennedy's remarks, claiming autistic people will never contribute to society, sparked widespread anger. While some advocate for acceptance and inclusion, others express the need for greater understanding of autism and support for those with more severe challenges.</p>
