          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled for a closed-door deposition with Congress regarding his personal involvement in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death. Barr's unusual hands-on approach, including reviewing surveillance footage himself, has drawn scrutiny, especially after a CBS News analysis found inconsistencies between his public statements and the video evidence. Lawmakers are expected to question Barr about these discrepancies and the overall integrity of the Justice Department's probe into the high-profile death in federal custody, which has fueled numerous conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to President Donald Trump, has publicly condemned India for its ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil, labeling the act as "opportunistic." In a Financial Times op-ed, Navarro argued that India is undermining international sanctions against Russia and stated that if India wishes to be a strategic partner to the U.S., it must align its actions accordingly. These comments follow the administration's plan to impose additional tariffs on India, raising the total to 50%, a move India has described as unfair and unjustified.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk surged after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a serious liver disease known as MASH. This approval marks a significant expansion for the GLP-1 class of drugs beyond weight loss and diabetes, positioning Wegovy as the first authorized treatment for this condition affecting millions of U.S. adults. The company's stock also rose following an announcement to reduce the cash price of its related drug, Ozempic, increasing accessibility for patients.</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires across Spain and Portugal have resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total to four, including two firefighters who died in separate accidents. Spain has deployed 1,900 troops to combat the blazes, which have forced the evacuation of 27,000 residents and scorched hundreds of thousands of hectares this year. The fires are part of a broader pattern of extreme weather across southern Europe, which meteorologists attribute to the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves caused by human-induced climate change.</p>

The strike, which involved multiple Shahed drones, occurred just before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss a potential peace deal. Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a "demonstrative and cynical" act by Russia, intended to exert pressure and undermine diplomatic efforts to end the ongoing war.</p>

This meeting follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after which the administration's focus shifted from a simple ceasefire to a broader, more permanent peace deal. U.S. officials have indicated that achieving this will require concessions from both sides, with discussions expected to cover security guarantees, territorial issues, and reconstruction efforts for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Hamas negotiators have reportedly received a new proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, which includes an initial 60-day truce and a two-phase release of hostages. According to a Palestinian official, the plan serves as a framework to begin negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict, and Hamas leadership is currently conducting internal consultations. This development comes as human rights groups like Amnesty International accuse Israel of a "deliberate policy" of starvation in Gaza, a claim Israel rejects, amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory.</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season has revealed notable tactical shifts and challenges for top clubs. Arne Slot's Liverpool displayed potent attacking football but appeared highly vulnerable to counter-attacks, a significant departure from their defensive solidity last season. Meanwhile, Arsenal's new focus on direct, fast-paced attacks proved less effective against Manchester United, suggesting the team is still balancing its traditional possession-based style with a more transitional approach. These early games highlight how new personnel and strategic adjustments are already shaping the competitive landscape of the league.</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" is replacing the "great resignation," as workers increasingly hold onto their current positions amid economic uncertainty. Organizational consultants note that the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs is near its lowest point in years, reflecting anxiety about finding new employment in a cooling labor market. This stagnation is driven by a lower hiring rate and CEO plans to shrink workforces.

          <p>Alphabet's Google and nuclear startup Kairos Power are collaborating to deploy an advanced nuclear reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor, a 50-megawatt plant, will supply carbon-free electricity to power Google's regional data centers, supporting the tech giant's energy-intensive AI operations. This partnership aims to commercialize new, smaller nuclear technology by having the private companies bear the financial risk of construction, while the TVA provides a stable revenue stream through a power purchase agreement.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the nation's largest airline and affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations reached an impasse, with key issues being wages and unpaid work time. The airline responded with a lockout notice and has started a gradual suspension of operations, warning of a complete shutdown by Saturday if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale classifies hurricanes into five categories based on their sustained wind speeds, providing an estimate of potential property damage. A Category 1 storm features winds of 74-95 mph causing "some damage," while a Category 5 storm, with winds of 157 mph or higher, can inflict "catastrophic damage," rendering areas uninhabitable for months. Storms rated as Category 3 or higher are designated as "major hurricanes" due to their potential for significant loss of life, a crucial distinction for public preparedness during hurricane season.</p>
