          <p>Mark Killick, a "prolific rogue trader" known for his charm, has been found guilty of 37 counts of fraud after failing to complete building work across the West of England between 2019 and 2021. This marks his fourth fraud conviction since 2008, with prosecutors emphasizing his lavish spending, such as a £25,000 Rolex, even as his business struggled. Killick claimed factors like the pandemic and a car accident caused delays, but the judge has indicated an inevitable lengthy custodial sentence for his actions. Over 100 complaints were lodged against him, highlighting the vast financial and personal harm inflicted on victims.</p>

          <p>The final New York City mayoral debate was characterized by stinging attacks among the three candidates: Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani faced criticism for his perceived inexperience and pro-Palestinian advocacy, with Sliwa even accusing him of supporting "global jihad." Cuomo was challenged over past sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor. Despite their animosity, all candidates condemned recent federal immigration raids in Manhattan. The election's outcome will determine who succeeds incumbent Eric Adams, who withdrew amidst fraud allegations, reflecting a tumultuous political landscape.</p>

          <p>China's struggling real estate sector is unlikely to receive significant government intervention, despite its persistent drag on economic growth, as Beijing prioritizes technological development. Analysts observe a notable divergence between official optimism regarding the property market's recovery and the ongoing market realities, with real estate investment falling 13.9% in the first three quarters. The government's emphasis on tech growth and new development strategies within its five-year plan signals limited additional property support. This continues to weigh on homebuyer sentiment and broader economic stability, with experts predicting further declines in home sales for the next 12-18 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four survivors of sexual abuse have withdrawn from a government inquiry into grooming gangs, demanding Minister Jess Phillips resign before they reconsider rejoining. Their departure follows Phillips' public contradiction of their concerns regarding the inquiry's scope and potential conflicts of interest with chair candidates. The survivors stated Phillips' dismissal of their accounts felt like a betrayal, destroying trust. While some survivors remain on the panel, supporting a wider inquiry scope, two potential chairs have also withdrawn, citing a "highly charged and toxic environment."</p>

French police are hesitant to intervene at sea due to safety risks and potential legal implications, while a lack of equipment and personnel also hinders operations.

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its second airstrike on an alleged drug cartel vessel in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, killing three men. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated these strikes, which he calls a "war" against "narco-terrorists," will continue daily, equating cartels to "al Qaeda of our hemisphere." This brings the total killed in nine known U.S. strikes since September to 37. President Trump defended the lethal force, suggesting a potential expansion of operations to land targets, raising legal questions about the unprecedented use of military force against alleged smugglers.</p>

          <p>Southern California residents face property damage risks from falling city-maintained trees, especially with the upcoming winter storm season. One Burbank woman, Angela Towne, battled the city for over a year and a half after a dead tree damaged her car, ultimately losing her small claims appeal. Cities often deny such claims, blaming "acts of Mother Nature," but an attorney notes liability exists if the city failed to properly maintain the tree or address complaints. Experts advise documenting tree conditions and submitting written requests to cities to protect property owners' rights.</p>
