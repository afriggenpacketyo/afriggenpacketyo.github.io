          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly condemned an Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, that targeted Hamas leaders, stating the action undermines the goals of both Israel and the United States. In a social media post, Trump expressed that he was notified too late to intervene and emphasized that the unilateral decision was made by Prime Minister Netanyahu. The strike, which killed six people, drew a strong rebuke from Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the region, which described the attack as a blatant violation of international law. Trump's statement marks a rare criticism of Netanyahu, highlighting the diplomatic sensitivity of the operation on the soil of a sovereign partner.</p>

          <p>Despite missing current earnings and revenue estimates, Oracle's stock surged after the company released exceptionally strong forward-looking financial projections. Analysts expressed shock at the massive growth trajectory, which is primarily driven by the company's booming cloud infrastructure business and new artificial intelligence contracts. Oracle forecasts its cloud infrastructure revenue will jump 77% this fiscal year to $18 billion and continue to grow exponentially in subsequent years. The company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted future revenue, soared to $455 billion, signaling a seismic shift in its market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish online lender Klarna priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, surpassing its initial target range and valuing the company at approximately $15 billion. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, successfully raised $1.37 billion, with the majority of the funds going to existing shareholders. This strong market debut on the New York Stock Exchange reflects a growing investor appetite for technology IPOs. The offering serves as a significant test for Klarna as it attempts to rebrand as a broader digital retail bank amid recently widening net losses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study by Unicef has revealed a significant global health milestone: for the first time, the number of children aged five to nineteen who are obese has surpassed the number who are underweight. Researchers attribute this shift to the widespread replacement of traditional diets with cheap, high-calorie, ultra-processed foods. The report indicates that nearly one in ten children and adolescents, totaling around 188 million, are now affected by obesity. Unicef is urging governments to implement policies that protect children from unhealthy diets and curb the influence of the ultra-processed food industry.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune is preparing to deploy a parliamentary maneuver known as the "nuclear option" to expedite the confirmation of lower-level presidential nominees. This move would alter Senate precedent, lowering the vote threshold required to break a filibuster for certain groups of nominees from 60 to a simple majority of 51. The strategy follows similar actions taken by past leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, which gradually eroded the filibuster's power.

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, offering hope for a revolution in how the condition is diagnosed. The test, which identifies the rogue protein p-tau217, is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90%, providing a significant improvement over current cognitive tests. Led by University College London, the study will involve over 1,000 patients at NHS memory clinics to assess its effectiveness in a real-world clinical setting. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could become a standard diagnostic tool, improving early detection and access to emerging treatments.</p>

Critics argue that after early reforms, Erdogan's 22-year rule has become increasingly autocratic, marked by crackdowns on dissent and the weaponization of the courts.

The action is timed to draw attention from lawmakers ahead of an expected budget announcement in November.</p>

          <p>China's largest government-backed research fund is now accepting grant applications for the study of stablecoins and their cross-border monitoring, indicating a growing, albeit wary, interest in the digital asset class. The National Natural Science Foundation of China is offering funding for projects that can provide policy suggestions on how the country should navigate the challenges posed by global stablecoins. This move is notable given China's strict 2021 ban on the trading and mining of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It suggests Beijing is exploring the technology while remaining focused on maintaining financial stability and control.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 18:56:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted analysis from Goldman Sachs suggesting that investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively repurchase their own shares, even as the overall pace of buybacks has slowed. According to the analysis, a group of "buyback aristocrats"—companies that have consistently reduced their share counts over the past decade—are outperforming the broader market. Cramer noted that these generous buyback programs, such as those from Apple and Wells Fargo, can signal management's confidence in the company's future. This strategy of draining excess share supply from the system can provide an edge for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man sought by the NYPD in connection with a double murder in Queens has an extensive and violent criminal history, including a 2006 conviction for armed robbery and sexual assault. Authorities are searching for Jamel McGriff, 42, after an elderly couple, Frank and Maureen Olton, were found dead in their burned home. Police say surveillance video shows McGriff entering the home hours before the fire was reported. McGriff served 16 years in prison for a 2005 crime spree that involved robbing a man at knifepoint on a subway and sexually assaulting a store worker during another robbery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has allowed a lower court's decision to stand, effectively permitting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to conduct stops and detentions based on factors such as race, ethnicity, or speaking a language other than English. This action overturns an injunction from a California district court judge that had barred ICE from using such criteria. The case, Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, centers on whether these factors constitute reasonable suspicion. Civil rights advocates argue the practice violates the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and amounts to legalized racial profiling.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, is introducing legislation to prevent Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the January 6 Capitol riot, from receiving full military funeral honors. This move comes after the Pentagon reversed its initial decision and agreed to provide the honors. Gallego argues that Babbitt's actions, which included attempting to breach a barricaded door to where lawmakers were evacuating, constitute disqualifying conduct that would bring discredit upon the Air Force. He stated he will force a vote to put lawmakers on the record regarding whether they stand with what he termed a "traitor."</p>

Patel faces charges of making criminal threats, burglary, and violation of civil rights, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 13 years if convicted. The L.A.

The pledge targets institutions they see as "implicated in genocide and apartheid," while clarifying that it does not call for a boycott of Israeli individuals.

          <p>England delivered a commanding 5-0 victory against Serbia in their World Cup qualifier, providing manager Thomas Tuchel with his most impressive night since taking charge. The team's masterclass performance, achieved without key starters like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, silenced the hostile Belgrade crowd from the outset. Players such as Noni Madueke and Morgan Rogers excelled in their absence, staking strong claims for more regular inclusion. The decisive win not only puts England in a strong position for World Cup qualification but also presents Tuchel with a welcome headache of increased competition for starting positions.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire in California's Sierra National Forest has breached the McKinley Grove, a protected area containing ancient giant sequoia trees. The Garnet Fire has set some of the towering, 3,000-year-old trees ablaze in their canopies. In response, specialized wildland firefighters with tree-climbing skills are being deployed to combat the flames directly. To protect the majestic trees, crews are also implementing ground-level measures, including laying sprinkler lines, wrapping trunks in fire-resistant foil, and clearing away flammable materials. The intense blaze poses a significant threat to the beloved natural landmarks.</p>

Despite expressing his hatred for losing, he was impressed with how his much-changed team, which included three new caps, adapted to the challenge.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's handling of revelations from the Jeffrey Epstein estate is unusually defensive and is consequently backfiring. Unlike his typical strategy of brazenly confronting and dismissing scandals, Trump's repeated denials about signing documents for Epstein and his administration's evasive responses are fueling public intrigue and suspicion. The White House's insistence that the narrative is a "hoax" perpetuated by Democrats, rather than a direct confrontation of the evidence, only deepens the perception that there is something to hide. This un-Trumpian behavior has left his team struggling to control a narrative that continues to absorb public attention.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha is not just a military action but a direct challenge to Qatar's relevance as a central mediator in global conflicts. For years, Qatar cultivated its influence by serving as a neutral ground for opposing factions, from the U.S. and the Taliban to various Islamist groups. However, by striking on Qatari soil, Israel signals that it, and potentially its U.S. ally, now views the mediation process as a fruitless endeavor. This move undermines Qatar's carefully built status as an indispensable diplomatic player, suggesting a limit to its ability to host belligerent groups without consequence.</p>
