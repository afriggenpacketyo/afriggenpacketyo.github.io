            <p>Michigan health officials have confirmed the state's first measles outbreak since 2019, with three cases in Montcalm County, where vaccination rates are low. The state has reported a total of seven cases this year, contributing to a nationwide surge of over 700 measles cases across 24 states, the highest number since 2019. Health officials urge unvaccinated individuals to receive the MMR vaccine, which is highly effective in preventing measles, as the disease is extremely contagious and can spread rapidly among susceptible individuals. The CDC recommends two doses of the vaccine for optimal protection, highlighting the importance of vaccination in preventing outbreaks and protecting public health.</p>

            <p>A pilot project called SeaCURE has commenced operations on the south coast of England, aiming to extract carbon from seawater as a means to combat climate change. Funded by the UK government, the project explores the feasibility of removing carbon from the ocean, where it exists in higher concentrations than in the air. The process involves acidifying seawater to release dissolved carbon as CO2, concentrating it, and then returning the treated seawater to the ocean to absorb more CO2. While currently removing a small amount of CO2, the project aims to assess the potential for large-scale carbon removal from the world's oceans using renewable energy sources.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly has reported positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial for orforglipron, a once-daily oral GLP-1 pill for treating Type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss. The trial demonstrated that the pill effectively lowered A1C levels in adults with Type 2 diabetes and led to an average weight loss of 16 pounds at the highest dose. Common side effects included mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues, but the company plans to seek FDA approval for the drug as a diabetes treatment in 2026 and for weight management by the end of this year, with confidence in its ability to meet global demand.</p>

            <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates and expressing impatience for his term to end. Trump's remarks followed Powell's warnings about the potential economic consequences of the administration's trade policies, particularly tariffs, which could lead to stagflation. Trump pointed to the European Central Bank's rate cut as an example, while also claiming that the U.S. is benefiting from tariffs and that Powell is acting too late. Despite Trump's criticism, legal precedents and Powell's own statements suggest that the Fed chair cannot be easily removed from office.</p>

            <p>The CDC has reportedly scrapped plans to help curb measles in Texas schools due to staff layoffs, impacting the agency's response to this year's outbreak. The CDC had considered extending ventilation assessments, previously offered to hospitals, to schools as well, but staffing cuts have made this impossible. These assessments identified critical issues in hospitals, like incorrectly pressurized isolation rooms and improperly installed air filters. The layoffs also affect other NIOSH initiatives, such as health hazard evaluations for workplaces, highlighting the wide-ranging impact of these cuts on public health efforts.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike due to the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCOs), a role that was paid more than some other bin worker positions. The dispute centers on potential pay cuts for workers who may have to accept lower-paying positions as loaders, with the union claiming some could lose up to £8,000 per year. The council disputes this figure, estimating the maximum loss to be just over £6,000, but the union claims this back of the lorry role is "safety critical". A consultation on plans for compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on April 3.</p>

This data comes as Japan engages in trade talks with the U.S., facing potential tariffs on auto imports and steel. While a strong inflation figure could prompt the BOJ to raise interest rates, looming tariffs from the U.S. may exert downward pressure on Japan's GDP, potentially limiting the BOJ's room for rate hikes (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Tottenham Hotspur secured a 1-0 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, relieving some pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou, who had admitted uncertainty about his job security. The win advances Tottenham to a semi-final against Bodo/Glimt and offers a chance for their first trophy in 17 years. Postecoglou emphasized the team's unity and belief in their goals, dismissing external criticism and focusing on the players' faith in his leadership. Despite a disappointing Premier League season, Postecoglou remains optimistic about the team's potential and their opportunity for success.</p>

            <p>Mass firings are underway at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) following its takeover by the Department of Government Efficiency, with an estimated 1,400 to 1,500 employees expected to be terminated. Acting CFPB Director Russ Vought cited the need to restructure the Bureau's operations to better reflect the agency's priorities and mission as the reason for the cuts. Terminated employees will retain access to work systems until April 18, after which they will be placed on administrative leave through their official separation date of June 16, 2025. The CFPB regulates and enforces student loans and was established after the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers.</p>

He emphasized that advertising is a critical cost for companies and that Google's illegal monopoly has harmed the entire advertising ecosystem, including news publishers (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The FDA is reportedly planning to end most of its routine food safety inspections and outsource the oversight to state and local authorities, according to multiple federal health officials. The agency is considering the plan to free up resources for higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico. Under the plans, some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA. This is due to recent steep layoffs at the office's support staff, as well as increased numbers of inspections overseas.</p>
