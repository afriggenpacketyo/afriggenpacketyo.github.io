          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 13:19:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia is poised to announce its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with market expectations set for adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and revenue reaching $46.02 billion, representing a substantial 53% year-over-year increase. This remarkable growth is predominantly driven by the burgeoning demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) spurred by the generative artificial intelligence era, with the company's data center segment contributing significantly to total sales. Analysts will closely monitor updates on the performance of Nvidia's Blackwell chips and the evolving situation in the Chinese market, where export controls and a push for homegrown alternatives could impact future revenue. Despite these challenges, the company's projected fiscal third-quarter sales guidance remains strong, nearing $53 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

President Maia Sandu reiterated that EU membership is the only viable path for Moldova, particularly as its sovereignty and peace are increasingly challenged by external pressures. The leaders' unified message, delivered on Moldova's independence anniversary, reinforces the country's European aspirations amidst allegations of ongoing Russian hybrid attacks and efforts to influence its upcoming parliamentary elections.</p>

          <p>The recent engagement announcement between pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce has demonstrated the couple's considerable economic and cultural impact, influencing both the stock market and various brand strategies. Shares of Signet Jewelers experienced a notable increase, and Ralph Lauren also saw gains, with an analyst attributing this to Swift's apparent endorsement of the brand in engagement photos. Furthermore, American Eagle's stock climbed after revealing a collaboration with Kelce's Tru Kolors sportswear brand, highlighting the immediate commercial opportunities associated with the celebrity couple. This event reinforces Swift's established role as a powerful economic engine, previously evidenced by her "Eras" tour's significant boost to consumer spending, capturing the attention of financial institutions and the broader market.

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are experiencing substantial challenges in accessing accurate information and timely assistance from both the Department of Education and their assigned loan servicers, a situation exacerbated by recent, sweeping changes to the federal student loan system. Numerous individuals, including those awaiting updates on Public Service Loan Forgiveness applications, report receiving inconsistent guidance and facing extensive backlogs. These difficulties stem from a dramatic overhaul of repayment plans and new legislation, making it arduous for borrowers to navigate their accounts effectively. Experts recommend contacting the Federal Student Aid Information Center or their specific loan servicer during off-peak hours, or seeking support from non-profit organizations and state ombudsmen to address their concerns and avoid potential financial consequences.</p>

This move aims to deter the small minority of passengers who violate bag size limits, with the airline also removing the monthly cap on these earnings for staff. Separately, O'Leary expressed strong skepticism regarding the UK's sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate, calling SAF "nonsense" and stating there's "not a hope in hell" of meeting the 2030 target due to supply shortages. He believes sustainability targets for aviation are failing, anticipating falling oil prices over the next decade.</p>

          <p>An archaeological excavation in the Negev desert has brought to light remarkably preserved remnants of a 1,500-year-old Christian church, constructed by the ancient Nabataean civilization. Situated within the now-ruined oasis city of Mamshit, the site features surprisingly intact baptismal pools, including a distinct cross-shaped pool for adult baptisms and a smaller one for infants, illustrating the Nabataeans' adoption of Christianity from the 4th century A.D. This civilization, renowned for its extensive trade networks and iconic city of Petra, established such structures along its desert routes. The discovery offers a profound glimpse into the constant change experienced by people and societies, serving as a powerful testament to the impermanence of even the most enduring human endeavors.</p>

          <p>Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, vehemently denied charges of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Epping, Essex, telling Colchester Magistrates' Court, "I am not a wild animal." The prosecution alleges Kebatu made inappropriate comments, including "you would be a good wife," and later placed his hand on her thigh and attempted to kiss her. These accusations led to anti-immigration protests outside the hotel where Kebatu was residing. During his testimony, Kebatu, whose age is contested in court records, emphasized the victim's youth and expressed concern about the impact of the trial on his asylum claim and other migrants. The trial, which included testimony from witnesses who observed his behavior and the victim's account of feeling "sick to my stomach," has been adjourned until September 4.</p>

          <p>Democrat Catelin Drey achieved a notable victory in Iowa's state senate district 1, successfully flipping the seat from Republican control and thereby breaking the Republican supermajority in the state senate. Drey, a 37-year-old marketing executive, secured 55% of the vote against Christopher Prosch, who aligned with the "Maga" movement and espoused conspiracy theories. This outcome represents a significant shift in a district that had strongly supported Donald Trump in the previous year. Drey attributed her success to addressing voter frustrations regarding Iowa's economy and maternal healthcare, arguing that Republicans had failed the working class. This win, the second for Iowa Democrats in a special state senate election this year, signals a potential challenge for Republicans in upcoming midterm elections, reflecting a broader pattern of Democratic overperformance in such contests nationally.</p>

The inauguration was attended by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and German ministers, underscoring the facility's importance for European defense capabilities.

Best Buy, while having pulled forward some freight, demonstrates less reliance on China for its products compared to other retailers. Conversely, Five Below, despite a high exposure to Chinese tariffs, benefits from its flexible inventory model, allowing it to opportunistically source products. Industry experts anticipate tariffs will become a more pronounced challenge in the second half of the year, with larger, food-heavy retailers expected to absorb costs more effectively than those focused on general merchandise.

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a deceleration in sales growth during its fiscal second quarter, with sales for its core Abercrombie brand declining by 5%. Nevertheless, the company's overall sales increased by 7%, significantly bolstered by the exceptional performance of its Hollister brand, which recorded its highest-ever second-quarter net sales growth at 19%. Despite a tempered profit outlook for the current quarter, largely due to an anticipated $25 million in tariff costs, Abercrombie & Fitch has raised its full-year revenue forecast to a 5% to 7% growth range. The company is strategically focused on revitalizing the Abercrombie brand through the introduction of new categories like dresses and athleisure, international expansion, and high-profile partnerships, including a multi-year deal as the NFL's first "official fashion partner."

          <p>Tom Barrack, the U.S. special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey, provoked widespread outrage among the Lebanese press corps after admonishing journalists to "act civilized" and warning against "animalistic" behavior during a news conference in Beirut. Barrack's comments, delivered during a media scrum with a congressional delegation, were widely perceived as patronizing and reflective of a "19th-century colonial commissioner" mentality, leading to strong condemnations on social media. The office of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun issued an oblique statement of "regret," while the union of journalists demanded a public apology from Barrack and called for a boycott of his future press events. This diplomatic misstep occurs at a delicate juncture for U.S. policy in the region, as Washington endeavors to pressure the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in a civil trial, vehemently denying accusations that she physically assaulted security guard Emani Ellis in 2018 by scratching her cheek and spitting on her. Ellis is suing the artist, claiming the alleged altercation outside an obstetrician's office left her "deeply traumatized." Cardi B, whose legal name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, asserted that Ellis filmed and followed her without consent during a private pregnancy appointment, leading to a heated "verbal fight" but no physical contact on her part. Conversely, Ellis stated she did not film the rapper and was instead accused of attempting to leak news of her presence, which she claims escalated into the assault. A plastic surgeon provided testimony regarding treatment for a "hyper-sensitive" scar on Ellis's cheek, which he believed was "most likely" caused by fingernails.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, carries significant financial risks that can negatively impact long-term retirement income. Doing so results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, approximately 70% of the full amount, which also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, early claiming forfeits delayed retirement credits, which could increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, leading to a substantial difference over a 20-year retirement. This decision also impacts a surviving spouse's potential benefits. Strategies like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, or working part-time can help bridge the income gap, allowing individuals to delay claiming and maximize their Social Security.

This eye-catching piece aligns with a growing celebrity trend for large, distinctive stones and vintage-inspired designs, moving away from conventional engagement ring aesthetics. Jewellery experts highlight that while a general preference for bigger diamonds exists, celebrities often choose more extravagant and unique pieces to stand out. The article also delves into the rising popularity of lab-grown diamonds as a more accessible and often ethically appealing option for consumers, although the broader sustainability and ethical considerations surrounding both natural and lab-grown stones are presented as a nuanced discussion.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novartis has warned that NHS patients could lose access to innovative new treatments due to escalating costs and a breakdown in drug pricing negotiations with the UK government. Novartis's UK boss, Johan Kahlstrom, stated the UK market is "largely uninvestable" because of outdated assessment methods and a high rebate rate of 23.5% on drug sales, significantly higher than in other European countries. The firm claims it has already been unable to launch several medicines in the UK that are available elsewhere. The government, however, maintains it offered a "generous" deal, while the industry argues for changes to assessment methods and a more competitive environment to prevent further deprioritization of the UK market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, until at least early October, as his attorneys pursue an asylum claim. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to an El Salvadoran prison in March, despite a 2019 court order protecting him from removal due to fear of persecution. He was later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, then re-detained by ICE for potential deportation to Uganda. His legal team argues that his re-entry into the U.S. now makes him eligible to apply for asylum within one year. The judge's ruling mandates he remain in custody within a 200-mile radius of the court, allowing access to his legal counsel while his habeas petition and asylum request are deliberated.</p>

Rebecca Haro initially told authorities she was attacked in a Yucaipa parking lot and her child was abducted, but investigators found inconsistencies in her account, leading to their arrests. Authorities now believe Emmanuel is deceased and are actively engaged in a search to recover his remains, while his parents are being held on $1 million bail each.</p>

          <p>Forecasters are anticipating the probable return of La Niña this fall, with a 53% chance from September through November and a slightly higher 58% likelihood by year-end, prompting NOAA to issue a La Niña watch. This natural climate pattern, defined by cooler-than-average water temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, is expected to significantly influence the United States' temperature and precipitation patterns throughout the winter season. However, its projected weaker intensity suggests that other atmospheric phenomena could also play a role in shaping regional weather. Typically, a La Niña winter shifts the jet stream northward, leading to drier conditions across many southern states and increased precipitation in parts of the northern U.S., alongside generally warmer temperatures in the South and cooler conditions in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the sales slowdown to lower- and middle-income customers seeking less expensive brands, but detailed ongoing initiatives to correct past missteps, including reintroducing popular sections like petite, bringing back jewelry, and revising discount strategies.
