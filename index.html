          <p>McDonald's has exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for earnings and revenue, driven by successful promotions that led to a rebound in U.S. sales. Despite this positive performance, company executives expressed caution regarding the economic health of low-income consumers, who are a crucial part of their customer base. The company is exploring ways to offer more affordable menu items to re-engage this demographic, acknowledging that the overall U.S. consumer market remains challenging. The chain's international markets, particularly in Japan and China, showed even stronger same-store sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Air quality alerts are active in numerous states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois, with conditions rated as "moderate" to "unhealthy for sensitive groups." The federal Air Quality Index is being used to monitor the situation, which poses risks for individuals with heart or lung conditions, older adults, children, and pregnant women.

          <p>The leaders of Iran and Pakistan have agreed to significantly enhance their bilateral relationship, signing deals to increase trade to $10 billion and bolster security cooperation. This partnership aims to address mutual challenges from militant groups operating near their shared border, shifting towards intelligence-sharing and joint patrols. The article explores the geopolitical context, including Pakistan's balancing act between its support for Iran and its growing partnership with the United States. Despite potential friction, experts believe Pakistan is unlikely to become a military platform for hostile actions against Iran, positioning itself as a potential mediator.</p>

          <p>A top federal official in Mexico's Tamaulipas state, Ernesto Vásquez Reyna, was assassinated in broad daylight in the border city of Reynosa. Investigators believe the killing was retaliation by an organized crime group following a major seizure of stolen fuel in the region. The Gulf Cartel's "Metros" faction, which controls Reynosa, is heavily involved in fuel theft alongside drug trafficking and human smuggling. The violent attack underscores the persistent power of cartels and the dangers faced by officials working to combat them in areas close to the U.S. border.</p>

Having served in the Senate since 2019 and the House before that, she would be the first woman to serve as Tennessee's governor if elected. Her entry into the race sets up a primary contest against fellow Republican Representative John Rose.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new season of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following a misconduct investigation. Despite backlash and requests to cancel the series, the BBC proceeded, stating it was fair to the contestants who participated. The episodes appear to have been edited to minimize the hosts' banter and casual chat, focusing more on the cooking and judging. The decision has been met with criticism, with some former contestants and public figures stating they will not watch the show out of respect for those who came forward with complaints.</p>

          <p>A recent report by Checkr has ranked the 100 largest U.S. cities, identifying those with the weakest employment opportunities and earning potential. Cities such as Bakersfield, California; Scranton, Pennsylvania; and McAllen, Texas, scored lowest due to factors like slow job growth, high unemployment, and overreliance on declining industries. Many of the listed cities are in the Rust Belt or are heavily dependent on agriculture and energy sectors, which limits opportunities. The analysis indicates that even in cities with more jobs, wages often lag, and unemployment rates are significantly higher than the national average. (not investment advice)</p>

Temperatures are expected to reach 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), exacerbating a water crisis, with Tehran experiencing its lowest rainfall in 60 years. Experts attribute the crisis to decades of resource mismanagement, over-consumption, and policies that failed to account for the country's growing population and arid climate.

          <p>The accessories retailer Claire's has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. for the second time in seven years, citing debts between $1 billion and $10 billion. The company attributes the filing to a combination of increased competition, shifting consumer spending habits towards online shopping, and its significant debt obligations. The move also affects its Canadian operations, while its UK and French arms are exploring options including sales or insolvency. Stores are expected to remain open in the U.S. and Canada as the company explores strategic alternatives to restructure its business.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a pilot program requiring citizens of Malawi and Zambia to pay a refundable $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas. The stated aim of the 12-month program is to curb visa overstays from countries with high rates or where security vetting is considered insufficient. The deposit will be returned at the end of the visitor's stay in the U.S. This policy is one of several measures implemented by the Trump administration to tighten immigration controls and is expected to potentially expand to include citizens of other nations in the future.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's recent actions on artificial intelligence are undermining its own stated goal of achieving global AI dominance. The article points to the reversal of an export ban on advanced Nvidia H20 chips to China and deals to build AI data centers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. These moves, reportedly influenced by tech figures David Sacks and Jensen Huang, are seen as ceding a strategic advantage to rivals and placing critical infrastructure in a volatile region. Critics, including former administration officials, warn these decisions could endanger America's economic and military edge.</p>

          <p>A downbeat economic forecast from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) suggests the UK government faces a budget gap of £40-50 billion, significantly larger than previous estimates. This puts pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who may need to establish a larger buffer to meet borrowing rules, potentially requiring substantial tax rises or spending cuts. With most spending fixed, the article notes that potential levers include changes to VAT, pensions allowances, and prolonging the freeze on income tax thresholds. The analysis highlights the difficult strategic decisions awaiting the Treasury ahead of the autumn Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

According to football finance experts, the club is utilizing clever financing, such as spreading payments for recent signings over the length of player contracts. Additional funds have been generated from loaning out Marcus Rashford, receiving a fee from Chelsea for a canceled deal, and collecting on sell-on clauses for former players. While the club is not in as strong a financial position as some rivals, its massive commercial revenue allows for significant squad investment.</p>

Reich argues that this economic frustration created fertile ground for a demagogue to exploit.
