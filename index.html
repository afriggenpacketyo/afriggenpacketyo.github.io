        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision that a Louisiana law mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms and state-funded universities is unconstitutional. The court affirmed that the law violates the separation of church and state, citing concerns raised by a group of parents who sued the state. Louisiana's Attorney General Liz Murrill expressed strong disagreement with the ruling and plans to seek relief from the full Fifth Circuit and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, while similar laws are under consideration in other Republican-led states. This ruling honors the religious diversity and religious-freedom rights of public school families across Louisiana.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel's war in Gaza. The judge stated that Khalil is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, criticizing the government's case for detention. Khalil's arrest was widely condemned as an attack on free speech, and his release follows similar rulings for other detained student activists. Khalil's immigration case will proceed separately, with the government likely to continue arguing for his deportation based on alleged omissions in his green card application, despite setbacks in court. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, argue that prosecutors intentionally released Mangione's journal entries to bias the public and undermine his right to a fair trial. The defense claims the release of the journal, which included excerpts about Mangione's plans, was unnecessary and prejudicial, especially given potential issues with the legality of the search that yielded the journal. Mangione's attorneys are seeking to delay or dismiss the state case to focus on the federal prosecution, which could result in the death penalty. The defense argues that forcing Mangione to choose between asserting a state defense and giving the federal prosecution an advantage is untenable.</p>

          <p>This article is a satirical take on the lack of a uniform for ICE agents, humorously suggesting that the absence of clear identification allows agents to avoid accountability. It mocks the idea that ICE agents can dress in casual or confusing attire, making it difficult for people to recognize them as law enforcement officials. The piece uses irony and sarcasm to criticize the Trump administration's immigration policies and the tactics employed by ICE. It also references Coco Chanel's collaboration with the Nazis to highlight the potential for fashion to be used for nefarious purposes.</p>

The Daily Express frames the vote as a "victory" for campaigners and "dignity in dying," while The Daily Mirror notes the mixed reactions from supporters and opponents outside Parliament.

          <p>President Donald Trump has given Iran a two-week deadline to "come to their senses" and engage in diplomacy, while dismissing European efforts to mediate. This comes as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi concluded talks with European counterparts, reiterating Iran's demand for Israel to halt attacks before negotiations can proceed. Trump expressed skepticism about the talks and stated that Iran prefers to negotiate directly with the U.S., despite Iran's rebuff of previous offers. Meanwhile, sharp differences persist between Israeli and American assessments of Iran's nuclear capabilities, with Trump contradicting his own intelligence director's testimony.</p>

The grocery retailer did not specify which locations would be affected but stated that all employees at the closing stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations. The company expects the closures to provide a modest financial benefit, with savings being invested in customer experience initiatives. The announcement coincided with Kroger's first-quarter earnings report, which showed a slight decrease in sales compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Iran has stated that it will not resume talks over its nuclear program while under attack, following escalating exchanges of fire with Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, who urged him to revive diplomatic efforts with the U.S. Araghchi indicated that Iran is ready to consider diplomacy only once Israel's "aggression is stopped," asserting that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that Israel's attacks violate international law. President Trump suggested that Iran has a "maximum" of two weeks to avoid potential U.S. air strikes.</p>
