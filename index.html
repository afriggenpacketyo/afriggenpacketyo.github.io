            <p>Consumer sentiment experienced a significant decline in April, according to the University of Michigan survey, driven by escalating inflation expectations. The mid-month reading fell sharply to 50.8, signaling a substantial drop from March. Inflation expectations for the year ahead surged to 6.7%, the highest level since 1981, while the five-year outlook also increased. These figures highlight growing concerns among consumers about the persistent rise in prices and its impact on their economic well-being.</p>

            <p>Analysts estimate a 'Made in the USA' iPhone 16 Pro could cost significantly more than its current price of $1,199, potentially reaching $1,500 to $3,500 due to increased labor costs and tariffs on imported components. Apple currently manufactures over 80% of its products in China, benefiting from a large, skilled workforce and lower wages. Bringing iPhone production to the U.S. would require substantial investment in infrastructure and face challenges in finding a comparable workforce. TSMC has successfully started making chips in Arizona, but most attempts to move production to the US have failed, and the cost of a 'Made in the USA' iPhone would be too high. </p>

            <p>Over 1,300 Education Department employees received official notices that their positions are being abolished as part of President Trump's executive order to significantly reduce the agency. The notices, required 60 days before separation, inform employees that their separation is not based on performance but due to a reduction in positions.

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed concerns that the U.S. economy is nearing or already in a recession, citing weakening economic data and uncertainty caused by President Trump's widespread tariffs. He believes that the pausing of some tariffs for 90 days is insufficient to restore confidence. Fink's remarks follow BlackRock's mixed first-quarter financial results, where earnings per share exceeded expectations but revenue fell short. Despite recession concerns, Fink remains optimistic about long-term economic trends like artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari indicated that rising bond yields and a weakening U.S. dollar suggest investors are losing confidence in the U.S. as a safe investment haven.

Kashkari noted that these trends run counter to typical expectations during tariff increases, when the dollar would usually strengthen. While acknowledging market stresses, he doesn't see significant dislocations and remains focused on keeping inflation expectations stable. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Losing an Android phone can be frustrating, but several methods can help locate it. Smartwatches can ping the phone, making it ring even on silent. Google's 'Find My Device' feature, accessible through a Google account, can track the phone's location, make it ring, lock it, or erase its data. Retracing steps and contacting visited locations are also viable options. Security measures like keypad locks and biometric security are crucial to protect sensitive data if the phone falls into the wrong hands.</p>

The moves come amid Trump's attacks on DEI programs and law firms challenging him in court.

            <p>President Trump has implemented tariffs on goods from various countries, including up to 145% on Chinese goods, leading to a trade war. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, increasing costs for companies and potentially consumers. Trump argues tariffs will boost U.S. manufacturing and reduce trade deficits, but economists warn of potential price increases and economic disruption. The U.S. has a trade deficit with China, importing significantly more than it exports. These tariffs have caused volatility in global stock markets and could impact the UK economy as well.</p>
