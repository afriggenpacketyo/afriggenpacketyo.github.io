          <p>Over 200 individuals were arrested in London's Parliament Square for demonstrating support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw participants display signs with messages supporting the group, leading to mass arrests by the Metropolitan Police. This event occurs amidst legal challenges to the group's ban and a tense weekend with multiple planned demonstrations in the capital. The arrests highlight the ongoing conflict between free speech advocacy and national security measures concerning pro-Palestinian activism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a strong week, with the Nasdaq reaching a new record high, largely driven by Apple's performance. The tech giant's stock surged after it announced a $100 billion increase to its U.S. investment pledge, securing an exemption from new tariffs on semiconductor imports. The week's market movements were heavily influenced by tariff news, including a potential 25% increase on India's tariff rate. Despite positive earnings reports from many S&P 500 companies, some stocks like Eli Lilly faced significant losses due to specific company news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a preseason NFL game, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Xavier Legette and Cleveland Browns safety Rayshawn Jenkins were both ejected in the first quarter. The disqualifications occurred after the two players exchanged several punches on the field following a play. Panthers head coach Dave Canales acknowledged that while Legette was playing physically as instructed, throwing punches is unacceptable and both ejections were justified. Legette, a first-round draft pick, later issued an apology to fans on social media for his actions during his debut professional game.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly stated that Ukraine will not make any territorial concessions for peace, responding to suggestions that a land swap might be part of a deal. The meeting in Kent, reportedly called at the request of the U.S., underscores European and Ukrainian anxieties about being excluded from direct negotiations between Washington and Moscow that will shape the future of the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has detailed a proposed settlement for clergy sexual assault survivors that uses a point-based system to determine payouts. Under the plan, different forms of abuse are assigned specific point values, with an act of sexual assault worth 75 points, while being shown pornography is worth 10. The total monetary value of each point will only be known after all claims are assessed, creating uncertainty for the hundreds of survivors who must vote on the plan. The proposal, part of the archdiocese's bankruptcy case, has drawn criticism from some victims' attorneys who are urging a 'no' vote.</p>

This move comes after Trump ramped up his rhetoric on D.C. crime and threatened to federalize the city if local officials did not act. The White House initiated a seven-day crackdown, which local officials have condemned as an overreach and an encroachment on the district's 'home rule.' The president claims the federal intervention will soon make D.C. one of the safest cities.</p>

          <p>The four-person crew of NASA's Crew-10 mission has successfully returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean after a nearly five-month stay aboard the International Space Station. The team, comprising astronauts from NASA, JAXA, and Roscosmos, conducted over 200 science experiments aimed at preparing for future human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Their return marks the 12th successful crewed mission to the ISS by SpaceX under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The crew's replacements, Crew-11, arrived at the station last week to continue the ongoing scientific work on the orbiting laboratory.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers and halt anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, a key step by new President Lee Jae Myung's administration to de-escalate tensions. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which involved blasting K-pop and critical news from the South and unsettling noises from the North, had recently intensified. While this marks a potential thaw, relations remain tense as the U.S. and South Korea prepare for their annual joint military exercises later this month.</p>

In a new book, he suggests that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, closer to 4.7% or even higher for current retirees. Bengen argues that many people are too conservative and don't spend enough in retirement, failing to enjoy their accumulated wealth.

          <p>In a humorous turn of events during a scientific experiment, a robot crab named 'Wavy Dave' was destroyed by the very creatures it was designed to study. Researchers deployed the 3D-printed, remote-controlled robot in Portugal to observe the mating rituals of male fiddler crabs. Initially, the real crabs were wary, but after females seemed to reject the robot, some males confronted it. One aggressive male crab ultimately tore off the robot's waving claw, forcing the scientists to abandon the trial, but not before gathering valuable data on competitive signaling behavior in the species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, asserts that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle can be explained by simple probability and natural phenomena, not supernatural causes. He argues that given the high volume of ship and plane traffic in the area, the number of disappearances is not statistically unusual compared to other well-traveled parts of the ocean. This explanation aligns with the long-held positions of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the insurance market Lloyd's of London. They attribute the incidents to factors like volatile weather from the Gulf Stream, complex navigation, and human error.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, August 15. The announcement comes as a deadline set by Trump for Putin to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine passed, with uncertainty remaining about potential U.S. sanctions. Trump suggested that any peace deal could involve a 'swapping of territories' between Russia and Ukraine to achieve a resolution. The planned summit marks a significant diplomatic development, as Trump seeks to broker an end to the war he has previously claimed he could resolve within 24 hours.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins argues that parents' own phone habits are a key factor in their children's overuse of screens, which can hinder their development into successful adults. Speaking at a panel, Robbins shared her personal experience of realizing her children were mirroring her constant phone use. She advises parents to model 'phone-life balance' by creating physical distance from their devices and engaging with their kids about their online activities with curiosity rather than judgment. Psychologists note that excessive screen time can negatively impact sleep, mental health, and cognitive functions like attention and decision-making.</p>

          <p>The execution of Byron Black, a 69-year-old intellectually disabled man, in Tennessee was reportedly fraught with complications, leading to what witnesses described as a 'horribly wrong' and torturous process. After staff struggled to insert IVs, Black was observed groaning in agony and stating 'It hurts so bad' for several minutes after the lethal injection began. Black's case was controversial due to a legal loophole that prevented his intellectual disability, conceded by the state under new laws, from halting his execution. The incident has intensified scrutiny over the methods and legality of capital punishment in the United States.</p>

          <p>According to a recent Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025, a decrease from last year's $2.5 million benchmark. However, this figure varies significantly by region, with residents in the West citing a need for $3 million, compared to $1.8 million in the South. Despite the lower national benchmark, nearly two-thirds of respondents feel that achieving wealth is harder due to inflation and economic uncertainty. The survey also found that the threshold for feeling 'financially comfortable' is much lower, averaging $839,000 nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a surprising rebirth by replacing defunct anchor stores with unconventional tenants, shifting from pure retail to community and entertainment hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people to the property weekly. Other malls are filling vacancies with tenants like The Cheesecake Factory, Dave & Buster's, and even expanding Barnes & Noble locations. This strategy of subdividing large spaces for a diverse mix of businesses is increasing foot traffic and creating new 'cross-shopping' opportunities, revitalizing these suburban staples.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager experienced debilitating symptoms for months, including severe headaches and memory loss. When physical therapy and medication failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed a rare and dangerous condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The AVM was likely the true cause of his long-term symptoms. The teen underwent successful brain surgery to remove the malformation and is now recovering, raising awareness about the importance of advanced imaging for persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to get sick and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and a recent state audit point to a lack of enforcement by the state's occupational health and safety agency, Cal/OSHA, as a primary cause. A review of recent heat deaths on farms found cases where few or no penalties were issued. The problem is compounded by the fact that many farmworkers are undocumented and fear retaliation if they complain about unsafe working conditions, especially amid increased immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA analyst who played a pivotal role in unmasking one of the most damaging spies in U.S. history, has died at age 79. In 1991, Grimes agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were disappearing, leading her to suspect fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames. By meticulously scrutinizing financial records and activity logs, she uncovered a pattern linking Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits. Her crucial work led to the 1994 arrest of Ames, who had compromised numerous operations and caused immense damage to national security.</p>
