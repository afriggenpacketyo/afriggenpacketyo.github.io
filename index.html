          <p>An investigation reveals that Western-made high-tech components, such as microchips and sensors, continue to be found in Russian drones and missiles used against Ukraine, despite extensive international sanctions. The article explores the complex supply chains and intermediary countries, like China and the UAE, that allow these dual-use goods to reach Russia. Experts suggest that while sanctions have increased costs and caused delays for Russia, they have not completely cut off access to critical technology.

          <p>Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) are pushing to make verbal sexual harassment, or "catcalling," a criminal offense, arguing that current insult laws are insufficient. The debate centers on closing a perceived legal loophole for non-physical but substantial harassment that disproportionately affects young women. While proponents argue it is a form of violence that restricts women's freedom in public spaces, opponents from other political parties have raised concerns about practicality.

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers highlights a significant mismatch between the country's fertility support policies and actual birth rates at the local level. The report found that Guangdong, the province with the highest number of newborns, ironically offers one of the least supportive environments for childbirth. This discrepancy suggests that current financial incentives and other support measures may not be effectively influencing families' decisions to have children. The authors call for more in-depth research to create a more scientific basis for policymaking aimed at boosting the nation's declining birth rate.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after Lecornu submitted his resignation. The move comes amid a period of significant political instability in France following a snap election that left no single party with a clear majority. Lecornu's reappointment is an attempt to end the political crisis and form a government capable of passing a budget. The decision was met with criticism from opposition parties on both the far-right and far-left, who continue to call for further political changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what he described as a "semiannual physical," six months after his last annual checkup. The White House stated the visit was a routine follow-up evaluation, which included advanced imaging and lab tests. A summary from the president's doctor declared him to be in "exceptional health" and noted his cardiac age was 14 years younger than his chronological age. The visit comes as the 79-year-old president prepares for an upcoming trip to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of anti-China demonstrations in Seoul is threatening to undermine South Korea's efforts to improve relations with Beijing. The protests, stemming from lingering resentment over past economic measures and conservative political sentiment, have gained enough prominence to prompt a warning from Beijing to Chinese tourists. This public backlash presents a significant challenge for South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who is perceived as more friendly toward Beijing than his predecessor. The tensions emerge at a critical time, just before the APEC summit where a visit from China's president is anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has started laying off federal workers as the U.S. government shutdown appears set to enter its third week. The White House budget office announced that "reduction in force" (RIF) notices have been sent to over 4,000 employees across seven agencies, including the Departments of Treasury and Health and Human Services. The move is seen as an attempt to pressure Democrats to end the funding standoff. Federal employee unions have condemned the layoffs as illegal and are challenging them in court, arguing they will have devastating effects on public services. (not investment advice)</p>
