          <p>Californians are preparing for the year's most intense heatwave, with temperatures expected to exceed 110°F in some areas. The National Weather Service has issued multiple advisories, highlighting risks to public health, especially for vulnerable populations, and an increased danger of wildfires due to the dry conditions. This extreme weather event is compounded by potential thunderstorms, and Governor Gavin Newsom has pre-deployed emergency resources to high-risk areas in anticipation of the combined threats. The sustained overnight warmth is a particular concern, offering little relief and complicating firefighting efforts.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has sent Lieutenant Governor Jay Collins to California to extradite Harjinder Singh, an undocumented immigrant accused of killing three people in a vehicular accident. Singh allegedly fled to California, a sanctuary state, after causing the fatal crash on the Florida Turnpike by making an illegal U-turn with his semi-truck. DeSantis stated that fleeing to a sanctuary jurisdiction will not prevent the suspect from facing justice in Florida. The move highlights the ongoing political tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and sanctuary state policies.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has announced a significant overhaul of her office, dubbed “ODNI 2.0,” which will involve cutting nearly half of its workforce. The restructuring also includes the consolidation of several intelligence centers. Officials state this is the largest reform since the office's creation post-9/11 and is intended to refocus the ODNI on its core mission of integrating and overseeing the intelligence community.

          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to a 10-month low, many potential homebuyers, particularly first-timers, remain on the sidelines due to persistently high home prices and overall market uncertainty. A significant undersupply of housing contributes to the affordability crisis, with the median age of first-time buyers now at an all-time high of 38. Many prospective buyers are waiting for both prices and interest rates to fall further before entering the market. This hesitation reflects a broader anxiety about the economy and the long-term financial commitment of homeownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>John Hume, an 83-year-old high-profile animal breeder, has been arrested in South Africa for allegedly running an international rhino horn smuggling network. Hume, who once owned one of the world's largest private rhino herds, is accused along with five others of illegally exporting over 900 rhino horns valued at more than $14 million. Investigators claim the scheme involved using fraudulent domestic sales permits to ship the horns to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The arrests followed a complex, multi-year investigation into the transnational trafficking operation.</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives has begun debating a contentious Republican-led bill to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move that could shift up to five seats to the GOP. The debate follows a two-week walkout by Democratic legislators who fled the state to deny a quorum and block the vote. Democrats argue the plan is a partisan gerrymander that illegally discriminates against minority voters, while Republicans contend it is a legal maneuver based on political performance. The tense session highlights the deep partisan divisions over voting rights and political power in the state.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's third attempt to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex-trafficking case. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman criticized the move as a "diversion," noting the government possesses over 100,000 pages of Epstein files, compared to the roughly 70 pages of grand jury material. The judge also cited potential threats to victims' safety and privacy as a reason for the denial.

The summary highlighted uncertainty about the effects of President Trump's tariffs and noted that while inflation was seen as the primary risk, some members viewed downside risks to employment as more salient.

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following allegations of mortgage fraud made by a Trump-appointed official. Bill Pulte, director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Cook of falsifying records to designate two separate properties as her primary residence to secure more favorable loan terms. The demand comes as Trump continues to pressure the Fed for interest rate cuts. Cook is a voting member of the committee that sets interest rates, and her potential departure could alter its composition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ernesto Barajas, a singer for the popular musical group Enigma Norteno, was shot and killed in a parking lot in Zapopan, Jalisco. His group is well-known for performing "narco-corridos," a musical sub-genre that glorifies the activities of drug cartels, including songs dedicated to leaders of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman. Barajas is the latest of several performers in this genre to be murdered in recent months, highlighting the dangers faced by artists who become entangled in cartel rivalries.

          <p>A California-based startup, Civ Robotics, has developed a four-wheeled robot called CivDot that is changing how solar farms are built. The robot automates the meticulous process of surveying and marking thousands of points on the ground, a task that is labor-intensive and time-consuming when done manually. Capable of marking up to 3,000 points per day with high precision, the CivDot can operate on rugged terrain and in rough weather, significantly increasing efficiency. This innovation is helping to accelerate the construction of renewable energy projects even as government support for them has pulled back.</p>

President Trump stated that the agency will distribute less aid and that it will come directly from the president's office, placing a greater financial burden on state and local governments. This policy change is raising concerns in disaster-prone areas, such as North Carolina, which received only a fraction of the necessary funds after Hurricane Helene. Critics worry that local governments lack the resources to manage recovery efforts without robust federal support.</p>

Its appearance underscores China's rapid advancement in next-generation air combat technology, which includes multiple stealth aircraft and drone projects.
