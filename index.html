          <p>In response to recent tariff escalations from the U.S., China has expressed confidence in its ability to withstand economic pressure and has signaled its readiness to employ various policy tools to stabilize market sentiment. The Communist Party's official newspaper asserted that China had anticipated this economic suppression and prepared contingency plans, including potential rate cuts and increased fiscal spending. Beijing has already committed to raising expenditures by increasing the official fiscal deficit ratio and expanding special bonds. Future policies will focus on supporting consumption, the stock market, and sectors most affected by U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced significant turmoil due to fears of a tariff-induced recession, with Asian indexes plummeting. Despite this, President Trump remained nonchalant, likening the tariffs to necessary "medicine." Senior Trump officials gave conflicting messages regarding the tariffs, provoking dissent within the Republican party. Separately, an internal investigation revealed how Trump's national security advisor inadvertently added the Atlantic's editor to a Signal group chat discussing potential strikes in Yemen. This incident highlights a series of missteps within the White House communication channels.</p>

          <p>The venture capital industry is experiencing significant churn at the senior level, with many top-level executives leaving legacy firms. This trend is driven by a perception that decision-making at large firms is slow and that funds are focused on managing large pools of money rather than working with promising founders. Some investors are capitalizing on changes in the industry by leaving big firms for the benefits of smaller ones, where they can have more control over their decisions. The rise of technology platforms like AngelList and Carta has also made it easier for individuals to start their own venture capital funds. (not investment advice)</p>

If S&P futures are down 7% between 6 p.m. ET and 9:30 a.m. ET, trading is halted until buyers emerge.

          <p>Democrats have criticized President Trump for spending the weekend golfing while markets experienced significant declines due to his sweeping tariffs. They argued that Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of concern for Americans' financial anxieties. Sen. Adam Schiff stated that the image of Trump golfing while people's retirement savings are in flames may be the most enduring image of his presidency. Trump encouraged Americans to "HANG TOUGH" in a post on his Truth Social platform, claiming it was an economic revolution.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs will lead to a recession. Futures tied to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped significantly, reaching the lowest level since April 2021. The mounting worries are that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which could slow down economic activity and ultimately hurt demand for oil. The drop in oil prices reflects growing anxiety about the potential economic impact of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations on car firms as they transition to electric vehicle production, ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that the government is committed to the 2030 deadline but will provide more flexibility to manufacturers to protect and create jobs. The changes include reducing non-compliance fines and allowing smaller firms to continue making petrol cars beyond the deadline. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improvements to charging infrastructure.</p>
