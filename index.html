          <h2>Southwest Airlines Reports Profit Decline Amid Domestic Travel Weakness, Citing Stabilized Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:03:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's estimates, causing its shares to decline by approximately 9%. The airline cited ongoing weakness in domestic travel demand and increased discounting as primary factors, leading to a decision to cut flights during off-peak periods. Despite these challenges, CEO Bob Jordan indicated that travel demand has recently stabilized, a sentiment echoed by other major carriers. In response, Southwest announced a new $2 billion share buyback and is implementing significant changes to its business model, including a move from open seating to assigned seats and new boarding procedures, aiming to enhance pricing power and operational efficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mexican authorities have achieved a significant victory, dismantling a major criminal extortion ring with ties to a powerful drug cartel operating in the State of Mexico. This historic crackdown, named Operation "Liberacion," involved nearly 3,000 security personnel and 52 raids, resulting in eight arrests of alleged gang leaders. The group had extensively extorted companies and individuals across 14 municipalities, controlling labor unions in key industries like construction and agriculture. This decisive action, which also led to the seizure of exotic animals and numerous vehicles, marks Mexico's largest operation against extortion gangs and underscores the government's urgent commitment to protecting the local economy and public safety.</p>

          <h2>American Airlines Lowers 2025 Profit Outlook Following Disappointing Third-Quarter Forecast</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines experienced a significant share slump after its third-quarter profit forecast missed Wall Street expectations, leading to a substantially lowered 2025 financial outlook compared to earlier projections. CEO Robert Isom cited ongoing consumer weakness, stagnant corporate travel demand, and operational issues from recent storms as key drivers for the revised outlook. While the airline's international segment shows resilience, domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile has seen a notable decline. American is now scaling back its capacity growth, aligning with broader industry trends where other major carriers have also adjusted their forecasts amidst economic uncertainty, underscoring a cautious outlook for the domestic travel market.</p>

          <p>Slovenia, a small nation of just over two million people, has become a surprising powerhouse in sports, producing elite athletes like Tour de France star Tadej Pogacar. This success is largely attributed to a robust national system that prioritizes physical education and talent development from an early age. Professor Gregor Jurak points to highly qualified PE teachers, small class sizes, and excellent school sports facilities as foundational elements. The long-running SLOfit program, which monitors children's physical and motor development, also helps identify and nurture promising young athletes. This comprehensive approach, alongside a diverse geography and a less commercialized sports culture, creates an environment where natural talent can truly flourish, boosting the nation's self-esteem on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of California San Francisco offers promising insights into Alzheimer's treatment, suggesting two existing cancer drugs, letrozole and irinotecan, could potentially slow or even reverse its effects. Researchers used computational tools to identify these FDA-approved medications by analyzing gene expression changes in brain cells affected by Alzheimer's. In mouse models, a combination of these drugs led to a reversal of the disease's gene expression changes, a reduction in tau protein clumps, and improvements in learning and memory. Despite these encouraging results, the study highlights limitations such as the use of animal models and plans for swift translation into human clinical trials, offering hope for millions affected by the disease.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for a more balanced trade relationship with China, highlighting the EU's growing trade deficit during the 25th EU-China summit. She stressed the need for fair competition, flagging issues such as China's industrial overcapacity, market access barriers, and export controls on rare earths. Von der Leyen warned that without progress on these concerns, maintaining the EU's current level of openness would be difficult. While Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized mutual benefit and deepened ties, the summit underscored persistent strains over trade imbalances and China's stance on the Ukraine war, complicating relations between Beijing and Brussels.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is preparing for an unprecedented mass recall vote on Saturday, targeting dozens of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers accused by critics of being "pro-Communist" and beholden to Beijing. This civic-led movement emerged from legislative deadlock since the last general election and controversial bills passed by the KMT-Taiwan People's Party coalition, which critics argue could undermine Taiwan's democracy. The recall campaigns have gained significant traction amid China's escalating military exercises around the island, with proponents framing it as an effort to "resist China, protect Taiwan." While success could potentially shift the legislative balance, the process highlights deep political divisions within Taiwan, complicating its unified response to external pressures.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House, aiming to significantly ease the financing process for accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as backyard tiny homes or granny flats. The proposed legislation would authorize FHA insurance for second mortgages specifically for ADU construction, and allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase and securitize these loans. This addresses a major financing barrier that currently restricts many lower- and middle-income homeowners from building ADUs. The initiative seeks to alleviate the nation's severe housing shortage and offer homeowners a source of rental income. While a crucial step, the bill does not alter restrictive local zoning laws, which remain a primary hurdle to widespread ADU development.</p>

          <p>This article contends that China is intentionally leveraging its role as the world's largest supplier of fentanyl precursor chemicals as a geopolitical tool against the United States, hindering efforts to combat the opioid crisis. Despite demonstrating the capacity to suppress illicit trade, China's criminal networks now primarily ship precursors to Mexican cartels, often providing manufacturing instructions. While Beijing maintains fentanyl is a U.S. problem, its cooperation on this issue has been erratic, directly influenced by the state of U.S.-China relations. The author suggests that China is strategically withholding full assistance to extract concessions from Washington, prioritizing its narrow self-interest over global public health and the tragic loss of American lives.</p>

          <p>A significant study published in The Lancet Public Health indicates that walking just 7,000 steps daily can substantially enhance brainpower and provide protection against a range of diseases. This comprehensive research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults globally, found that achieving 7,000 steps was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease by 25%, cancer by 6%, dementia by 38%, and depression by 22%. The findings suggest this figure is a more realistic and evidence-based target than the widely promoted 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign. Even modest increases in activity, starting from 4,000 steps, offer notable health improvements, encouraging wider adoption of daily physical activity.</p>

          <p>The article criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hour-long interview on the "Full Send Podcast" with the Nelk Boys, calling it "inane" and tone-deaf amidst the severe starvation crisis in Gaza. While nearly 100,000 women and children suffer from malnutrition, Netanyahu engaged in lighthearted banter, including jokes about fast food, and delivered unchallenged propaganda. The author condemns the podcast's hosts for their lack of journalistic rigor and for providing a platform to a leader facing an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for war crimes. This normalization of Netanyahu, the article argues, highlights a broader media failure to critically address the humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

This insecurity manifests differently for privileged citizens versus marginalized groups, who face more direct perils like detention and funding cuts based on identity.

They argue the organization has not effectively defended states' rights in the current political climate, questioning its value.

          <p>Turkey's central bank has cut its key interest rate by three percentage points to 43%, marking a return to monetary easing after an unexpected hike in April. This decision, which surprised many analysts who anticipated a smaller cut, signals the bank's confidence in its efforts to tackle inflation, which has been steadily decreasing. While the bank stated that tight monetary policy would continue to support disinflation, some strategists criticized the move as too dovish and indicative of a lack of independence. The central bank's actions aim to moderate domestic demand and appreciate the Turkish lira, but questions remain about its ability to reach ambitious inflation targets. (not investment advice)</p>
