MPs are advocating for a statutory duty to safeguard vulnerable claimants and rebuild trust in the system.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" (PFAS) in drinking water, while maintaining standards for two common types, PFOA and PFOS. The EPA will scrap and reconsider limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, and a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS. The agency will give utilities two extra years, until 2031, to comply with standards for PFOA and PFOS. The decision aligns with arguments made by water utilities, who sued the EPA over the costs of treatment systems.</p>
