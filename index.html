          <p>CoreWeave's CEO, Michael Intrator, addressed concerns about the company's significant capital expenditure plans, projecting $20 billion to $23 billion for the year, driven by a recent deal with OpenAI. During an interview with CNBC, Intrator clarified that these expenditures are in response to strong demand signals from major clients who require infrastructure at an accelerated pace. He also reassured investors that financing remains robust, with lenders confident in CoreWeave's ability to repay debts based on existing contracts. Some investors have expressed worries about CoreWeave's debt levels and the long-term sustainability of demand for its AI server rental services.</p>

Murdaugh's legal team had previously accused Hill of witness tampering, claims she denied, and her arrest has renewed scrutiny of the judicial process.

          <p>Frank Bruni's New York Times opinion piece discusses the rising influence of Laura Loomer within the MAGA movement and the potential trouble this poses for Donald Trump. Loomer, known for her provocations and conspiracy theories, has gained Trump's favor, but her infighting and extreme views could alienate other Republicans. Bruni argues that Trump's reliance on such figures, who prioritize audacity over sound ideas, undermines his ability to govern effectively. The article also touches on the broader divisions within the Republican party and the challenges Trump faces in maintaining unity.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, David Brooks explores the intense competition and constant rejection faced by young people today, particularly those at elite schools. He argues that this generation is the 'most rejected' due to low acceptance rates at universities, competitive internship programs, and a difficult job market. This culture of exclusion can lead to increased stress, a focus on security over passion, and a tendency to prioritize early specialization. The article suggests that this environment may be negatively impacting the mental health and overall well-being of young adults.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police are investigating the discovery of two "mutilated" kittens in Ickenham, west London, and are seeking to identify two teenagers seen on CCTV near the scene. The kittens were reportedly "tortured and dismembered," prompting serious concern in the local community. Police have released CCTV footage of the teenagers and an image of a duffel bag believed to have been used to carry the kittens. The investigation follows other recent attacks on animals in the area, though police believe these incidents are isolated.</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to drinking water, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing a bill that prohibits any additives to public water systems. This decision goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who assert that fluoridation prevents tooth decay, especially in children. However, the move aligns with the views of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, who claim that fluoride affects children's intellectual abilities. The law will take effect on July 1.</p>

Experts caution that eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the long-term fiscal outlook of both Social Security and Medicare.
