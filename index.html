          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a US economic 'golden age' faces early challenges as GDP shrank in the first quarter, impacted by trade distortions and weakened consumer spending. The article highlights Trump's attempts to deflect blame onto Joe Biden while taking credit for positive reports, creating confusion about the economy's true state. Experts suggest that the erratic rollout of tariffs has introduced uncertainty, affecting business investment and consumer confidence. Despite Trump's efforts to reassure voters, particularly in rural areas and lower-income households, polling indicates growing apprehension about his handling of the economy. Optimism Score: 40</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic anxieties and a changing global landscape, with inflation and housing affordability being key concerns. Voters express dissatisfaction with the limited measures proposed by major parties to address these issues, while both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton focus on traditional campaign themes like healthcare and tax cuts. The article also touches on the cultural divides exposed by a failed referendum on Indigenous rights and the potential impact of Trumpian politics on the Australian electorate.

          <p>Over 80 people have died in Syria following violence that began with an audio recording deemed blasphemous and resulted in attacks on Druze communities. The article details how unidentified armed groups targeted Druze-majority towns, leading to clashes with local armed men and the intervention of Syrian government forces. The Druze community, a religious minority, is divided on how to integrate into Syria's transitional government, with some seeking independence and others open to collaboration. Israel's military actions in Syria, framed as protecting the Druze, are viewed by some as exacerbating the situation and fueling negative perceptions of the Druze community. Optimism Score: 25</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snake species, offering a potential path to a universal antivenom. The current antivenom production method involves injecting small doses of venom into animals, but Friede's case offers a more broadly neutralizing approach. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in his blood that target common neurotoxin classes, creating a cocktail that protected mice from lethal doses of multiple venomous snake species.

          <p>Taiwan's National Palace Museum is experiencing a decline in tourist numbers due to strained relations with mainland China.

The museum director aims to attract 3.5 million visitors in 2025, but this goal faces challenges due to political factors and changing tourism policies.

          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision, disrupting plans for a Garcia-Haney rematch, in a boxing match where Garcia appeared tentative after an early knockdown. Haney, in a separate fight, secured a win against JosÃ© RamÃ­rez, but Garcia's loss casts doubt on the highly anticipated rematch.

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods has impacted Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms, cutting into advertising revenue.

President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting these companies to tariffs as high as 145 percent.
