          <p>Las Vegas police responded to a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, near the Bellagio Hotel & Casino, but authorities confirmed the incident did not occur inside a casino. Homicide detectives are investigating the shooting on the 3600 block of S. Las Vegas Boulevard, and the police urged the public to avoid the area. The investigation is ongoing, and further details are expected to be released as they become available. This incident adds to concerns about safety and security in popular tourist destinations, but police are working to ensure public safety. The situation remains under investigation as authorities work to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting.

          <p>A British news photographer, Nick Stern, underwent emergency surgery after being struck by a non-lethal bullet while covering protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles. Stern was documenting a standoff between police and protesters when he was hit in the thigh with what he described as a three-inch "plastic bullet." Despite his injury, Stern expressed his eagerness to return to work, emphasizing the importance of documenting the ongoing events. The protests were sparked by President Trump's promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, leading to increased ICE activity and community tensions.

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, amidst a bitter pay dispute that previously led to strikes. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer as inadequate, potentially leading to further strike action. The government claims the pay rise will bring new starter nurses' salaries above Â£30,000 for the first time. The vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, with the possibility of another round of industrial action looming, with other health unions also organizing votes on pay awards.

          <p>ICE is initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings, targeting those in the U.S. for less than two years, with the goal of expediting deportations. This initiative aims to have immigration cases dropped, placing migrants into expedited removal proceedings, but requires the cooperation of immigration judges. Critics argue this approach will deter migrants from attending hearings and targets those without criminal histories beyond illegal entry. The administration defends the strategy as a reversal of Biden's policies, enforcing existing laws regarding expedited removals, while immigration attorneys express concern that this will target those trying to legally seek citizenship. The optimism score is reflective of the fact that this is a governmental policy and thus there is relative stability. </p>

          <p>The NHS is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address a "challenging" blood shortage, aiming to increase the number of regular donors to over one million. Supplies have been low, prompting an "amber alert" last year, with a critical need for O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHSBT is particularly emphasizing the need for more black donors, who are more likely to have blood types that can treat sickle cell disease. Only a small percentage of the population donates regularly, and while registrations increased in 2024, only a quarter of those registered actually donated.

The policy cites the need to protect the U.S. from "foreign terrorists" and concerns about countries not providing sufficient information on their nationals. Certain exemptions are included, such as Green Card holders, dual nationals with a U.S. passport, and close relatives of U.S. citizens. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and has political and economic motivations, while human rights groups condemn it for limiting access to protection programs for refugees and asylum-seekers.

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating weak domestic consumption despite Beijing's stimulus measures, with price wars in the auto sector exacerbating the downward pressure. The consumer price index dropped 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices also declined, marking the steepest drop since July 2023. Experts emphasize the need for more forceful and targeted stimulus to boost consumption, as falling property prices and intense competition contribute to the deflationary trend. Despite a preliminary trade deal with the U.S., tensions remain, and markets are watching for further monetary easing measures from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced their sharpest drop in over five years, declining by more than 34% in May, as the effects of prohibitive tariffs took hold. Overall exports rose 4.8% year-on-year, but imports plunged 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. The decline in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Despite a temporary trade truce, tensions persist, with China tightening export controls on critical minerals and volumes of cars and ship exports jumping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel intercepted a Gaza-bound aid ship carrying Greta Thunberg, preventing it from reaching its destination.
