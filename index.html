        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a significant decrease in shipments to the U.S., with analysts suggesting the impact of the Beijing-Washington trade agreement will be evident in June's data. Specifically, Chinese exports to the U.S. plummeted by 34.5% compared to the previous year, marking the most substantial drop since February 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global trade. While overall exports saw a modest increase of 4.8%, imports declined by 3.4%, attributed to sluggish domestic demand, though shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa saw substantial increases.

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles saw National Guard troops deployed following clashes between law enforcement and protesters, sparked by immigration enforcement operations. Protests escalated, leading to multiple arrests and injuries, with demonstrators blocking freeways and vandalizing vehicles, including setting Waymo cars on fire. The deployment of the National Guard was criticized by California's Governor Newsom and L.A. Mayor Bass, who viewed it as an inflammatory measure. Federal officials defended the operations, stating they resulted in arrests of individuals including a "domestic abuser" and a "child sexual assaulter," while ICE criticized local politicians for allegedly misrepresenting the situation.</p>

Polish military officials later reported that the threat of Russian strikes had diminished, leading to the return of Polish and allied warplanes to their normal operations, and they confirmed no violation of Polish airspace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has proposed an extension to the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, in its waters. The proposal aims to expand the prohibited area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 within the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. The proposed extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas, seeking to safeguard rare marine species and their habitats, with a 12-week consultation period for industry input.</p>

          <p>China's export growth experienced a slowdown in May, reaching a three-month low due to decreased shipments to the United States following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Exports increased by 4.8% year-on-year, but this was a decrease from April's 8.1%, with exports to the U.S. falling nearly 12% from April to May. These figures were released just hours before another round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in London.

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho, a record-breaking sumo wrestler, plans to promote the sport from outside the Japan Sumo Association. Hakuho's retirement from the association was formalized following the closure of his Miyagino stable due to an abuse scandal involving his protege, Hokuseiho. At a press conference, Hakuho expressed his desire to develop sumo from an external perspective and focus on projects to spread sumo globally. Despite his departure, Hakuho will be remembered as one of the sport's all-time greats, having won 1,187 matches during his career.</p>

          <p>Recent events in Los Angeles, including immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard, have raised concerns about the emergence of a police state under President Trump. Federal agents have conducted raids across the city, leading to clashes with protesters and escalating tensions. Critics argue that Trump's actions, including the deployment of federal forces and the bypassing of local authorities, are creating an infrastructure that could be used against any segment of the population. The situation has prompted widespread protests and calls for resistance against what some see as authoritarian overreach.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating that stimulus measures are not effectively boosting domestic consumption. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices also declined, deepening deflation worries. A price war in the automotive industry is contributing to the downward pressure on prices, prompting policymakers to urge companies to halt the aggressive discounting. As temporary trade truces appear shaky, markets are closely monitoring whether Beijing will implement further monetary easing policies to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The proclamation restricts nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Iran, Libya, and Somalia from entering the U.S., while imposing partial restrictions on others. Unlike the initial 2017 ban, this new measure includes non-Muslim majority countries like Haiti, but it still faces criticism for its potential to disproportionately affect African nations and for being rooted in racism. The ban does not revoke previously issued visas, but new applications will be rejected unless they meet specific exemption criteria.</p>
