          <p>Lawmakers in California and Texas are engaged in a political battle over congressional redistricting, with Missouri joining the fray, and this dispute could significantly impact the balance of power in Washington DC. Texas Republicans initiated the conflict by redrawing districts to favor their party, prompting California Democrats to respond in kind. Missouri then convened a special session to redraw maps, aiming to secure an additional Republican seat, and President Trump has urged Republican-controlled states to redraw districts to maintain control of Congress. The legal battles and political maneuvering highlight the partisan intentions behind redistricting efforts. This redistricting could have significant implications for the 2026 midterms.

          <p>The CDC has issued a warning for travelers to China due to an outbreak of chikungunya in Guangdong Province, a mosquito-borne virus that causes fever and joint pain. The CDC recommends travelers practice enhanced precautions, including using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves and pants, and the CDC also suggests travelers get vaccinated, though pregnant women are urged to reconsider travel to the affected areas, as newborns can face severe illness if infected. Chinese officials have responded aggressively to the outbreak, and joint pain caused by the virus can be severe and prolonged. Severe symptoms and death are rare and usually occur in babies, the elderly and people with underlying conditions. The optimism score is not directly related to the content of the article.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's effort to expand fast-track deportations throughout the U.S., citing due process concerns, and the ruling is a setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts. The judge paused a January directive that had expanded the expedited removal policy to anywhere in the country and to those who arrived in the past two years, which allowed immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants without allowing them to see an immigration judge. The judge said the pro-immigrant advocates had made a "strong showing" that the effort "violates the due process rights of those it affects."

          <p>The FBI discovered bones during a search operation in Washington state related to the manhunt for Travis Decker, who is accused of killing his three daughters, and the search involved nearly 100 personnel members, including specialty search teams. The bones were collected around the Rock Island Campground and are being analyzed to determine if they are human or animal, and the FBI also found "several items" that are being analyzed to determine whether they are connected to the case. Decker is wanted for three counts of murder in the first degree and three counts of kidnapping, and the girls' bodies were found in his truck near the Rock Island Campground on June 2.

Figures show that of the 439 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land between January 2023 and last month, 385 were caused by present-day army manoeuvres themselves. The MoD said it has a robust wildfire policy which monitors risk levels and limits live ammunition use when necessary, but locals near the sites of recent fires feel the MoD needs to do more to prevent them.

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are now requiring a prescription or are not offering COVID-19 vaccines in some states as the companies attempt to follow state guidelines that require approvals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA has approved vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax for all seniors, but only for younger adults and children with health conditions. CVS said it cannot vaccinate those even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico due to state laws and regulations. The American Academy of Pediatrics released vaccine recommendations that, for the first time in 30 years, differ from U.S. government advice.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing sweeping import taxes on almost every country on earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York, but the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose erratic trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralyzed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

          <p>The White House is defending Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr after a chaotic week at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that led to calls for his removal, and Stephen Miller called Kennedy "a crown jewel of this administration".

          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been blocked from attending the UN General Assembly session in New York next month after he and 80 other Palestinian officials had their visas revoked, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed them for undermining peace efforts and for seeking "the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state". The decision is unusual as the US is expected to facilitate travel for officials of all countries wishing to visit the UN headquarters, and the ban comes as France leads international efforts to recognise a state of Palestine at the session.
