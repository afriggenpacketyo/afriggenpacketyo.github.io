          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump convened to strategize on the GOP's budget reconciliation efforts, aiming to reshape federal spending in line with Trump's domestic agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted "great unity" among Republican leaders on the budget bill, focusing on trade, tax, and deregulation. Despite some market volatility attributed to tariff policies, Johnson expressed optimism about the economy's future and the GOP's prospects in upcoming elections. However, recent polling indicates declining public approval of the President's performance, creating some headwinds for the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is facing questions regarding the accuracy of her credentials, specifically concerning her medical degree and board certifications. Records indicate she obtained her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine, not the University of Arkansas School of Medicine as she has sometimes implied. Her claims of being double board-certified have also been challenged, with only family medicine certification verifiable. Medical ethicists emphasize the importance of transparency and credibility for the Surgeon General role, particularly in public health communication.</p>

          <p>New requirements imposed on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine by the Trump administration are causing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines. The FDA is reportedly asking Novavax to conduct a new clinical trial post-approval, raising concerns about delays for yearly strain updates. This move follows the ousting of the agency's vaccine chief and scrutiny from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about vaccines.

Both countries affirmed the continued benefit of the 1944 treaty governing water distribution and agreed it does not require renegotiation.

          <p>Canadians went to the polls to elect their next leader, with the election largely influenced by President Donald Trump's actions. Recent polling suggests a slight advantage for the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, over the Conservative Party. Trump's imposition of tariffs and threats to annex Canada have shifted the focus of the election, with voters viewing Carney as the best defense against Trump's policies. The election outcome will determine who will navigate the complex relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Premiership Rugby is considering a revamp that could be implemented as early as next season, involving a qualification model based on financial sustainability, fanbase, and stadium criteria, not just on-field performance. This change would require approval from the RFU Council and could pave the way for teams like Worcester Warriors to return to the top flight. Other competitions have found financial success with franchise teams free from relegation. Despite financial pressures, Sweeney expressed optimism about the Premiership's momentum, citing sponsorship deals and growing interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's actions, including provoking a trade war and scrapping treaties, have significantly disrupted the global economic order. The changes have been deep, and reversing them may be challenging even after Trump's term ends. The dismantling of governmental infrastructure and the erosion of international cooperation make it difficult to restore the previous economic landscape. The long-term consequences of these actions could persist beyond the current administration.</p>

While the story follows familiar themes, the tangible nature of the puppet compensates for the film's less accomplished moments.
