          <p>Chaos erupted on a XiamenAir flight in China when several passengers left their seats on the taxiing aircraft to rush the business-class cabin. The fans were attempting to get close to Chinese actor Tian Xuning, who was a passenger on the flight from Changsha to Fuzhou. Their actions created a hazardous situation by disrupting the plane's movement and ignoring crew instructions, highlighting a growing issue with extreme fan behavior. The incident caused delays and raised concerns about passenger safety and aviation security protocols when celebrities are on board.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after an industrial tunnel they were working in partially collapsed in Los Angeles. The workers, located about 400 feet underground and six miles from the entrance, had to climb over a large pile of loose soil to reach a tunnel boring machine for extraction. Authorities reported no major injuries among the rescued individuals, and officials praised the workers' composure and the swift action of first responders. The cause of the collapse is under investigation, and work on the $700 million wastewater project is paused until the site is deemed safe.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of cautious optimism, fueled by both sporting success and political progress. The men's national football team is leading its qualification group for a potential first World Cup appearance since 1974, which could bring significant investment and global attention. This comes alongside a recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, which, if it holds, could end decades of conflict in the country's eastern region. Analysts believe that stability is crucial for the development of football and society, providing young people with alternatives to violence and fostering national unity.</p>

          <p>Consumers in the U.S. are reporting noticeable price increases on everyday goods like clothing and footwear, which they attribute to ongoing trade disputes and tariffs. A recent study confirmed that prices for apparel and footwear have risen in the last six months, and major retailers like Macy's have indicated they must pass some increased costs from tariffs onto customers. The Trump administration's trade negotiations with multiple countries, including a new deal with Vietnam, continue to create uncertainty for retailers and shoppers alike. While some consumers have not yet felt a major impact, many are becoming more budget-conscious.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse stated that Democrats and climate advocates must adopt a more aggressive stance against the fossil fuel industry, which he accused of running a 'malevolent propaganda operation.' He argued that the industry avoids accountability for the massive environmental and health damages it causes. Whitehouse, who recently delivered his 300th climate speech in the Senate, criticized his own party for not forcefully calling out the industry's influence and 'dark money' in politics. He believes that engaging more aggressively on the issue would resonate with voters who overwhelmingly support stronger climate action.</p>

          <p>Following a recent conflict between Israel and Iran, analysts predict China will likely strengthen its support for Tehran to secure its strategic interests in the region. This move requires a delicate balance, as Beijing must avoid damaging its relationships with Arab nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The heightened tensions, which included a brief U.S. military involvement and Israeli threats against Iran's leadership, have renewed global concerns over political stability in the Middle East. China's geopolitical maneuvering will be closely watched as it navigates the complex dynamics to protect its influence and investments.</p>

          <p>The UK's postal regulator, Ofcom, has approved changes allowing Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and reduce delivery frequency during the week. Under the new plan, second-class mail will be delivered on alternating weekdays to help the service cut costs amid declining letter volumes. While Royal Mail welcomed the reform as necessary for financial sustainability, the move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and businesses.

          <h2>China's Weight-Loss Drug Market Poised for Major Growth, Valued at $150 Billion</h2>

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with analysts estimating its potential value at US$150 billion as dozens of domestic producers enter the field. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by rising obesity rates and the approval of new, more effective medications. Innovent Biologics was the first Chinese company to receive approval to market a modern weight-loss drug in the country. The burgeoning market reflects a significant public health issue and presents a major commercial opportunity for China's pharmaceutical industry, which is now competing to develop and sell these treatments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is often cited as a 'renters' utopia' due to its successful housing policies, which are centered around a large and stable social housing sector. This sector accounts for 43% of the city's housing units and serves not only low-income residents but also middle-class households, keeping rent levels significantly lower than in the private market. The system, originating in the 1920s and funded partly by a levy on employee salaries, has largely resisted the privatization seen in other European cities. While access can be complex, Vienna's long-term commitment to non-market housing demonstrates that policy can make housing more affordable.</p>

          <p>A research team at the Beijing Institute of Technology has created the world's lightest insect brain controller, successfully turning a bee into a remotely guided 'cyborg.' The 74-milligram device is strapped to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain, creating illusions that command its flight. In tests, the bee obeyed commands to turn, advance, and retreat with 90% accuracy. This technological breakthrough could have future applications in areas such as search and rescue, surveillance, or precision pollination, pushing the boundaries of bio-integrated robotics.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement a 50% tariff on all copper imports, effective August 1, citing a national security assessment. The White House stated that copper is a critical material for defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential industries, and the move aims to bring production back to the United States. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, and experts predict the tariff will lead to domestic shortages and price increases in the short term. This policy aligns with similar duties recently placed on steel and aluminum imports. (not investment advice)</p>

The exchange went viral in Singapore, with many questioning his suitability for the key diplomatic post.

Albanese has been a vocal critic of Israel's military conduct, describing it as 'genocide,' and has supported ICC arrest warrants for Israeli officials.

According to police, the car's engine automatically shut off after an hour, disabling the air conditioning. The one-year-old was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at a hospital, while the older sibling survived and is now in protective custody.

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness found that some of the world's poorest nations, including Somalia and Haiti, are paying millions to lobbying firms with ties to Donald Trump. These countries, which were high recipients of US foreign aid, have signed contracts worth at least $17 million since the last election, seemingly to offset aid cuts and secure favorable deals. The report suggests a desperate situation where low-income countries are bartering natural resources for humanitarian or military support. This dynamic raises concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable nations and the shift from traditional aid to transactional dealmaking.</p>

The move is a response to Germany's own tightened migration policies, but locals say it disrupts daily life, which heavily relies on open borders for work, school, and commerce. The situation is further complicated by the appearance of self-proclaimed 'citizen patrols' monitoring the border. The checks represent another strain on the Schengen Agreement's principle of free travel, with local officials worried about the long-term impact on German-Polish relations.</p>
