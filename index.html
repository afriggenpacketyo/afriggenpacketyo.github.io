          <h2>Japan Grapples with Declining Birth Rate and Population</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:44:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population declining for 15 consecutive years and projected to halve by the end of the century, impacting the economy, healthcare, and national defense. The government is struggling to stimulate birth rates amidst a punishing work culture, stagnant economy, and changing social norms. Efforts to address this include government-sponsored dating apps and promoting rural living, but a sweeping mindset change is needed to reverse the trend. The situation in Japan serves as a warning for other countries, including the United States, facing similar demographic challenges.</p>

          <h2>NIH Budget Cuts Threaten U.S. Scientific Leadership</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 19:44:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the Trump administration are raising concerns about a potential "brain drain" as scientists consider leaving the U.S. for better opportunities abroad. The cuts could slow down or halt critical research on diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, impacting the health of Americans for generations. China, along with other countries, is actively recruiting scientists, potentially jeopardizing the U.S.'s long-held status as the leader in biomedical research. Loss of this leadership could have significant economic consequences, as highlighted by the Human Genome Project's substantial return on investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. birth rate continues to decline, mirroring trends seen in countries like Japan, raising concerns about future economic stability and the ability to support an aging population. Factors contributing to this decline include fewer teenage pregnancies due to increased contraception use and a societal shift in how people value family, work, and personal fulfillment. Experts suggest that economic confidence, affordable childcare, and supportive policies are crucial to encouraging would-be parents. Cash incentives are unlikely to have a significant impact, as global evidence suggests that fertility cannot be bought.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newly surfaced evidence, including a video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol, was not shared with FBI field agents or top intelligence officials after 9/11, raising questions about potential missed connections and the full extent of support for the hijackers. The video, along with an airplane sketch and math formula, were seized from the Saudi national's apartment shortly after the attacks. Experts believe the video shows pre-operational surveillance of the Capitol, and the sketch could be used to calculate the rate of descent to hit a target. The Saudi government denies any involvement in the attacks, but the new evidence has fueled a lawsuit by 9/11 families.</p>

          <p>Cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are raising concerns about the future of medical research and the health of Americans. The downsizing has led to the firing of employees and cancellation of research grants, potentially slowing down progress on treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. The NIH is a major contributor to biomedical breakthroughs, and these cuts could lead to a loss of scientific talent and a decline in the U.S.'s leadership in medical research. A new director has been appointed to the NIH, and he is working to undo some of the recent disruptions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a rapid remaking of the nation through executive actions, pushing the boundaries of presidential power and sparking constitutional challenges.

Authorities believe the theft was not targeted at Noem specifically, but rather motivated by the luxury bag itself.

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are declining as he nears 100 days in office, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his handling of the presidency. Polls show his approval rating hovering between 39% and 45%, the lowest for any newly elected president at this point in their term in over seven decades. The latest approval ratings represent a shift from earlier in the year when Trump saw an uptick in his favorability.</p>
