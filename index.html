          <h2>Bipartisan Congressional Group Pushes for Broader Release of Jeffrey Epstein-Related Documents</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 15:26:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan coalition in Congress is advocating for the release of a wider range of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, beyond what the Trump administration has requested. This effort, led by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, seeks flight logs, financial records, and internal Justice Department communications, putting it at odds with the White House's more limited approach. The push creates a political challenge for Republican leadership, who are trying to manage base demands for full transparency while navigating the administration's position. Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking testimony from Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, to further investigate the sex trafficking network.</p>

          <p>Two high school track and field athletes in Oregon have filed a lawsuit against the state's school athletics association, alleging their First Amendment rights were violated. The lawsuit stems from an incident where the girls refused to stand on a medal podium with a transgender competitor, after which they claim they were excluded from official photos and had their medals withheld. Represented by the America First Policy Institute, the athletes are challenging the Oregon School Athletics Association's policies that permit biologically male athletes to compete in girls' sports. This is the second such lawsuit filed in the state within a month, reflecting a growing national debate over the issue.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior ice hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, in her ruling, stated that she did not find the complainant's evidence to be "credible or reliable," citing inconsistencies in her testimony and an "uncertain memory" of the events. The case centered on the issue of consent, with the defense arguing the woman was a willing participant who later experienced regret. The high-profile trial has drawn significant public attention in Canada, highlighting complex issues surrounding consent and credibility in legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The new romantic comedy-thriller "Oh, Hi!" stars Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman as a couple whose relationship unravels during a weekend getaway. The film critiques the modern "softboy" archetype through Lerman's character, Isaac, who avoids commitment while feigning deep emotional connection, leading to a tense, hostage-like situation orchestrated by his frustrated girlfriend, Iris. This article reviews the movie, praising the performances of Gordon and co-star Geraldine Viswanathan but noting that the script struggles to define Iris's character consistently. The film serves as a commentary on gender tropes and the difficulties of communication in contemporary relationships, making it a relevant, if sometimes uneven, watch.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years.

His tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, and by his successful push for new legislative maps that are more favorable to Democrats. The announcement is expected to trigger a competitive primary for both parties ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

Nadella framed the cuts as part of a necessary, dynamic process for success in the tech sector.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on a lower court ruling that would have significantly weakened the Voting Rights Act.

This case originated from a lawsuit by two tribal nations in North Dakota challenging a redistricting plan. The Supreme Court's pause allows the current, more favorable voting map to remain for now, but the larger question of who can bring such lawsuits could be taken up for a full review, potentially further eroding the landmark civil rights law.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the Trump administration's approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from constraining maximalist ambitions to reinforcing them. Initially, the Biden administration pressured Israel to oppose the resettlement of Gaza, but President Trump's subsequent proposal to turn Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East" was interpreted by Israel's far-right as a green light for displacement. The author argues this has prolonged the conflict by giving Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition a reason to delay a resolution. To achieve a lasting ceasefire, the article suggests, the Trump administration must retract this proposal and make it clear that a two-state framework remains the only viable path forward.</p>

For months, Trump has criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, a stance Powell has defended by citing the need to monitor inflation risks from tariffs.

Routh, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple federal and state charges, had claimed his relationship with his attorneys was "irreconcilably broken." The trial is scheduled to begin in September, one year after a Secret Service agent allegedly thwarted the attempt.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick asserted that CEOs of major U.S. auto companies are "cool with" a new trade agreement with Japan, despite public criticism from their industry group. The deal sets a 15% tariff on cars imported from Japan, which is lower than the 25% tariff applied to vehicles U.S. companies build in Canada and Mexico for import. The American Automotive Policy Council, representing GM, Ford, and Stellantis, called it a "bad deal," but Lutnick dismissed this as PR maneuvering. He argued that U.S. automakers can avoid the tariffs entirely by moving their manufacturing operations back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, known worldwide as professional wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71. Hogan was a pivotal figure in transforming wrestling into a global entertainment phenomenon in the 1980s, known for his "Hulkamania" persona. His career included multiple WWE championships, a famous villainous turn in WCW, and crossover success in movies and television. Later in life, he faced controversies, including a high-profile lawsuit against Gawker and being temporarily fired from WWE for racist remarks, for which he later apologized. He recently endorsed Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have not yet led to the predicted runaway inflation, though economists warn the effects are likely delayed, not averted. Companies have so far absorbed costs and used existing inventory to avoid sharp price hikes, but this is not sustainable long-term. The staggered rollout of tariffs, with many delayed until August, has also postponed the full impact. Economists suggest that price increases on tariff-sensitive goods like electronics, apparel, and appliances are likely to become more noticeable by the end of the year as businesses can no longer shield consumers from the increased import costs.

These roles range from specialized AI engineers to more general positions in fields like marketing and finance that now require AI competency.

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better place to park $25,000 in the current economic climate. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% APY would earn approximately $18 more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30% APY. The primary advantage of the CD is its fixed rate, which guarantees the return and protects against potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, the article advises that the decision should depend on individual financial needs, recommending the more liquid high-yield savings account for those without a robust emergency fund.

          <p>In a highly unusual move that challenges the central bank's traditional independence, President Donald Trump made an official visit to the Federal Reserve. The visit is seen as an escalation of his public campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not cutting interest rates. This direct engagement comes after Trump floated the idea of firing Powell over cost overruns on a Fed building renovation. While American presidents have criticized the Fed in the past, a sitting president visiting the institution to apply direct pressure is a remarkable symbolic break from precedent.</p>
