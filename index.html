          <p>Disney plans to vacate the Fox Studio Lot in Century City by the end of the year, ending its lease agreement.  This move comes after Disney acquired most of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets in 2019, but not the studio lot itself.  Disney's departure puts pressure on Fox Corp. to find new tenants for the property. Disney aims to consolidate its television operations in Burbank, creating a centralized creative hub.</p>
