          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release after determining her due process and First Amendment rights were likely violated. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas, which the Trump administration cited as the primary reason for revoking her student visa. Leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release, emphasizing that her detention was an attempt to silence dissent, and Tufts University expressed eagerness to welcome her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump announced on Truth Social that "great progress" had been made during trade negotiations with China in Geneva. According to Trump, the agreement represents "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner," though specifics were not provided. The talks follow the Trump administration's imposition of a 145% tariff on Chinese goods after China reduced reciprocal tariffs on other countries, leading to a trade battle between the two nations. Trump stated that the goal is to open China to American business for the benefit of both countries.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks' China operations reported flat same-store sales but saw a 4% increase in transactions, offsetting a decline in average tab. The company has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets in China, adding 665 stores in the past year. This strategy reflects an effort to defend market share as competition persists, though the long-term sustainability beyond wealthier cities remains to be seen.</p>

While atmospheric rivers typically impact the Western U.S., this event is caused by a cutoff low diverting a jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The precipitation could alleviate recent drought conditions in some areas, but residents are advised to take precautions against potential flooding.</p>

          <p>Autopsy performers have shared some of the strangest anomalies they've encountered, ranging from anatomical variations to unexpected medical conditions. These include cases of situs inversus (organs in mirrored positions), uterine didelphys (a split vagina leading to two cervixes), and individuals with incredibly thick skulls and smaller-than-expected brains. One particularly striking case involved a man stabbed through the heart who also had a golf ball-sized tumor on his brainstem, which he was unaware of. Another involved a child with hydrocephalus who was found to have no brain tissue inside his skull.</p>

          <p>Livestock farmer David Thornley plans legal action against East Midlands Airport, claiming a leaking pipe polluted a brook, leading to the loss of pedigree lambs. He claims that 25 of his ewes lost their valuable pedigree lambs after drinking from Diseworth Brook in 2022, with the airport pleading guilty to exceeding environmental permit limits by releasing water containing chemicals. Environmental studies show de-icing chemicals can affect water quality, though the airport denies any direct link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of new sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Ukraine and threatened Russia with "new and massive" sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Putin refused to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. Putin dismissed the demand and proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, seeking to eliminate the root causes of the conflict.</p>
