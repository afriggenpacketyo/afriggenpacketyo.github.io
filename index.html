          <p>The Trump administration has issued letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly, demanding they take significant steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. President Trump threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies fail to comply. This move follows a recent executive order reviving the "most favored nation" policy, which aims to align U.S. drug costs with the lower prices paid in other developed countries. The administration rejected previous industry proposals, insisting on immediate relief for American families.</p>

          <p>Arm Holdings experienced a significant stock drop of over 13% after providing a weaker-than-expected profit forecast for the upcoming quarter. The company's guidance for adjusted earnings fell short of Wall Street projections, raising investor concerns. Compounding the issue, CEO Rene Haas suggested that Arm is exploring the possibility of designing its own processors, a strategic shift from its established business model of licensing chip architecture. This potential transition introduces uncertainty and is seen by analysts as a major leap that could substantially alter the company's cost structure and business focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite reporting strong quarterly earnings that beat estimates and raising its full-year guidance, Bristol Myers Squibb's shares fell by 4%. Investor confidence appears to be shaken by two primary concerns: the uncertain growth trajectory of its new schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, and the potential impact of the Trump administration's pharmaceutical policies, including tariffs. The upcoming late-stage trial data for Cobenfy is seen as a critical event for the company's future. Analysts are lowering the stock's price target, reflecting a cautious wait-and-see approach until there is more clarity on these key issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of Apple's third-quarter results, investors on prediction platforms are betting on the likelihood of certain words being mentioned during the earnings call. There is a high probability placed on terms like "China" and "Tariff," reflecting concerns about the company's manufacturing and market pressures under the Trump administration's trade policies. Apple has been expanding production to India and Vietnam to mitigate these risks. Analysts anticipate a challenging quarter for iPhone sales due to macroeconomic headwinds and increased competition, making the company's commentary on its global strategy and supply chain adjustments highly anticipated by Wall Street.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise in a dispute involving Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, granting the company a temporary exemption from import taxes. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tariff-free for six months in early 2026 as it establishes its new local factory. However, the government also moved to accelerate tariff hikes in the long run, with levies on EV kits rising to 35% by January 2027. The decision balances BYD's request for relief with pressure from domestic automakers who warned that a broader exemption could threaten local jobs and investment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff are scheduled to visit Gaza to inspect aid distribution sites and develop a plan to address the severe food crisis. The visit follows a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss methods for delivering essential aid to the region. According to the White House, the envoys will meet with local Gazans to understand the dire situation firsthand. They will then brief President Trump to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution, an effort described by the administration as a humanitarian mission to save lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest ever found in Australia. The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. Researchers suggest its large body mass likely evolved over millions of years to help it survive in the colder, high-altitude canopy environment. The insect's discovery was aided by its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum's collection to facilitate further scientific research on this unique creature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) into an annuity is a wise financial move for pre-retirees in the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility. While annuities can provide a guaranteed, predictable income stream, which is appealing for risk-averse individuals, they also come with potential downsides like high fees and limited liquidity. The decision depends heavily on individual circumstances, including one's proximity to retirement, risk tolerance, and the need for a stable income versus investment growth potential. A partial rollover is presented as a possible compromise for balancing security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Following feedback from government partners, officials found a way to continue providing the data until at least September 2026.

However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rationally focused and had patient safety as a foremost concern.

The case, brought by a group of states and small businesses, represents a major legal challenge to a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy.

          <p>NASA and SpaceX scrubbed the planned launch of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station just moments before liftoff due to unfavorable weather conditions over the Kennedy Space Center. The mission was set to carry a four-person crew, including three astronauts who were reassigned to this flight after issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule altered previous schedules. The launch was timed for a precise window to align with the space station's orbit for rendezvous. The next launch attempt is scheduled for the following day, though forecasters predict a continued risk of poor weather, including high winds and clouds.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Chaplain Joon Park of Tampa General Hospital, exploring his work with dying patients and their families. Park, who came to his faith after an atheist upbringing in an abusive home, believes that death is a profound spiritual experience where people grapple with the meaning of their lives. He notes that in moments of crisis, people often turn to spirituality, sometimes with anger towards God and sometimes with deep faith. Park finds that love, whether from family or caregivers, is a manifestation of the divine, making the hospital a sacred space where he witnesses both extreme suffering and profound connection.</p>

          <p>Legislation aimed at banning members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks has advanced out of a Senate committee with an 8-7 vote. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats in supporting the measure, which he introduced, while other Republicans voted against it. The bill would require lawmakers to divest their individual stock holdings and provide annual certifications of compliance. The move has created a notable political dynamic, with former President Trump initially expressing conceptual support before criticizing Hawley on social media, alleging the bill was a Democratic ploy against him.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck near Rialto in San Bernardino County, with shaking felt across a wide area of Southern California, including Los Angeles and Orange counties. The temblor occurred Thursday morning and was followed by several smaller aftershocks, part of what seismologists describe as a small swarm in the Fontana Trend, an area known for frequent minor seismic activity. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the shaking was mostly light to weak and not strong enough to cause significant damage. There were no immediate reports of injuries or major structural issues resulting from the event.</p>

The increase in arrivals has coincided with a rise in the average number of people per boat. In response, the government states it is working with French authorities to dismantle smuggling networks, while campaigners continue to advocate for more safe and legal routes to deter the dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have agreed to extend their trade negotiations for another 90 days, postponing the implementation of punitive new tariffs on Mexican goods. The decision was announced after a phone call between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. During this period, existing tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and a 50% tariff on steel and copper, will remain in place. The extension provides both nations more time to construct a long-term trade agreement, with Trump calling the conversation "very successful" and Sheinbaum noting the goal is to build a deal in line with continued dialogue.</p>

Investors will also be focused on the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and whether the company's massive investments in AI are paying off.
