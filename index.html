          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has temporarily banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its markets over allegations of market manipulation. The regulator has also frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, accusing the firm of using manipulative strategies to influence the Nifty 50 index for profit. While Jane Street disputes the findings, SEBI claims the firm's actions demonstrated it was not a "good faith actor," especially after ignoring a prior advisory. This move comes as India's derivatives markets attract more global firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after a significant election victory, the UK's Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, faces considerable challenges. The government has struggled to deliver on economic promises, leading to a drop in Starmer's approval ratings amid high inflation and borrowing costs. While some success has been achieved with international trade deals, domestic issues and a series of policy U-turns have created a difficult political environment. The rising popularity of the rival Reform UK party adds further pressure on the administration.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi is warning that the Iranian government is using its recent conflict with Israel as a pretext to intensify repression against its own citizens. In a message from Tehran, she stated that a surge in executions and arrests aims to "spread fear and terror" and deflect from domestic policy failures. Mohammadi, who is currently defying an order to return to prison, also expressed grave concern for the conditions of political prisoners, particularly after an Israeli strike on Evin Prison, where many are held.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled to visit several rural counties in South Carolina, a key early presidential primary state, sparking speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. His advisors deny that a presidential run is the motive, stating the trip is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting issues in rural communities. The tour will take Newsom through some of the state's most conservative and economically challenged areas. This visit is part of a broader pattern of outreach by Newsom to voters in southern states.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully grown a beating heart structure containing human cells within a pig embryo, a first in the field of chimera research. The structure, developed at the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, continued to beat for 21 days without assistance. Researchers reprogrammed human stem cells to improve their survival in the pig embryos before implantation. This breakthrough follows the team's previous success in cultivating human kidneys in pigs and represents a significant step forward in organ generation research.</p>

          <p>Over 175 congressional Democrats are supporting an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. They filed an amicus brief arguing that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or dismantle a federal agency created by Congress. The lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, contend that the administration's actions, including significant staff reductions and pausing grant programs, illegally undermine public education. The move is part of a larger political and legal battle over the future of the department.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Fourth of July weekend, Los Angeles County health officials have issued warnings for eight local beaches due to high levels of bacteria. Residents are advised to avoid swimming, surfing, and other water activities at these locations, which include popular spots in Santa Monica, Malibu, and Catalina Island. The increased bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff. Public health officials warn that contact with the contaminated water can cause illness and skin infections, with children and the elderly being at higher risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the national park system to implement higher entrance fees for foreign tourists while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The order instructs the Interior Department to develop a strategy for the fee hike, which the administration estimates could generate over $90 million annually for park improvements. The directive, framed as an "America first" policy, also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems like lotteries or permits.</p>

The person, who was unarmed, traversed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

It is not yet confirmed if the incident was a defection attempt, which has become rarer across the dangerous DMZ in recent years.</p>

          <p>Staffing cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are raising safety concerns at popular summer destinations like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore. Due to a federal hiring freeze and budget reductions, some beaches are now without lifeguards, prompting fears of potential drownings. According to an advocacy group, the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff under the Trump administration, and seasonal hiring has fallen short of targets. This shortage of personnel is creating tangible risks for the millions of visitors to national parks.</p>
