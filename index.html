            <p>Tennessee lawmakers, known for their strict abortion bans, are now pushing legislation to deny public education to undocumented children. The bill, which allows schools to check students' immigration status, faces legal challenges due to its unconstitutionality. Proponents argue it's a matter of fiscal responsibility, citing limited state funds for education. Critics contend that Tennessee's regressive tax policies contribute to the issue and that the bill reflects a broader trend of undermining education and critical thinking. The bill has faced strong opposition, highlighting divisions within the state government.</p>

This unwavering support highlights the challenge right-wing media faces in balancing loyalty to Trump with objective reporting on economic realities.

            <p>The article draws parallels between Trump's tariff policies and Liz Truss's economic missteps in the UK, warning of a potential 'moron premium' affecting US bond yields and borrowing costs. It argues that Trump's actions, like Truss's, have created instability and distrust in the markets, potentially weakening America's long-term economic standing. The author suggests that Trump's pursuit of economic decoupling from China and disregard for geopolitical alliances could undermine the dollar's dominance and lead to negative consequences for the US economy.

Despite Makled's concerns about attorney-client privilege, agents threatened to confiscate his device unless he provided his contact list. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) claimed it was a routine inspection, but Makled believes he was targeted for representing a pro-Palestinian student protester. The incident raises concerns about potential overreach and the erosion of Fourth Amendment protections at the border.</p>

            <p>Mathematician Chen Min has left Purdue University’s maths department to join the Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo as a full-time faculty member, the latest Chinese academic to return home from the US. Chen joins her husband, Shen Jie, at EIT after he accepted an offer to become the new dean of its School of Mathematical Science in 2023. The couple met back in 1978 at Peking University’s Department of Mathematics, after universities began enrolling students again following the chaos and turmoil of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, when admissions had been suspended for more than a decade.</p>

            <p>The article argues that Congress should reclaim its constitutional power to levy tariffs in response to President Trump's recent imposition of tariffs. It contends that Trump's actions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are a dubious justification for tariffs and that his erratic policies create instability in the global economy. The article emphasizes the need for Congress to assert its authority to ensure stability and prevent potential corruption.

            <p>Third Point and D.E. Shaw have entered into support agreements with CoStar Group, leading to board refreshment and corporate governance enhancements. The agreement includes the addition of new directors and the creation of a capital allocation committee. The core business of CoStar is highly profitable but its profits are being used to fund an unprofitable non-core business. The capital allocation committee will likely be tasked with finding ways to fund the Homes.com business without using the cash flow from the core business. The goal is to value the core CoStar business with international growth prospects on a multiple of its consistent $1.3 billion EBITDA. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The April sell-off in financial markets has raised concerns about long-term damage to the US financial standing. The S&P 500 has dropped significantly since President Trump's tariff announcement, accompanied by slides in the dollar and Treasuries. Some analysts suggest a rotation out of US assets, with the dollar hitting its lowest level in three years. Concerns about the structural attractiveness of the dollar as the global reserve currency are growing. A decline in foreign holdings of US Treasuries would put upward pressure on interest rates and downward pressure on the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

While global financial markets experienced significant losses, Trump spent his time golfing, dining with donors, and making insouciant declarations. This juxtaposition has drawn comparisons to historical figures who were detached from the suffering of their people. Critics argue that Trump's behavior demonstrates a lack of concern for the anxieties of ordinary citizens and a disconnect from reality.</p>

Matthew Okula hopes to educate expecting mothers about the complication and encourage them to discuss it with their healthcare providers. His wife, Hailey Marie Okula, a nursing influencer, died after giving birth to their son. Amniotic fluid embolism is difficult to prevent because there aren't any preceding risk factors, making it impossible to prevent, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs are causing a debate over the balance between preserving American jobs and providing affordable goods to consumers. While tariffs could protect jobs in specific industries by discouraging imports, US consumers would likely pay higher prices. Economists note that import competition from China has led to job losses in certain regions, but tariffs could also negatively impact consumers. The article highlights the complex trade-offs involved in trade policy and the need to consider both the benefits and costs of tariffs.</p>
