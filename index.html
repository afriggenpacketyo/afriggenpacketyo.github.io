          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old in Dacula, Georgia, went to Burger King after his graduation and helped his overwhelmed coworkers, despite not being on the clock. A customer, Maria Mendoza, was impressed by his work ethic and posted a video online, starting a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign raised over $200,000, which Baker plans to use for trade school to become a master auto mechanic and open his own shop. The Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker and Mendoza's daughter with $10,000 each, recognizing their achievements and integrity, highlighting the positive impact of hard work and community recognition. </p>

Biles responded by accusing Gaines of being a "sore loser" and bullying the trans community, suggesting the creation of a separate transgender category in sports.

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement by mid-June, despite remaining differences on key issues. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, stated that progress was made during talks with U.S. officials in Washington, but no final decisions have been reached. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently include a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods. Japan has proposed joint efforts in areas such as supply chain resilience, shipbuilding cooperation, increased imports of U.S. farm products, and streamlined safety regulations for foreign-made cars.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling 14 flights a day through July due to tariffs that are hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring additional tariff-related costs. These aircraft were intended for Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May, and Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April. Delta Air Lines has also taken steps to avoid paying tariffs on new aircraft by having them delivered to Japan first.</p>

The conflict, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill, led to a 14% drop in Tesla shares and a $34 billion decrease in Musk's net worth. The breakdown of their relationship could impact Tesla's regulatory environment and government support. Tesla was already underperforming due to increased competition and consumer backlash against Trump's political activities, and the company has been facing vandalism and protests over Musk's actions.

          <h2>Government Struggles to Reduce Foreign Aid Spending on Asylum Hotels</h2>

          <p>The government is finding it difficult to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. New figures show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. The money is primarily used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. Critics argue that diverting foreign aid to cover domestic costs is unsustainable and comes at the expense of vital development and humanitarian programs.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief and convicted killer and rapist, was captured after a 13-day manhunt in the mountains of northern Arkansas. Hardin, nicknamed the “Devil in the Ozarks,” escaped from the Calico Rock prison after impersonating a corrections officer. The search involved bloodhounds, officers on horseback, drones, and an elite U.S. border patrol team. Hardin was serving sentences for the murder of James Appleton and the sexual assault of a teacher.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers who transported platforms for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, loaded onto the trucks, and remotely opened for the attack. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's secret services used only their own weapons in the operation. Ukraine claimed to have damaged over 40 Russian bombers in the attacks, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet.</p>
