            <p>Westchester County Police responded to a call about a llama on the loose, only to discover it was an alpaca that had escaped from a nearby trailer. Officers Mirko and Rodriguez successfully rounded up the alpaca near a Land Rover dealership, jokingly suggesting the animal was looking for a new ride. The alpaca was safely returned to its owner, leading police to speculate that a child's birthday party was able to proceed as planned. Alpacas, native to the Andes Mountains, are commonly used in petting zoos and children's events.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against accommodating the United States in trade discussions concerning President Trump's tariffs. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson stated that countries should uphold international economic and trade rules, emphasizing that appeasement and compromise will not earn respect. This warning follows reports that the US plans to pressure countries into restricting trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from US import taxes.

            <p>Prison officers are demanding that staff be given electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding the UK's most dangerous jails.

The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is calling for the tactical use of tasers by specially trained staff.

            <p>This article reviews the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us," focusing on the death of protagonist Joel and the subsequent shift in storytelling. While praising the show's ability to expand beyond the game's limits in the first season, the review critiques the second season's forced brutality and lack of nuance. The author argues that the show has become a punishing watch, leaning too heavily into misery and failing to explore the characters' emotional journeys with the same elegance as the first season.</p>
