        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential second Trump administration is expected to continue viewing China as a primary military competitor, shaping U.S. defense priorities around this "pacing threat." This strategic focus involves assessing how to maintain a military advantage over the People's Liberation Army, which has been undergoing rapid modernization. The approach would likely influence everything from weapons development and deployment to strategic alliances in the Indo-Pacific region. This article explores the potential defense policies and priorities aimed at ensuring American military superiority in the face of China's growing strength.</p>

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia have announced a new initiative to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals, a move aimed at reducing reliance on China's market dominance. The 'Quad' group's joint statement emphasized the risks of depending on a single country, citing potential economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The initiative was announced following a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C. This collaboration seeks to diversify supply chains for minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies, reinforcing strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The Brooklyn-based judge stated the Department of Homeland Security lacks the authority to revoke the designation before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The administration had planned to end the protections in September, which would have removed work permits and exposed migrants to deportation. The court's decision emphasized that migrants had relied on the existing deadline to enroll in schools, secure jobs, and receive medical treatment.</p>

          <p>North Korean state media has released footage showing leader Kim Jong Un emotionally mourning over the caskets of troops who were reportedly killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The images, broadcast as part of a cultural performance, depicted Kim placing a flag on a coffin, seemingly confirming his country's military support for Moscow's war effort. This display occurred during an event marking the anniversary of a strategic partnership treaty between North Korea and Russia. The broadcast also included photos of North Korean soldiers with Russian troops and a notebook allegedly recovered from a battlefield.</p>

          <p>The jury in the trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has reached a partial verdict on four of five counts but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. Deliberations will resume after the judge urged jurors to continue their efforts to reach a unanimous decision on the charge, which carries a potential life sentence. The prosecution had requested an 'Allen charge' to encourage the hung jury to resolve their differences. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which include sex trafficking and racketeering, in a trial that has featured testimony from 34 witnesses over two months.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a halt to some planned weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns about the depletion of U.S. military stockpiles. The decision followed a Department of Defense review and was made to prioritize American interests as the war in Ukraine intensifies. While the specific munitions affected were not detailed, they are understood to include air defense missiles and precision munitions. The move represents a significant policy shift as the U.S. re-examines its approach to providing military aid while maintaining its own defense readiness, creating uncertainty for Ukrainian forces.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government suffered a significant political defeat after a large-scale rebellion from within his own party forced a U-turn on a key welfare reform bill. The chaotic events, which saw the government change its position multiple times, have been compared to the parliamentary turmoil of the Brexit era. The reversal on planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment has weakened Starmer's authority and led to questions about his leadership and the competence of his cabinet. This episode has created significant internal friction and raised doubts about the government's ability to manage its large majority.</p>

The figures are a stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, where daily apprehensions often exceeded this new monthly total.

These changes could negatively impact Tesla's vehicle sales and its energy division. In response, President Trump suggested Musk was upset about losing EV mandates and hinted at potential repercussions for Musk's other businesses, which receive substantial government contracts.

The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of personal health informationâ€”including names, addresses, and immigration statusâ€”violates federal privacy laws and creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking essential medical care. The data pertains to state-funded health programs for low-income immigrants. The suit seeks to halt further data sharing and compel the destruction of information already transferred to federal agencies for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following a fragile truce between Iran and Israel, the Iranian government is reportedly conducting a widespread hunt for individuals suspected of collaborating with Israel. According to activists and Iranian state media, hundreds of people have been detained in recent weeks as part of this internal crackdown. Some of those targeted are reportedly fleeing to neighboring countries like Turkey to escape arrest. This development highlights the intense internal security measures being implemented by Tehran in the aftermath of the recent military conflict, reflecting deep-seated suspicion and a drive to root out perceived internal threats.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032.
