            <p>Former US President Donald Trump stated his hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, suggesting it would lead to lucrative business opportunities with the United States. Trump urged both Kyiv and Moscow to show willingness to compromise. However, both sides accused each other of violating the Easter holiday ceasefire, with Ukraine reporting numerous instances of Russian shelling. Despite the broken truce, Trump remains optimistic about a potential agreement that could benefit all parties involved.</p>

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decrease, first-time home buyers have several avenues to achieve homeownership. Strategies include starting to save early and maximizing Lifetime ISA bonuses, which offer a 25% government top-up. Low-deposit mortgages, such as Yorkshire Building Society's £5,000 deposit mortgage and Skipton's Track Record mortgage, are also available, though they may come with higher rates. Shared ownership schemes allow buyers to purchase a share of a property and gradually increase their ownership, and income boost mortgages enable family members to increase borrowing power without becoming owners.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent study reveals that men are less likely to seek medical help than women, often delaying visits until symptoms become severe. This reluctance stems from societal pressures to "tough it out," fears of appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns. Many men prefer to self-manage their conditions, viewing help-seeking as a threat to their independence. Experts emphasize the importance of redesigning healthcare services to better meet men's needs and encourage early intervention, especially for mental health and potential cancer symptoms.</p>

            <p>The city of San José, California, is contemplating a controversial policy to arrest unhoused individuals who repeatedly refuse offers of shelter. Mayor Matt Mahan proposes issuing citations or warnings before resorting to arrest for trespassing violations, which would then be subject to behavioral health court. The city operates various temporary housing sites, but faces challenges in persuading unhoused people to accept available beds. Mahan emphasizes that this measure would be a last resort to address chronic homelessness and its impact on the community, while also providing opportunities for mental health and addiction treatment.</p>

Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely. The White House claimed the detainees were "foreign terrorists."
