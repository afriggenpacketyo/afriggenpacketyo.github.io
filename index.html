A pragmatic populism that avoids demonizing corporations while tackling economic inequality is proposed as a potential path forward.

          <p>A Republican-backed bill, the Save Act, aims to address the issue of noncitizen voting in US elections, despite a lack of evidence of widespread noncitizen voting.

Critics argue the bill is unnecessary, costly, and could disproportionately impact certain demographics.
