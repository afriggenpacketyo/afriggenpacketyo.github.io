          <p>Merck has lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing an expected $200 million hit from tariffs, primarily between the U.S. and China. The revised forecast also includes a charge related to a licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma, but does not account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. The company reaffirmed its sales forecast, and reported first-quarter revenue and profit that exceeded expectations due to strong performance in its oncology portfolio and animal health products. Sales from recently launched drugs like Winrevair and Capvaxive are expected to offset future losses from Keytruda losing exclusivity in 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has asserted that undocumented migrants should not be entitled to trials to challenge their deportation, arguing that the system cannot handle the volume of cases. He contends that many of those facing deportation are dangerous individuals, including killers and drug dealers. His comments come amid a legal battle over deportations and a temporary Supreme Court block on the administration's effort to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be gang members.</p>
