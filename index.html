          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated a controversial 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, testified in a closed-door deposition before the House Oversight Committee. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that the interview would be "hard-hitting," aiming to uncover why Epstein received what many victims consider a lenient agreement despite extensive warnings about his crimes. Acosta, who later served as Labor Secretary under President Trump and resigned over the controversy, has previously defended his actions in the case. The committee's investigation into the matter is described as serious and fast-moving.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as B2B2C, or "tariff hacking," to reduce the financial impact of trade war tariffs on consumers. This model involves routing online sales through a middleman company that purchases goods at a wholesale price, thereby paying a lower tariff than would be assessed on the final retail price. While this method has helped brands like Yours Clothing and Tod's Group avoid raising prices, some logistics experts warn it may be a short-term solution that could attract future regulatory scrutiny. The strategy highlights the creative measures businesses are taking to navigate complex global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

Aliyah Boston scored the game-winning basket with just 7.4 seconds remaining, capping a 7-0 run to close out the game. The victory was a significant achievement for the team, which many had counted out after Clark was sidelined.

          <p>Louisiana health officials have confirmed that a fifth person has died in 2025 after contracting Vibrio vulnificus, a rare flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters. People can become infected by exposing open wounds to contaminated water or consuming raw or undercooked seafood, such as oysters. The state has seen a significant increase in cases this year, with 26 documented infections, a rise experts attribute to warming ocean temperatures. This trend is not isolated to the Gulf Coast, as the bacteria is becoming more common further north.</p>

          <p>Jamie Hepburn has resigned from his position as a Scottish government minister after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The incident occurred after a parliamentary clash, where Ross alleged Hepburn grabbed him and swore aggressively. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that regardless of whether he breached the Ministerial Code, he felt his actions did not align with his personal code of practice.

          <p>A new initiative named DACH Against Hate has been launched in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland to address the sharp increase in antisemitism since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks. Founded by professor Guy Katz and supported by over 200 organizations, the group is petitioning for stricter legislation, improved education, and better protection for Jewish institutions. Prominent figures, including Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich, have warned that the Middle East conflict is being used as a pretext to fuel hatred. The initiative calls for decisive political action beyond speeches to ensure the safety of Jewish communities.</p>

This incident is the fourth such violation by Russia in 2025 and adds to escalating tensions between Russia and NATO members.

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapidly growing third-party online marketplace is rife with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers who use stolen business identities. The report suggests that in its push to compete with Amazon, Walmart relaxed its seller vetting processes, creating a "Wild West" environment where potentially dangerous fake items, like health supplements and beauty products, are sold to unsuspecting customers. While Walmart's e-commerce business has become profitable, this growth has come at the cost of consumer trust and safety. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its vetting for certain product categories.</p>

Shapiro stated Harris will "have to answer" for not publicly raising concerns about Joe Biden's fitness to campaign sooner. Buttigieg expressed surprise at Harris's claim that choosing him, a gay man, as her running mate would have been "too big a risk" for the ticket. The book details Harris's perspective on the turbulent 2024 campaign, including her process for selecting a vice-presidential nominee after replacing Biden.</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest has officially begun in Munich, with millions of visitors expected over the next two and a half weeks. A notable feature of this year's festival is the record-high price of beer, with a one-liter stein, or Mass, costing over €15 at most vendors. Alongside the traditional food and drink, the festival is also making strides in sustainability, aiming to be completely climate-neutral by 2028 by using green electricity and improving recycling. Organizers have also noted positive trends in visitor behavior, with a reported drop in offenses and binge drinking incidents in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new package of sanctions aimed at buyers of Russian oil, with a specific focus on entities in China. This 19th round of sanctions since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine seeks to further curtail Moscow's energy revenues, which have already fallen by 90% in Europe. The measures, which must be approved by all 27 EU member states, are also expected to include a ban on EU purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas. The move signals Europe's intent to close loopholes and increase economic pressure on Russia by targeting third-party enablers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to its highest point in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates earlier in the week. The yield rose to 4.135% as investors weighed the state of the economy and future monetary policy. This counterintuitive movement suggests that investors in longer-term debt are also considering factors like economic growth estimates and inflation, which are showing signs of ticking higher. The market's reaction indicates that concerns about government finances and the supply of debt may be outweighing the Fed's recent easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Vox article argues that the Trump administration's actions leading to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel represent a more severe assault on the First Amendment than previous controversies. The analysis refutes conservative claims that the administration's pressure on ABC is justified or comparable to the Biden administration's communications with social media firms about COVID misinformation. The article asserts that FCC Chair Brendan Carr's explicit threats to revoke broadcast licenses for content critical of the administration constitute direct government coercion aimed at silencing political dissent. This move, it concludes, sets a dangerous precedent for media freedom.</p>

The Taliban stated the pair had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal and practical challenges. Legal experts note that the president lacks the authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, a power that is reserved for foreign entities. Furthermore, antifa is not a formal organization but a decentralized movement, making it difficult to target. Critics argue that such a designation would be an attempt to prosecute an ideology, raising serious First Amendment concerns about free speech and association.</p>

          <p>A senior UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for military intervention to tackle illegal migration, a proposal UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected. Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders, and while the navy can assist if needed, the military's primary focus is on national defense.

Jon Stewart made a special appearance on "The Daily Show" to mock the decision, while Stephen Colbert, whose own show was recently canceled, called the suspension "blatant censorship." The controversy arose after Kimmel made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, leading to pressure from the FCC and major broadcast station owners.

The article notes that Ben & Jerry's had previously sued Unilever for allegedly obstructing its calls for a Gaza ceasefire.
