          <p>The United States and China have commenced high-level discussions in Geneva, Switzerland, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions that have escalated since President Trump imposed significant tariffs on imports earlier in the year. These negotiations mark the first known in-person contact between the world's two largest economies since the tariffs were enacted. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are participating alongside Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who is responsible for overseeing economic matters, as both sides seek to find common ground amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>As President Trump diminishes U.S. support for Ukraine, European leaders are concerned about their ability to supply Ukraine with necessary weaponry. Ukraine's Parliament approved a deal giving the U.S. a share of future revenue from natural resources, hoping to maintain American arms shipments. Ukrainian forces are reportedly running low on essential supplies like long-range missiles and air-defense systems. While European leaders are investing in weapons production, it may take a decade to reach sufficient output, leaving Ukraine reliant on American support in the short term. This article discusses the difficulties Ukraine is facing as US aid dwindles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly proposed bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the bill to allow research to align with the growing cannabis consumption in the United States. The EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that hinder federal funding for Schedule I substance research. Experts have mixed opinions on the bill's likelihood of passage, but some believe it could garner bipartisan support by prioritizing evidence over ideology.</p>

          <p>President Trump's White House has launched an aggressive media strategy characterized by crass language, flashy tactics, and outrageous social media posts. This approach, embracing viral far-right culture, aims to directly engage the Maga base and dominate the "attention economy." While it helps reshape narratives around key policy issues, critics warn that unchecked insults and lies undermine the decency and gravitas traditionally associated with presidential communications. The article examines how Trump's methods contrast with historical presidential communication strategies and the potential consequences of this new approach.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller stated that the US Constitution allows for the suspension of this legal liberty during times of rebellion or invasion. The administration cites challenges from judges regarding recent detentions of undocumented migrants and foreign students. Legal experts and critics have questioned the legality of such a move, arguing that the power to suspend habeas corpus lies with Congress, not the president.</p>

          <p>China has announced the development of a handheld device that it claims can detect cloaked stealth fighters. The device blends civilian telecoms technology with military-grade radar sensitivities. Researchers assert that it can detect stealth signals with 100% accuracy, even through electronic jamming. If effective, this technology could potentially impact the US-China arms race, given the widespread use of stealth technology in US military equipment.</p>
