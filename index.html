          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating a decline in the availability of compounded alternatives. The Danish pharmaceutical firm reported first-quarter sales below expectations due to competition from these alternative versions in the U.S. market. CEO Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen stated that the FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling would enable sales to recover, as compounded drugs lose their market foothold. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and telehealth partnerships to lower Wegovy costs and offer a safer alternative to compounders.</p>

          <p>India launched strikes on "terrorist infrastructure sites" within Pakistan, following a deadly attack in Kashmir, leading to casualties and escalating tensions between the two nations. Pakistan's military reported that Indian missiles killed at least 26 people and injured 46 others, characterizing it as an attack on civilian areas and announcing a retaliatory strike. India's Defense Ministry stated that its actions were "focused, measured and non-escalatory," targeting the roots of cross-border terror planning without targeting Pakistani military facilities. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry condemned the strikes as a violation of sovereignty and an attack on civilian-populated areas, prompting calls for restraint from the U.N. and Japan.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Brendan Buck argues that congressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are relying on a tax cut package to revitalize their political standing, which has been damaged by President Trump's tariffs. Buck suggests that extending the 2017 tax law may not be enough to counteract the economic harm caused by the tariffs. He highlights that while Republicans are selling the extension as tax cuts for everyone, it is essentially preserving existing rates, offering little new benefit to voters. Buck emphasizes that unless Republicans can convince Trump to reconsider his trade policy, the tax bill may not resonate with voters facing higher costs due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCSF indicates that psilocybin, found in "magic mushrooms," may improve mood, cognition, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients. The small study involved 12 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's who experienced depression and/or anxiety. They received two doses of psilocybin, and follow-ups revealed clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function. Researchers emphasize that this pilot study lacks a control group, and larger trials are underway to rigorously test psilocybin's effectiveness and understand its mechanisms of action, while cautioning patients against self-medicating with psychedelics.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are considering cutting Medicaid provider taxes to help fund an extension of President Trump's tax cuts, a move that could significantly impact hospitals, particularly in rural areas. These taxes, paid by hospitals, help states cover Medicaid costs and draw additional federal matching funds, benefiting facilities like Lincoln Health in Colorado.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns that President Trump's tariffs could fuel inflation and hinder economic growth. Despite Trump's calls for lower rates, the Fed is likely to maintain its benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. Trump's recent tariffs on imports from China have raised concerns about inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. While trade tensions have dampened consumer confidence, the job market remains relatively stable, and inflation has been moderate, leaving the Fed in a challenging position as it navigates the potential economic fallout from the tariffs.</p>

The name "alcatraz" is derived from Arabic, meaning pelican or diving bird, and has evolved over time to be associated with burden and isolation.

          <h2>China Announces Policy Easing Measures to Counter Trade War Impact</h2>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to bolster economic growth amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rate and lower mortgage rates under the housing provident fund. These measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as stimulate consumption and elderly care. Analysts suggest that while these steps indicate urgency, their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited, and further fiscal measures may be needed.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs, which have increased import duties to over 180%. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, paid $3.1 million in tariffs during a one-month period. The tariffs have made it financially unviable to continue importing from China, leading to cancelled orders and no plans for new orders. Fully manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. is deemed too expensive, leaving the company struggling to remain competitive.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages. The change aims to open up opportunities for school and college leavers, with the Rail Safety and Standards Board stating that research indicates 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The move is intended to reduce disruptions to rail services caused by a lack of available drivers, particularly as a significant portion of the current workforce approaches retirement age.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump suggested that the opportunity for Russia to participate in the 2026 World Cup could serve as an "incentive" for the country to end its war in Ukraine.

Trump, who previously campaigned on ending the war, implied that allowing Russia to play in the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico, could motivate a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Under a new bill, criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing could face an additional two years in prison. This measure aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, as expressed by victims' families whose loved ones' killers refused to attend sentencing hearings. The bill would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those removed for disruptive behavior, and would also allow for restrictions on privileges for offenders already facing whole life orders. Supporters believe the bill is a step in the right direction for victims' families.</p>
