          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed thousands of acres in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, leading to mandatory evacuations in Ocean and Lacey townships. The fire, which started on Tuesday morning, has forced around 3,000 residents to evacuate and shut down major roads like the Garden State Parkway. As of Wednesday morning, the fire was only 10% contained, threatening over 1,300 structures and causing power outages for approximately 25,000 homes and businesses. Firefighters are working to establish containment lines and conduct backfiring operations; no injuries have been reported so far.</p>

The digest also notes that no Cabinet members visited the Yasukuni shrine during a spring festival, partly due to diplomatic considerations, although Ishiba sent an offering. The Osaka Expo reached one million visitors within 11 days, and TEPCO retrieved a second melted fuel sample from the Fukushima reactor. Ishiba will visit Vietnam and the Philippines to strengthen ties, while Japanese automakers unveiled new EVs at the Shanghai motor show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the United States is increasingly embracing the concept of fetal personhood, advocating for laws that treat fetuses as people and potentially subject women who have abortions to homicide charges. This shift is driven by a growing alliance with the Republican party and a focus on punishing wrongdoers. While most Americans support legal abortion in some circumstances, the anti-abortion movement is becoming more hardline and focused on influencing judges rather than voters. This approach includes pushing for restrictions on IVF and other reproductive technologies.</p>

Goldman Sachs projects that gold prices could rise further to $3,700 by the end of 2025, particularly if central banks continue buying gold at a high rate.

The company alleges these sites are mass-marketing slightly different versions to circumvent FDA rules and selling unstudied formulations, such as oral tablets.
