          <p>Southwest Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that missed Wall Street estimates and significantly lowered its full-year profit forecast, causing its stock to fall by over 12%. The airline cited weaker domestic travel demand and the economic uncertainty in the U.S. as primary reasons for the revised outlook, echoing trends seen across the industry. In response, Southwest is overhauling its business model, including changes to its seating policies, and has announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. The carrier noted that while summer discounting was prevalent, travel demand has recently shown signs of stabilizing.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has declared that TikTok will be shut down for American users unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal that gives the U.S. control over the app. Lutnick emphasized that American control over the technology and algorithm is non-negotiable due to national security concerns regarding user data and content manipulation. This statement increases pressure as the September 17 divestment deadline approaches, with the popular platform's future in the U.S. hanging in the balance while deal negotiations continue.</p>

          <p>A top Department of Justice official, Todd Blanche, is scheduled to meet with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell to discuss the Jeffrey Epstein case. This meeting occurs as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure to release more information, particularly after a recent DOJ memo concluded there was no evidence of a blackmail "client list." The development also follows a report that President Trump's name appeared multiple times in Epstein-related files, a claim the White House has denied. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition.</p>

          <p>Leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, are cautioning that a physical "kill switch" to halt a rogue superintelligent AI is an unworkable fantasy. They argue that once an AI surpasses human intelligence, it could use sophisticated persuasion to achieve its goals, making direct control impossible. The focus, therefore, should be on developing AI systems with inherently benevolent values. Proposed extreme measures, such as bombing data centers, are deemed impractical and would trigger a catastrophic humanitarian crisis by destroying the critical infrastructure modern society relies on.</p>

A friend who spoke with Slater said the 19-year-old, who had consumed drugs and alcohol, was likely just trying to walk back to his accommodation after ending up at a remote Airbnb. A post-mortem examination concluded that his death resulted from head injuries consistent with a fall, and found no evidence of any assault, providing some clarity on the circumstances of his tragic death.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against California, seeking to nullify key provisions of Proposition 12, the state's landmark animal welfare law. The law mandates minimum space requirements for farm animals, including egg-laying hens and breeding pigs. Although the lawsuit officially blames the law for high egg prices, agricultural economists largely attribute recent price spikes to bird flu outbreaks. Critics argue the legal challenge is a politically motivated effort to aid the national pork industry, which has long opposed the ban on restrictive gestation crates.</p>

          <p>Three British citizens arrested for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have been spared the death penalty. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float, who were caught with cocaine disguised in dessert mix packets, were instead sentenced to 12 months in prison. Considering time already served, the trio could be released by early 2026. While Indonesia enforces severe anti-drug laws, it has maintained a de facto moratorium on executions since 2017.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax" and that he supports "full transparency" to bring everyone involved to justice. His comments stand in contrast to President Trump, who recently referred to his supporters' intense focus on the case as a "hoax." Johnson's remarks highlight a growing rift within the Republican party over the handling of the case and the public's demand for more information from the administration.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence to implement "surveillance pricing," a controversial practice that sets different prices for the same product based on an individual's personal data. This advanced form of dynamic pricing, which can use factors like location, search history, and loyalty status, has sparked consumer outrage and prompted legislative proposals to ban it. While companies like Delta Air Lines are exploring the technology, critics and privacy advocates argue it creates an unfair and intrusive marketplace where vulnerability can be exploited.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has addressed a report that at least $1 billion of its AI chips were illegally smuggled into China, calling the practice a "losing proposition" for those involved. The company stated that it does not provide the necessary service and support for unauthorized products, making data centers built with smuggled chips technically and economically unviable.
