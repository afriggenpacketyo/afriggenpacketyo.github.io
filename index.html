          <p>General Motors has issued a recall for 597,630 full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential manufacturing defect in the V8 engines, specifically within the connecting rod or crankshaft components, which could lead to sudden engine failure and increase the risk of a crash. The recall affects models from 2021 to 2024, including Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500. Dealers will inspect the engines and provide necessary repairs or replacements free of charge, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed out on June 9, 2025, and the recall is in response to an investigation by U.S. auto safety regulators following numerous complaints of engine failure in GM vehicles.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture depicting the attempted assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in Butler, PA, was displayed in the Oval Office. The artwork captures the moment when then-candidate Trump was pulled off stage by Secret Service agents after shots were fired near him. The sculpture, a maquette of a larger statue planned by artist Stan Watts, symbolizes Trump's resilience and bravery during the 2024 presidential election. The image of Trump shouting "Fight! Fight!

          <p>India and Pakistan initially agreed to a ceasefire after escalating military operations, including missile and drone attacks, but explosions were reported in Indian-administered Kashmir shortly after the announcement. President Trump announced the ceasefire, attributing it to U.S.-brokered talks, though this claim was disputed by Indian officials, who stated the deal was worked out directly between the two countries. Despite the conflicting accounts, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his role in facilitating the agreement, emphasizing its importance for regional peace and stability.

          <p>Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital reached a $750 million settlement with victims of gynecologist Robert Hadden, who sexually assaulted patients over two decades. The settlement, totaling nearly $1 billion, raises questions about how Hadden was able to continue his abuse for so long, despite alleged knowledge of his behavior by the institutions. Victims, like Laurie Maldonado and Eva Santos Veloz, share their traumatic experiences and emphasize the need for institutions to prioritize patient safety over protecting serial predators.

The article discusses how some universities are attempting to resist these attacks, including faculty senates passing resolutions in favor of mutual defense compacts to support one another. However, these resolutions are nonbinding, and administrations have yet to respond, highlighting the difficulties of taking a public stance in a repressive climate.

          <p>An excerpt from Barry Diller's memoir, "Who Knew," shares his perspective on the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on research or structured information. He highlights the success of projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were greenlit based on gut feeling rather than extensive analysis. Diller argues that too much information can complicate and obscure the essence of a good idea, advocating for the value of common sense and human instinct.</p>

The loss of coastal resting spots due to floods and ocean acidification, which affects crustaceans, is diminishing crucial food sources.

          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, causing tremors felt in Atlanta and parts of North Carolina. The earthquake had its epicenter just outside of Greenback, Tennessee, but was felt as far away as Atlanta. There were only a few instances of light damage reported around the epicenter, and no reports of moderate or heavy damage, according to those who self-reported to the Geological Survey. The last time a strong earthquake was felt in the region was 2018, when a 4.4 magnitude tremor rattled houses but caused little damage.</p>
