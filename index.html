          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. Support for space exploration is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that most people believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor and that the space program contributes to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>A new law has introduced a $250 "visa integrity fee" applicable to millions of visitors with nonimmigrant visas, such as students and temporary workers. The fee is part of a larger spending bill and is intended to be reimbursable if visa holders comply with all regulations, including timely departure. However, immigration advocates have criticized the measure, along with a new $100 fee for asylum seekers, for creating additional financial barriers to legal pathways into the United States.</p>

          <p>Reality television personality Teddi Mellencamp is sharing her story to raise awareness about advocating for one's own health after a critical oversight in her cancer journey. She revealed that because her previous melanoma diagnoses were low-stage, doctors allegedly decided to forgo full-body scans. Mellencamp believes this was a major misstep that allowed the cancer to metastasize, and she is now urging others to be proactive and question their medical care to ensure they receive comprehensive monitoring and treatment.</p>

          <p>A complex prisoner swap has resulted in the freedom of ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating 252 Venezuelans, alleged to be gang members, who had been deported from the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison. Among the freed Americans is former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, whose family stated he was an innocent man used as a political pawn. The successful exchange highlights a warming relationship between the U.S. and Salvadoran governments.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered the city of Los Angeles to pay $48.8 million to a man who has been in a coma since being hit by a city sanitation truck in a crosswalk last year. The city admitted its driver was at fault but disputed the extent of the damages, arguing the man's comatose state minimized his pain and suffering. The victim's attorneys criticized the City Attorney for refusing to settle the case, which resulted in one of the largest liability payouts for the city in recent years.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Amber Weather Warning for Thunderstorms and Potential Flash Floods</h2>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for southeast England, bracing the region for torrential rain and thunderstorms. Forecasters predict that more than a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, creating a significant risk of dangerous flash flooding. The danger is heightened because the ground is currently parched from a recent heatwave, which will reduce its ability to absorb the sudden downpour, likely leading to rapid surface water runoff and disruption.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on 18 officers and three military intelligence units from Russia's GRU espionage agency. The Foreign Office stated the action was a response to a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity" aimed at destabilizing Europe. The targeted activities included attacks on UK media, telecommunications, energy infrastructure, and political institutions. This move is described as the largest UK action against Russian spies since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings and aligns with broader European efforts to pressure Moscow.</p>
