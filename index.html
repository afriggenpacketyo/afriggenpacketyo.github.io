        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to hold intense ministerial-level tariff discussions around mid-May, following "progress" in initial talks. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief negotiator, highlighted the deepening discussions on nontariff barriers, bilateral trade expansion, and economic security cooperation. Japan is expected to offer proposals including increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans to offset decreased exports to China, and simplifying import screening for U.S. cars. The Trump administration's tariffs on goods imported from Japan are currently paused until early July, but Japan continues to face universal tariffs and sector-based levies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the removal of Temporary Protected Status (T.P.S.) for Venezuelan immigrants, a program allowing individuals from countries facing disasters or instability to live and work legally in the U.S. A federal judge previously blocked the administration's plan, citing procedural violations and potential racial bias, arguing that terminating T.P.S. would cause irreparable harm and economic disruption. The administration argues that the law creating T.P.S. bars judicial review of executive decisions regarding its termination. The Supreme Court has addressed other immigration policy challenges, including cases involving wrongful deportations and the Alien Enemies Act. </p>

          <p>Block's first-quarter earnings missed Wall Street expectations, leading to a significant drop in stock value. The company cited challenging economic conditions and the impact of tariffs on imported goods as reasons for a weaker-than-expected profit outlook for the second quarter and full year. Gross payment volume also fell short of forecasts, although CFO Amrita Ahuja emphasized that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever due to increased efficiency. Despite competition in the payment sector, Square gained market share in key verticals, while Cash App continues to expand its financial services offerings, including the rollout of Afterpay integration and the Borrow program.

          <p>China has announced it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations, potentially opening the door for talks to resolve the ongoing trade war. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times, seeking to initiate discussions on tariffs. China reiterated its demand for the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs as a sign of sincerity, warning that failure to do so would undermine mutual trust. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on imported Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies from China, with both sides granting exemptions on critical products.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a new soda tax, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, despite a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax, approved by voters in November, applies to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a certain calorie count. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, while opponents argue it unfairly burdens working families. The tax excludes certain beverages, such as those for medical use and 100% natural juices.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's Governor Kevin Stitt and State Superintendent of Schools Ryan Walters are at odds over collecting student immigration data. Walters supports collecting and sharing the data with federal authorities, citing President Trump's executive order, while Stitt believes the administration is not requesting such information and opposes the proposal. Stitt has replaced three Oklahoma State Board of Education members after Walters proposed checking students' immigration status. A White House official stated that the administration does not want undocumented immigrants or gangs to take refuge in schools but clarified that there is no directive for agents to enter schools.</p>

          <p>Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has proposed an increase in the film tax credit to stay competitive with New Jersey and other states. New York has spent more than $5.5 billion in incentives since 2017. Each New York household has contributed about $16 in taxes, on average, toward producing the drama series “Billions” since 2017. Over that period, each household has also paid roughly $14.50 in production incentives for “Saturday Night Live” and $4.60 for “The Irishman,” among many other shows and movies.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione's lawyers are seeking to dismiss his state murder charges in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, arguing that the state case and a federal death penalty prosecution amount to double jeopardy. They are also requesting the dismissal of terrorism charges and suppression of evidence collected during Mangione's arrest. The defense argues that officers questioned him without Miranda warnings and searched his property without a warrant. Prosecutors say Mangione apologized to officers and expressed concern for a McDonald's employee who alerted them to his whereabouts.</p>

          <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks discussed the company's strategy to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs on China, a major supplier. Hasbro is rapidly diversifying its supply chain, aiming to source 40% of its products outside of China by the end of 2026, with manufacturing shifting to countries including the U.S., Turkey, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. While China will remain an important sourcing location, Hasbro expects to diversify production even in specialized categories over time. Cocks anticipates price increases due to tariffs but believes Hasbro's sourcing flexibility will help mitigate losses.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting faces criticism for changes to maternity funding, with campaigners questioning his commitment to maternity safety. Following a report into poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested annually into improving maternity safety. However, recent changes mean that only £2m of the funding is guaranteed for maternity care this year, with the rest allocated to Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) to decide how best to spend it. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have labeled the decision as a betrayal and a wrecking ball to maternity safety, fearing budget cuts.</p>
