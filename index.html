          <p>This article examines the current monthly payments for a $60,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. It compares today's costs to previous periods, highlighting the financial benefits of securing such a loan in the current economic climate. The piece also explores the flexibility of a HELOC, where payments are only required on the amount used, and discusses how potential future rate cuts could make it an even more affordable borrowing option for homeowners.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the transnational gang Barrio 18 as a foreign terrorist organization. This classification places the group, which operates in Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador, alongside entities such as MS-13 and ISIS. The designation is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to dismantle cartels and gangs, which has included using this status to justify military actions against drug trafficking operations and has been a subject of debate among lawmakers.</p>

Separately, the President abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with top congressional Democrats regarding government funding, deeming their proposals "unserious and ridiculous" as the shutdown deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>South Dakota state Representative Peri Pourier has officially changed her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, a move that reduces the number of Democrats in the state's House to just five. Pourier, who is Oglala Lakota, stated that the core principles of the Republican Party, such as decentralized government and self-determination, better align with the concept of tribal sovereignty. She criticized past Democratic policies like the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 for imposing a one-size-fits-all governance model that undermined traditional systems.</p>

          <p>A group of 34 Palestinian students, who hold fully funded scholarships at UK universities, have been successfully evacuated from Gaza to begin their studies. This marks the first time since the war began that students have been officially helped to leave the territory for educational purposes in the UK. While celebrating this opportunity, supporters highlight the difficult circumstances the students and their families continue to face, and also criticize UK government rules that prevent them from bringing family members with them.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists, infections from highly drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" increased by nearly 70% in the United States between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort treatments like carbapenems. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to a rise in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic and warn that the spread could make common infections like UTIs much harder to treat.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications for high-skilled foreign workers. While the fee is intended to curb misuse of the program by outsourcing firms, critics argue it will have severe negative consequences. The policy is expected to hinder scientific research at universities and non-profits, which often operate on tight budgets, and could reduce the overall supply of top-tier global talent, ultimately undermining American innovation and long-term economic growth.</p>

          <p>A Missouri woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, has been sentenced to more than four years in prison for her role in a sophisticated scheme to fraudulently sell Elvis Presley's iconic Graceland estate. Findley pleaded guilty to mail fraud, admitting to creating a fake investment company and forging documents to claim that Presley's late daughter, Lisa Marie, had used Graceland as collateral for a non-existent loan. The plot was thwarted when Elvis Presley Enterprises challenged the claim and an actress, Riley Keough, took legal action.</p>

Now equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, the typhoon is barreling towards southern China's Guangdong province, where authorities have evacuated hundreds of thousands of people and issued warnings for catastrophic storm surges and flooding.</p>
