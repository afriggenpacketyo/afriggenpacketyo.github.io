        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mexico conducted its first judicial elections, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor to overhaul the judicial system, which they view as corrupt and inefficient. Critics argue that the vote will politicize the judiciary, exacerbating crime and gang violence in the country. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared low, with many voters expressing confusion and a lack of information about the numerous candidates, with some voters feeling pressured to vote and others disillusioned with the system. Optimism for the new process is low considering the public's relative lack of engagement in the process.</p>

          <p>Six people were injured in what the FBI is calling a "targeted act of violence" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails, yelling "free Palestine" during the attack. The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, were outside the Boulder County Courthouse, with one in critical condition.

          <p>China refuted claims from Washington that it had violated the Geneva trade agreement, instead accusing the U.S. of breaching deal terms, escalating tensions between the two economic superpowers. The Trump administration has increased export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals to China, and announced it would revoke visas for Chinese students, drawing ire from Beijing. China, meanwhile, has kept a firm grip on its rare earths exports, contrary to Washington's expectations. These measures "seriously undermine" the deal reached in Geneva, according to a Chinese commerce department spokesperson, signaling a deterioration in bilateral economic relations.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strongly denied firing on Palestinians at a Gaza humanitarian site, amid reports of casualties during aid distribution. The IDF released drone footage purportedly showing armed individuals shooting at civilians, claiming Hamas is disrupting aid efforts. Witnesses reported Israeli forces fired on crowds near an aid site, but the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) refuted these accounts. Israel maintains that Hamas routinely prevents aid from reaching civilians and deliberately endangers them, but the situation remains contentious and difficult to verify due to limited independent access.</p>

          <p>Ukraine claims to have conducted its largest long-range attack of the war, using smuggled drones to strike 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases, with the SBU security service orchestrating the operation. Russia confirmed Ukrainian attacks in five regions, labeling them a "terrorist act", with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claiming 117 drones were used, hitting "34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers". These attacks occurred as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators prepared for a second round of peace talks in Istanbul, although expectations for significant breakthroughs remain low due to the vast differences in the two sides' positions. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities reported a massive drone and missile attack on its territory, injuring at least six people in Kharkiv.</p>

The MLS Players Association supports the protest, arguing that FIFA's new tournament increases player workload without adequate compensation. MLS teams will receive significant amounts to participate, but players are only entitled to 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million per team, leading to an unequal distribution of prize money. The MLSPA has sought meetings with MLS to address the arrangement, but the league has not provided a reasonable proposal.</p>

          <p>More than 50 people were killed and scores wounded near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and multiple witnesses. The Israeli military denies involvement, citing an initial inquiry indicating its forces did not fire at civilians near the site. Witnesses reported gunfire from multiple directions, while the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) dismissed reports of deaths and chaos around its sites. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks falter, with Israel and Hamas trading blame for the lack of progress.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado fears that Nicolás Maduro will respond to U.S. restrictions on Chevron's operations by unleashing a new wave of internal repression. Machado, who is in hiding within Venezuela, believes Maduro's regime is increasingly isolated internationally and faces an unsustainable economic crisis. She praised the U.S. decision to partially revoke Chevron's license, hoping it will limit resources available to the regime while maintaining minimal operations for a future democratic transition. Despite the economic challenges and low voter turnout in recent legislative elections, Maduro still maintains support from the military and faces a divided opposition.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, the founder of the XPrize Foundation, expressed optimism about the future of AI and biotechnology despite geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. Diamandis emphasized the universality of human biology, math, physics, and chemistry, suggesting that breakthroughs in one country can benefit scientists globally. He contrasted this vision with the Trump administration's policies, which have included curbing international student visas and cutting scientific funding. Diamandis voiced concern over these cuts, particularly at the National Institutes of Health, stating they could have long-term implications for the pace of scientific discoveries, while also emphasizing the need to see the world in a positive fashion.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively to deliver courses, due to financial challenges in the higher education sector. Universities are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about violating business laws, potentially leading to course closures and mergers. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed support for collaboration where possible. The report suggests that neighboring universities should be allowed to coordinate course offerings to avoid duplication and ensure cost-effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from "going missing" from schools and GPs, due to widespread family displacement across England. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure all authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, the highest number on record. A government spokesperson said that they are investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation, driving up housing standards and delivering on our commitment to build more social and affordable homes.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, sparking controversy and criticism from the U.S. and local political groups. The government claims the law is necessary to increase black ownership of land, with compensation paid in most cases. Experts say expropriation without compensation would be rare, primarily for unused land held for speculative purposes or abandoned land. The move aims to restore land to those dispossessed during white-minority rule, but faces legal challenges and political opposition.</p>
