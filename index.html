          <p>According to a TechInsights report, Huawei Technologies is still struggling to advance to the 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process, which highlights the impact of U.S. sanctions. The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop features Huaweiâ€™s Kirin X90 system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by SMIC using its 7-nm process node. This finding refutes speculation that Huawei had made the leap to SMICâ€™s 5-nm process, which faces scaling challenges due to U.S. sanctions. Huawei's slow progress in securing 5-nm chips means the company is several generations behind its U.S. rivals, such as Apple, whose M-series chips have been using TSMCâ€™s 3-nm process for two years.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stated it will respond forcefully to what it calls a severe violation of the ceasefire by Iran, which allegedly launched missiles toward Israel shortly after a ceasefire agreement was announced. While Iranian state television denied these missile launches, the IDF maintains that the Iranian regime carried out the attack. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has instructed the IDF to respond with powerful strikes against regime targets in Tehran. This comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a bilateral ceasefire following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and President Donald Trump's announcement that all sides had agreed to the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has committed the UK to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. Of this, 3.5% will be allocated to core defense, and 1.5% to defense-related areas, such as resilience and security. This split target aims to accommodate US President Donald Trump's call for increased defense spending while providing flexibility for EU countries. The Conservative party has criticized the plan as unfunded and distant, while Sir Keir emphasized the need for agility and a clear national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty.</p>

The summit is expected to address the recent conflict and Trump's push for increased defense spending across NATO member nations, aiming to raise it from 2% to 5% of GDP.

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are backing an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, expressing concerns about cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits.

Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden insists on the necessity of reform, citing the projected doubling of long-term sickness and disability benefit recipients.

The bill also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. This effort builds on recent bipartisan momentum in the Senate, following the passage of a stablecoin bill.</p>

          <p>A study by the Cologne-based retail research institute EHI reveals that shoplifting is increasing in Germany, with senior citizens and families stealing more frequently. In 2024, the value of stolen goods reached approximately â‚¬2.95 billion, a 4.6% increase compared to 2023. Experts attribute this rise to more people being unable to afford certain products and protesting high prices, as well as the increasing prevalence of self-service checkouts in retail stores. The study surveyed 98 companies with over 17,000 shops to gather data on inventory discrepancies.</p>

          <p>Iran launched missiles at the largest US military base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid, located in Qatar, in retaliation for recent American strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. The attack, confirmed by Iranian state media and later by the military, prompted the US and UK to advise their citizens in Qatar to shelter in place. President Donald Trump described the attack as "very weak," noting that no Americans were harmed and little damage was done, while also mentioning that Iran had given the US early notice of the attack. Israel publicly agreed to Trump's ceasefire proposal, and Iran stated it would cease attacks if Israel did the same.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quickly corrected after claiming that President Donald Trump originated the motto "peace through strength." Leavitt stated that Trump's attack on Iran's nuclear facilities demonstrated the "strength" that his predecessors lacked and that he invented the foreign policy doctrine. However, the phrase has been used in American politics for decades, notably by Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, and dates back to the Roman Empire. Critics on social media promptly corrected Leavitt's inaccurate assertion.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its online search services to increase consumer choice. The CMA is investigating Google under a new law that allows the regulator to demand changes from firms with excessive market power. Potential changes include choice screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers whose content appears in search results. Google, which accounts for over 90% of UK searches, expressed concerns that the proposed changes could have significant implications for businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that Sean "Diddy" Combs' decision not to call any witnesses in his federal trial for sex crimes reflects a calculated risk based on the prosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. By not calling witnesses, the defense aims to emphasize perceived weaknesses in the prosecution's case and avoid potential damaging testimony. Experts note that Diddy's decision not to testify prevents the prosecution from reiterating their case and subjecting him to a potentially humiliating cross-examination. The trial, which began in May, is nearing its conclusion, with closing arguments expected to begin soon.</p>
