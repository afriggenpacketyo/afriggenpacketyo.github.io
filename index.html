          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations and sparked multiple grass fires covering approximately 80 acres. Two individuals were treated for injuries, but officials have not yet confirmed any fatalities as recovery efforts are hampered by ongoing small explosions from undetonated fireworks. Family members of the missing, including some who had just started working at the facility, are anxiously awaiting news while authorities investigate the cause of the blast.</p>

          <p>A large forest fire on the Greek island of Crete has led to the evacuation of four settlements, including the popular resort of Achlia. The blaze, which began Wednesday and was intensified by strong winds, has forced at least 1,500 people to move to temporary shelters. Over 150 firefighters are battling the flames on the island's south coast, though water-dropping aircraft were grounded overnight. While some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties, no serious injuries have been reported as authorities work to contain the difficult fire amid a broader European heatwave.</p>

          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying 15 people for a skydiving trip crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey. The pilot reported engine trouble before attempting to return to the airport and crashing in a wooded area. Miraculously, there were no fatalities, though injuries ranged from minor to severe, with some individuals covered in jet fuel. An investigation revealed that the same plane was involved in a 2023 incident where it sustained substantial damage during a landing, which the NTSB attributed to the pilot's inadequate landing flare.</p>

The vote was held open for hours as leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump himself, scrambled to persuade a handful of Republican holdouts. The opposition stems from both conservative members concerned about the bill's spending and moderates unhappy with Senate changes, particularly deeper cuts to Medicaid. This gridlock jeopardizes the self-imposed July 4 deadline for passing the signature tax and spending package.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has admitted fault in his government's handling of flagship welfare reforms, acknowledging he "did not engage" properly with his own Labour MPs. The admission follows a chaotic period where the government was forced into major U-turns on proposed changes to disability benefits to avoid a significant rebellion from over 120 of its own lawmakers. This episode has gutted the bill of its key measures and raised questions about Starmer's authority and policy coherence, while also impacting the chancellor's spending plans by delaying or losing billions in potential savings.</p>

The gangs are creating parallel governance structures, paralyzing legal commerce, and causing prices of essential goods to soar. This crisis, deepening since the 2021 presidential assassination, has led to a rise in vigilante groups and threatens a total collapse of the state without stronger international intervention.</p>

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that his sustained excellence and longevity establish him as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. While Koufax had a period of unparalleled dominance, his career was much shorter. The author contends that Kershaw's 18 seasons of elite performance, leading to more wins and strikeouts, outweigh his postseason struggles, which occurred over a much larger sample size of games. Kershaw's enduring presence and professionalism are cited as foundational to the team's modern golden age.</p>

          <p>Armenia is looking to deepen its relationship with China and elevate it to a strategic partnership, according to Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan during a visit to Beijing. This move is part of Armenia's broader effort to diversify its foreign relations beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. The shift follows dissatisfaction with Moscow's failure to intervene in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent conflicts with Azerbaijan. Mirzoyan stated that both nations have expressed a mutual interest in officially upgrading their diplomatic ties, signaling a new direction for the South Caucasus nation.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years each. Combs, who had been in detention since his arrest, reacted with emotion and relief in the courtroom. The split verdict concluded a high-profile trial that featured graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion within his enterprise.</p>

          <p>With the House of Representatives operating on a razor-thin Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more relevant. According to House rules, if a vote on a question results in a tie, the measure is considered lost and fails to pass. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedural reality was highlighted in a 2024 vote on impeaching a cabinet secretary and is a critical factor in the current struggle to pass President Trump's spending bill.</p>

New listing volume surged to $14 billion in the first half of the year, driven by a wave of mainland Chinese companies seeking to raise capital. This boom is fueled by several factors, including supportive policies from Beijing, ample liquidity from mainland investors, and concerns over potential U.S. delistings. High-profile secondary listings, such as that of battery giant CATL, have highlighted the city's renewed appeal for fundraising. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk.

Experts point out that many naturalized citizens, who played by the rules of a broken immigration system, reacted negatively to what they perceived as permissive border policies.
