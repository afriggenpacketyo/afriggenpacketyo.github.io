          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 04:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed suppliers to cease production of its China-specific H20 general processing units following Beijing's crackdown on purchases due to alleged security concerns. This directive comes after the Chinese government urged local tech companies to stop buying these chips, casting doubt on their return to the Chinese market despite earlier U.S. export license approvals. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged discussions with Beijing regarding "backdoors" and emphasized the chips' commercial, not military, use. The situation highlights the challenges faced by Nvidia amid U.S.-China trade tensions, potentially jeopardizing over $20 billion in annual sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions across the UK are bracing for significant travel disruption this bank holiday weekend due to a combination of busy roads, a CrossCountry rail strike over pay and safety, and extensive engineering works. The RAC predicts heavy traffic, especially on the M5, with 17.6 million holiday trips expected by car. Major events like Notting Hill Carnival and Reading/Leeds festivals will draw large crowds, further straining transport networks. Passengers are advised to check their journeys in advance, as limited rail services and potential road delays are anticipated across the country.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees pet dogs playing prominent roles in weddings, often serving as ring bearers, flower girls, or honored guests. Couples like Ellie and Brad, who involved their sheepadoodle Newton in their ceremony, highlight the joy and emotional support pets bring to such special occasions. Dog chaperone services are expanding to meet this demand, helping integrate pets seamlessly into the day's events, from meet-and-greets to mini-grooming. This reflects a broader societal shift where dogs are increasingly viewed as integral family members, with their presence often stealing the show.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's prolonged and intense summer heatwave, driven by global warming, has led to a nearly 60% surge in Chinese air conditioner exports to the continent in July. Capitals like Madrid and Paris experienced record temperatures, exposing Europe's general unpreparedness for such extreme heat. This demand boom is significantly benefiting Chinese brands, which already dominate approximately 80% of the global AC market. The article underscores how climate change is reshaping consumer markets and international trade dynamics, creating new opportunities for manufacturers.</p>

The UK-based company reported a 9% revenue increase to $1.4 billion and a 4% rise in pre-tax profit to $683.6 million in its 2024 financial year. User and creator accounts saw substantial growth, driving the platform's "significant growth and profitability."

          <p>An explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Karachi, Pakistan, resulted in at least four fatalities and over 30 injuries on Thursday. The blast ignited a fire that engulfed the warehouse and adjacent shops, also damaging nearby vehicles. Authorities have arrested two warehouse owners, suspecting the illegal storage of over 50 kilograms of raw materials used for fireworks and potentially bombs. This incident highlights ongoing infrastructure and safety challenges in Pakistan's financial capital, drawing parallels to a similar fatal explosion in Punjab province earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Scientific Reports indicates an exponential increase in whale and dolphin strandings along the Scottish coastline over the past three decades. Researchers from the University of Glasgow analyzed data from 1992 to 2022, identifying common dolphins and baleen whales as species showing particularly steep rises in strandings, especially among juveniles. This concerning trend suggests unprecedented pressures on these marine mammals in Scottish waters. Experts emphasize the need for targeted conservation efforts, viewing these animals as "sentinels of the ocean" whose distress signals potential changes in the marine environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a five-day losing streak as investors anxiously awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium for clues on future interest rate policy. Despite repeated calls from Donald Trump for rate cuts, the Fed has held steady, while European central banks have already made several cuts. Senior Fed officials expressed caution regarding rate reductions, citing concerns over inflation, which is being impacted by Trump's tariffs. The market's anticipation underscores the high stakes of Powell's address, especially with his tenure nearing its end. (not investment advice)</p>

While Menendez took responsibility for his crimes and his family supported his release, the panel determined he still posed an "unreasonable risk of danger to society." He must wait three years before his next hearing, as his brother Lyle's parole hearing is scheduled for the following day.</p>

Honda similarly attributed price changes to added feature content and its high percentage of American-made vehicles.

This ruling enables the administration to align federal funding with its policy objectives, which include canceling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-related grants. While the legal challenge from 16 states and research groups will continue, the immediate effect is a significant setback for research in these areas, despite lower court findings of "no reasoned decision-making" by NIH.</p>
