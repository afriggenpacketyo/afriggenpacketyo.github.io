          <p>In an interview, Navy veteran Jack McCain addressed the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the ongoing risks faced by Afghan pilots and crews who assisted the U.S. military. He emphasized the moral obligation of the United States to evacuate and care for those who fought alongside them, including interpreters and ground troops, and criticized the lack of planning during the withdrawal. McCain also highlighted the dangers faced by women under the Taliban regime and disagreed with the Homeland Security's assessment that it is safe for Afghans to return. He urged lawmakers to increase the number of Special Immigrant Visas and to solve the problems they have created, emphasizing the need for humanity and national honor.</p>

          <p>Iranian regime media outlets are praising Elias Rodriguez, the suspect in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., referring to him as "our dear brother." The articles glorify the suspect's actions, with one newspaper questioning the whereabouts of Rodriguez, who allegedly stated he committed the murders "for Palestine...for Gaza." This comes as the Trump administration considers an interim nuclear agreement with Iran, raising concerns about trusting the regime. Experts warn that the glorification of the murders demonstrates the Iranian regime's continued support for antisemitism and terrorism.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, initially pulled Arias-Cristobal over for an alleged traffic violation, which was later dropped. However, due to her immigration status, she was turned over to ICE, sparking national attention and calls for her release. The incident has renewed scrutiny of local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE under 287(g) contracts and a recent Georgia law mandating such agreements. After spending over two weeks in detention, Arias-Cristobal was released on bond, and her attorney is working to secure her permanent residency.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, is complicating Israel's military strategy in the region. Previously, Israel had launched numerous attacks on Syria to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands and to deter anti-Israel groups. However, following Trump's meeting with al-Shara and his announcement of plans to lift sanctions, Israeli strikes on Syria have significantly decreased. This shift in American foreign policy is forcing Israel to reassess its approach to Syria, potentially leading to de-escalation and dialogue.</p>

          <p>Several Republican senators are expressing opposition to a sweeping tax bill backed by President Trump, warning that it could significantly increase the national debt. Senator Ron Johnson stated that there are enough GOP senators ready to block the bill, which passed in the House by a narrow margin. The senators are concerned about the bill's estimated $3.3 trillion addition to the deficit over the next 10 years and are calling for measures to reduce government spending. The article underscores the divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Scottish councils have issued over £25 million in parking fines while seemingly overlooking littering and dog fouling offenses, according to recent figures. The data reveals a stark contrast in enforcement, with significantly fewer fines issued for environmental offenses compared to parking violations. Critics argue that councils are prioritizing revenue generation from motorists over addressing community pollution issues. The article raises questions about local authorities' priorities and their approach to tackling environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Dr. Timothy Johnson, a long-time medical journalist, is criticizing the Trump administration's recent budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), stating that it will cause terrible damage to many outstanding research programs and destroy the careers of many young medical scientists. He believes that many of these defunded researchers will find positions in other welcoming countries, causing a "brain drain" in reverse. He argues that the choice is between smart decisions or reckless destruction that may affect our nation's health for generations to come.</p>
