          <p>A lawmaker has stated that a no-confidence motion against the Ishiba Cabinet will not be pursued. This announcement provides a degree of political stability for the current administration in Japan. The decision averts potential disruption and uncertainty that a no-confidence vote could have triggered, allowing the government to focus on its existing policy agenda and address pressing national issues. This development suggests a level of consensus or lack of sufficient support within the parliament to challenge the current leadership. The political landscape remains stable for the time being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in shipping insurance costs in the Middle East. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's recent attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates have also risen for the Red Sea, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The reassessment of shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment and concerns about a broader conflict, though risks are still being placed to enable cargo flow. The instability in the region is impacting global trade and maritime operations.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that forty Israeli Air Force fighter jets targeted "dozens" of military sites in Iran overnight, including an inactive nuclear reactor in the Arak area. The IDF stated that the Arak heavy water reactor was struck after an evacuation order was issued for the surrounding area. The strike aimed to disable the reactor's ability to produce plutonium, preventing its future use in nuclear weapons development. A "nuclear weapons development" site in Natanz and other military production sites were also targeted, with Israel alleging that the Natanz site contained specialized equipment for advancing nuclear weapons development.</p>

          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even at private institutions, is raising concerns about a potential exodus from public schools. Educators and policy experts warn that this move, intended to ease household financial burdens, could exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support for struggling public schools, which face declining enrollment and budget shortfalls. While public schools have adapted to social changes, they grapple with challenges like teacher workloads and individualized responses to issues such as bullying. The policy's impact is already being observed in areas with existing free high school programs.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit by the Juventus football team, Donald Trump initiated a discussion about transgender women in sports. Trump, who signed an executive order banning transgender participants from women's sports, asked the players for their views on the subject. When the players remained silent, Juventus's general manager, Damien Comolli, mentioned their women's team, but Trump insisted they should play with women. The incident occurred amid increasing hostility toward trans people in the US, coinciding with a Supreme Court ruling upholding a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. The team was in the US for the Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and shut down a nearly 3,000-foot-long drug smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April while under construction, ran beneath the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and was intended to exit near a commercial warehouse in San Diego. The "highly sophisticated" passageway included lighting, ventilation, and a track system for transporting contraband. The entrance was found inside a house in Tijuana, and authorities plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use. This discovery highlights ongoing efforts to combat drug smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully achieved controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium in a compact device. This breakthrough in neutron generation technology has implications for scientific, industrial, and defense applications. The portable particle gun uses an electromagnetic technique to generate a nail-sized beam with 10 billion fast neutrons per second. Each neutron packs 3 million electron volts of energy, similar to particles emitted during an atomic bomb explosion. Neutrons are neutral particles that can slip through materials, acting as an "atomic flashlight."</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously believed. Computer simulations indicate that these stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. The gravitational tug could destabilize objects like Pluto and increase the risk of collision or ejection for planets like Mars and Earth. While the odds are low, researchers note that the risk of collision with Earth is higher than previous estimates.

Consular officers will be looking for posts and messages deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or founding principles. Refusal to comply may result in visa rejection. The State Department also told consulates to prioritize students enrolling at colleges with fewer foreign students. This move aims to ensure thorough screening of individuals seeking to study in the U.S., raising concerns about ideological vetting and freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals made with China. The deals cover infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters stated that funding relies on a high trust bilateral relationship. The Cook Islands responded that it values New Zealand's assistance and is committed to addressing the issue. The move comes as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visits China. These deals are part of China's broader campaign to engage with strategic Pacific nations.</p>

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made an impressive return from Tommy John surgery, pitching four innings in the Dodgers' 4-3 win over the Padres. Sheehan, who missed all of last season, struck out six batters and allowed only one run. Manager Dave Roberts praised Sheehan's ability to attack the strike zone and trust his stuff. Will Smith hit a walk-off home run in the ninth inning to secure the victory. Sheehan's return provides a needed option for the Dodgers' shorthanded rotation, boosting optimism for the team's future.</p>

          <p>The possibility of regime change in Iran is being discussed, but history shows it is a complex undertaking with uncertain outcomes. While the current regime is repressive and exports authoritarianism, overthrowing it may not lead to lasting happiness. The article cautions against naivety, citing the failures of past interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. A defeated Iran could lead to civic instability and a weakened but still revolutionary regime. The author advises caution, emphasizing that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change.</p>
