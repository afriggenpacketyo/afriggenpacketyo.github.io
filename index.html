          <p>Top Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss trade matters, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. Bessent indicated that initial discussions would focus on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal, emphasizing the shared interests between the U.S. and China, given the unsustainable nature of the high tariffs imposed by both countries. China has expressed openness to negotiations but insists on the removal of tariffs before talks begin, while the U.S. remains firm on using tariffs as leverage. The meetings signify a crucial step toward resolving the trade dispute that has caused market turbulence and concerns over economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during his meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite previously criticizing Canada and joking about annexing it as the 51st state. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, surprising many given his recent rhetoric. Carney, however, firmly rejected the idea of Canada becoming part of the U.S., asserting that Canada is not for sale. The meeting covered a range of topics, including trade relations, with Trump stating that tariffs on Canadian goods would remain in place, leading to continued discussions on trade and other complex issues between the two nations. The meeting aimed to foster a friendly relationship despite existing tensions.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs, which have increased import duties and tariffs to 181.47% on delayed shipments. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone during a one-month period. The tariffs have made it financially unviable to continue importing from China, leading to the cancellation of new orders. While the company had already shifted some business to other countries facing tariffs, manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. is not currently a cost-effective alternative.</p>

          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan in response to a recent terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, escalating the conflict between the two nuclear powers. The Indian government stated that its forces targeted nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, focusing on terror camps. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed to respond, raising concerns about further escalation. President Trump described the situation as a shame and expressed hope for a quick resolution, while global leaders called for restraint and de-escalation to avoid dire consequences.

          <p>A plant in Shanxi, China, is being upgraded with French technology to produce aluminum from China's low-grade ore, potentially reducing the country's reliance on imported bauxite. China, a top aluminum producer and consumer, has depended on imports from Guinea and Australia due to its lack of high-quality bauxite. The new technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, enabling the use of high-silica bauxite in the Bayer process. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology, aligning with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry.</p>

The family alleges the officer was speeding and not responding to an emergency when Lavalle was hit, and that Downey failed to notify the family or issue a news release.</p>
