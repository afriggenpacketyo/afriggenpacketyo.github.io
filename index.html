          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that the term 'Common Era' (CE) is a politically motivated replacement for 'Anno Domini' (AD), aiming to diminish the influence of Christianity in historical narratives.  The author presents a biased perspective, framing the use of CE as an act of leftist power and a deliberate erasure of Christian heritage.  The article lacks nuance and fails to consider alternative interpretations of the shift in terminology.</p>
