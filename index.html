          <p>In the lead-up to Russia's Victory Day celebrations, both Russian and Ukrainian forces engaged in continued attacks, escalating tensions. A Russian strike on Kyiv resulted in two fatalities and injuries to eight others, including children. These attacks occurred just before a proposed three-day cease-fire by Russia, intended to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. President Zelensky of Ukraine dismissed the cease-fire offer as insufficient for meaningful negotiations, suggesting it was merely a ploy to ease concerns for guests attending the Victory Day parade in Moscow. The New York Times article details the back-and-forth attacks, including a Ukrainian drone strike on Moscow, and reports of damage and casualties in both Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia.</p>

          <p>Following India's missile strikes into Pakistani-controlled territory, which resulted in at least 26 deaths, including a child, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the actions as an act of war and pledged retaliation.

The heightened tensions have prompted international concern, with the UN Secretary-General urging maximum restraint. The New York Times article describes a decades-long conflict, and mentions that India's army named the operation "Sindoor," referring to women whose husbands were killed in the recent Kashmir massacre.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, stating that the strikes were part of a commitment to hold those responsible for the April 22 attack "accountable". Pakistan, however, has described the strikes as "unprovoked". According to this BBC article, Pakistan's military claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone, while India says at least seven civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes that criminals who refuse to attend sentencing could face up to two additional years in prison. The legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions, providing victims' families with a sense of recognition and reparation. The bill, known as the Victims and Courts Bill, would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court due to disruptive behavior. This BBC article mentions that powers already exist to compel people to attend court, but are often not used due to the risks of restraining disruptive individuals.</p>
