        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the government's intention to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, citing the group's history of criminal damage and increasing frequency and severity of activity since 2024. The move effectively brands the group a terrorist organization, making membership and support illegal, though it does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning about the Middle East. Palestine Action, a "direct action movement," targets firms, charities, universities, and government buildings supporting Israel's military campaign, claiming responsibility for millions of pounds in damages, while stating they are teachers, nurses, students, and parents who disrupt private companies arming Israel's genocide. Cooper will present the draft order to Parliament next week. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have offered differing assessments of the damage inflicted. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth initially claimed Iran's nuclear ambitions were "obliterated," while Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine stated that assessing the damage would take time. An Israeli official indicated the operation aimed to degrade, not destroy, Iran's nuclear program, while a European ballistics expert expressed skepticism about the extent of damage to the underground Fordo facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) awaits access to the sites to ascertain the true extent of the damage, with concerns raised that the attacks could estrange Iran from international legal frameworks and norms.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is demanding that President Trump and his administration "justify" the U.S. military's recent strikes in Iran, stating that he has seen no evidence that the offensive strike was justified under the War Powers Act or the Constitution. Jeffries has requested a briefing for the Gang of Eight and insists that the administration present its case to Congress. While some Democrats have called for Trump's impeachment over the operation, Jeffries sidestepped these questions, focusing on the need for the administration to justify its actions before Congress. The White House claims it made bipartisan calls to congressional leadership, but Jeffries could not be reached before the strike.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of further escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil fell over 7% to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also shed over 7% to settle at $71.48. Investors are hopeful that the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions over the weekend, with some believing he has successfully escalated to de-escalate the situation.</p>

Regenerative medicine doctor Jesse Morse noted that Haliburton's high-grade calf strain in Game 5 was a precursor to the Achilles injury. The Achilles tendon connects muscles from the calf to the heel bone, and a sudden explosive movement can cause it to tear. The Thunder prevailed, 103-91.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office projected that about 11 million people would lose health-care coverage due to provisions in the bill passed by the House of Representatives if it's enacted in its current form.
