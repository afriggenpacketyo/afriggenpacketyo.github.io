          <p>SoftBank's Vision Fund business reported a loss for the fiscal year ending in March, attributing it to slower gains in its tech investment arm. The company saw a 40% decrease in investment gains compared to the previous year, with overall pretax losses reaching 115.02 billion yen. While investments in companies like Didi and Coupang yielded gains, the performance was negatively impacted by the decreased value of companies such as AutoStore. SoftBank is focusing on artificial intelligence, investing heavily in OpenAI and participating in the Stargate joint venture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," a faction within the "Reichsbürger" movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state."

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives to support its claims.

While some cities have implemented free public transport with mixed results, psychological factors such as the desire for safety, comfort, and status associated with car ownership pose challenges. Cities like Jakarta are improving bus services and integrating them with minibuses to encourage public transport use. Other strategies include discouraging car ownership through levies and redesigning cities to prioritize public transport, as seen in Paris, which removes parking lots and increases parking fees for polluting vehicles.</p>
