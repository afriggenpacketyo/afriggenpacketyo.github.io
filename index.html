            <h2>Democrats Allege Trump's Tariffs Invite Corruption</h2>

            <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Senators Warren and Sanders, have voiced concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could lead to corruption and self-dealing within the administration. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Greer, they requested details on measures to prevent misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. The Democrats, limited in their ability to compel replies, aim to scrutinize Trump's economic strategies as part of their opposition to his second term. The letter highlights their focus on the potential for undue influence within the administration's trade agenda.</p>

            <p>French luxury group Hermès will raise prices in the U.S. starting in May to offset the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The price increase will apply only to the U.S. market and aims to fully offset the 10% tariff imposed by the White House. This decision comes as Hermès reports 11% sales growth in the Americas and a slight slowdown in overall revenue growth. U.S. consumers can expect to see higher prices on various goods as a result of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>China plans to host an informal United Nations session to denounce US tariffs as part of its effort to counter Washington's "bullying." The meeting aims to gather international support for multilateralism and opposition to US protectionism. China accuses the US of violating international trade rules and causing economic turbulence through its aggressive use of tariffs. The event comes as the US is attempting to isolate China economically during a 90-day pause on tariffs for most other countries.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in North Dakota has permanently blocked federal regulations requiring Catholic employers to accommodate workers seeking abortions and fertility treatments.

            <p>Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings recounted that Jeff Bezos and Amazon attempted to acquire Netflix in its early days for a low eight-figure sum. Hastings and co-founder Marc Randolph declined the offer, believing they were on the brink of something significant. In 2000, they tried to sell Netflix to Blockbuster for $50 million, but were turned down. Today, Netflix is a video streaming giant with a market cap of over $400 billion and millions of subscribers worldwide.</p>

            <p>A new plaque has been installed on the plinth in Bristol where the statue of slave trader Edward Colston once stood, providing a revised historical context. The wording removes any mention of Colston as a "city benefactor" and highlights his prominent role in the enslavement of African people. The original statue was toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020 and is now on permanent display in a museum. The new plaque aims to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of Colston's legacy.</p>
