          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has affirmed that there will be no relaxation of visa rules for Indian workers or students, despite a recent trade deal aimed at boosting economic ties. During a visit to India with a large business delegation, Starmer emphasized that the focus is on business-to-business engagement and investment, not immigration policy changes. The new trade agreement, signed in July, reduces tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky and Indian exports such as textiles, but the government remains committed to its goal of cutting overall immigration levels into the UK.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani attended a vigil by Israelis for Peace after his statement on the two-year anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attacks drew sharp criticism from Israel. In his statement, Mamdani mourned both Israeli victims of the attack and the thousands of Palestinian victims from Israel's subsequent war in Gaza, which he termed a "genocidal war." The Israeli foreign ministry accused him of spreading "Hamas propaganda," highlighting the deep divisions and political sensitivities surrounding the conflict within the NYC mayoral race.</p>

          <p>Amid conflicts with state governors over the deployment of the National Guard, President Trump has renewed threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, a federal law from 1807. This act grants the president the authority to deploy the U.S. military on domestic soil to suppress uprisings, effectively bypassing gubernatorial control over National Guard troops. Historically used in rare circumstances like the civil rights movement and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, its potential use today raises significant concerns among civil rights groups about the militarization of civilian law enforcement and the erosion of democratic principles.</p>

          <p>On the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas terror attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a statement declaring that Israel's enemies "have not broken us." He described the ongoing conflict as a "fateful war for our existence" and reiterated his commitment to the three primary war aims: returning all hostages, eliminating Hamas's control over Gaza, and ensuring the territory never again poses a threat. Netanyahu's remarks come as negotiators meet in Egypt to discuss a peace plan proposed by President Trump to end the war.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary federal data, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border have fallen to their lowest annual level since 1970 during the 2025 fiscal year. U.S. Border Patrol recorded approximately 238,000 apprehensions, a dramatic decrease from the record 2.2 million seen in 2022 under the previous administration. The significant drop is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include sealing the border, ending the asylum system through emergency powers, and conducting large-scale deportation operations. These measures have been praised by the White House but denounced by civil rights groups as inhumane.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge from a Colorado counselor who argues the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors infringes on her free speech rights. The case, Chiles v. Salazar, centers on whether the 2019 law regulates professional conduct or unconstitutionally censors speech by prohibiting therapists from helping young clients change their sexual orientation or gender identity. Colorado maintains the law protects minors from a harmful and ineffective practice, while the counselor claims it turns therapists into "mouthpieces for the government" by favoring certain viewpoints on gender and sexuality over others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles County has launched an investigation into its historic $4 billion sexual assault settlement after a Times report revealed that some plaintiffs were allegedly paid by recruiters to file fraudulent claims. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a motion to probe possible misconduct by legal representatives and will establish a public tip hotline. The settlement, intended for victims of childhood sexual assault in county facilities, forced significant budget cuts across departments, and supervisors expressed outrage that the system may have been exploited, diverting taxpayer funds intended for genuine survivors.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has detailed a new investment deal with OpenAI, describing it as the company's first "direct partnership" with the AI research lab. Under the agreement, OpenAI will purchase up to $100 billion in hardware directly from Nvidia to build its own AI data center capacity, a shift from the typical model where cloud providers buy the chips and rent out capacity. This strategic move aims to set up OpenAI with its own powerful infrastructure for the long term, solidifying the relationship between two of the most influential companies in the AI boom.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the United States is facing a potential civil-military crisis as President Trump increasingly attempts to politicize the armed forces and use them for domestic purposes. The author contends that while the intelligence and justice systems have been compromised by loyalists, the military remains the last institution not fully under the president's partisan control. With actions like deploying troops to U.S. cities and issuing legally questionable orders, a confrontation looms where military leaders may have to choose between obeying the commander in chief and upholding their oath to the Constitution.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is refusing to swear in newly elected Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva until the government shutdown ends, despite previously stating he would do so "as soon as she wants." A leadership aide confirmed the move, linking her swearing-in to the Senate passing a funding bill, a reversal that denies a duly elected member her seat. This tactic is being criticized as an "outrageous" power play, especially since Johnson swore in two Republican members during a similar pro forma session earlier in the year, suggesting the delay is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Conor McGregor has been suspended for 18 months after violating the organization's anti-doping policy by missing three attempted drug tests within a 12-month period in 2024. The sanction, announced by Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD), was backdated to September 2024 and will run through March 2026. CSAD noted that McGregor was recovering from an injury and cooperated with the inquiry, leading to a reduced penalty from the standard 24 months.

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown might not receive retroactive pay once it ends, a position some lawmakers are calling illegal. An Office of Management and Budget memo suggests a 2019 law guaranteeing back pay does not apply to non-essential employees sent home, a claim disputed by top Democrats. President Trump stated that back pay "depends on who we're talking about," intensifying the financial uncertainty for approximately 750,000 workers currently without pay as the shutdown continues with no resolution in sight.</p>

The most significant drop in approval has occurred among young and Hispanic voters, two groups where he made substantial gains. Despite this slippage, his overall approval rating has remained relatively stable, with an overwhelming majority of Republicans still backing him.
