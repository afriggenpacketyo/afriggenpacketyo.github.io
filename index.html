          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to "embrace change" as the Home Office and Treasury discuss the upcoming Spending Review. Kyle stated that all sectors of society are facing financial pressures and that the review aims to increase spending for schools and scientific research. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns over potential cuts to police numbers and urged the government to protect their budget. The government has already provided an additional £1 billion to the police, and expects them to modernize and use technology to improve services. The police chiefs, including Sir Mark Rowley, have warned that years of cuts have left them with outdated technology.

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's spending bill, arguing that it does not go far enough in cutting government waste. Johnson insists on returning spending to pre-pandemic levels, a reduction significantly deeper than what House Republicans have proposed. He believes that even pressure from the president will not sway him, and he is prepared to vote against the bill unless he sees substantial changes. Johnson emphasizes the need for lawmakers to understand the country's grim fiscal situation and advocates for line-by-line cuts. The article does not contain investment advice.</p>

          <p>President Trump bypassed California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County in response to immigration protests. The move follows clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators, including incidents of violence and property damage. The deployment is authorized under Title 10, which allows the president to use the military for law enforcement in specific cases. This decision has sparked controversy, with some officials criticizing it as inflammatory and an overreach of federal power.

          <p>A U.S. deputy marshal was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Arizona after being misidentified as a suspect. The incident occurred at a federal building in Tucson, and the deputy marshal's identity was quickly confirmed by other law enforcement officers, leading to his release. ICE agents are reportedly under pressure to increase arrests, following a meeting where senior officials were told to make 3,000 arrests per day. The administration appears to be shifting away from targeting suspected gang members and criminals to a more generalized detention of undocumented immigrants.

The remains were found during renovation work in the park, and archaeologists are assisting in the excavation. The bodies were jumbled, with torsos and heads separated, unlike a previous discovery of 33 bodies found earlier this year.

          <p>Psychologist Mark Travers identifies common conflict drivers in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, which is a predictor of divorce, while family arguments often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor is another common issue, with one partner often carrying the "invisible load." Communication styles can also derail conversations, with defensiveness, criticism, and stonewalling exacerbating conflicts.

The article argues that intelligence is not synonymous with moral goodness and that the focus on individual genius obscures the contributions of many.
