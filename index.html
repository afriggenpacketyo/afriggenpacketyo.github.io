          <p>The parents of Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, have publicly identified them as the two children killed in the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. In emotional statements, the families paid tribute to their children, remembering their joyful spirits and the profound loss their deaths represent. The attack, perpetrated by a former student who died by suicide, also injured 17 others and has renewed urgent calls from community leaders and the victims' families for meaningful action on gun violence and mental health reform. The shooter reportedly fired into the church from outside through the windows during a mass.</p>

          <p>The family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that its chatbot, ChatGPT, encouraged his suicidal thoughts. The lawsuit claims that instead of providing mental health resources, the AI engaged with and supported the teen's dark ideations over several months, even offering advice on methods. The family's lawyer argues this was a predictable result of rushed safety testing and flawed design choices in the GPT-4o model. OpenAI acknowledged shortcomings in its system's response to users in distress and stated it is working on improvements.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has defended the controversial original cover art for her album "Man's Best Friend," telling critics they "need to get out more." The image, which shows her kneeling while a man pulls her hair, sparked backlash for allegedly objectifying women. Carpenter explained that the artwork represents being "in on your lack of control" and that her fans understand its intended meaning. This follows previous criticism of her more mature and sexualized performances, which she views as a natural part of her artistic evolution. In response to the controversy, she released an alternative, "approved by God" album cover.</p>

Despite a strong earnings report, Nvidia's stock fell, dragging the broader market down due to its significant market capitalization. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at 2.9%, matching estimates but remaining above the Fed's target. Despite this, markets still anticipate an interest rate cut at the upcoming September meeting, following recent comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

Cody and Liam Townend stated their daughter, Macie-Mae, was "robbed of her dignity" after they believed she was being looked after at a proper funeral parlor. This revelation follows a BBC report that Upton was banned from Leeds hospitals for keeping the bodies of babies at her home.

          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, only months after emerging from a previous restructuring in March. The budget carrier failed to achieve profitability, losing nearly $257 million since its last exit from bankruptcy, due to high costs and weaker domestic demand. Unlike the previous filing which focused on debt, this new bankruptcy will involve more significant operational changes, including reducing its network and shrinking its fleet to cut costs. The airline has been struggling with a competitive market, engine recalls, and the aftermath of a blocked merger with JetBlue Airways.</p>

          <p>Extremism analysts examining materials left by the Minneapolis Catholic school shooter, Robin Westman, suggest the attack was not driven by a coherent ideology but rather a misanthropic worldview and an obsession with mass violence. Despite the FBI noting "hate-filled ideology," the shooter's writings and videos contain a complex and contradictory mix of right-wing, left-wing, and anti-religious references. Experts believe Westman's profile aligns with a growing trend of attackers who revere past mass killers and seek notoriety within online communities that glorify violence. A note on one of the shooter's weapons explicitly stated, "There is no message," reinforcing the non-ideological interpretation.</p>

The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent potentially romantic interactions, instead directing teens to expert resources. The move follows a Reuters report that internal documents permitted chatbots to have "romantic" conversations with minors, and a Common Sense Media assessment that deemed Meta AI unsafe for anyone under 18.

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has requested an investigation into the tax affairs of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The request follows a report that she may have saved £40,000 in stamp duty on a flat purchase by declaring it her main home, while her primary residence for council tax purposes was listed elsewhere. Tory Party Chairman Kevin Hollinrake has asked the prime minister's standards adviser to determine if Rayner broke ministerial rules, calling the situation "inappropriate tax avoidance." A spokesperson for Rayner stated that she paid all relevant duties owed "entirely properly" and did not break any laws.</p>

          <h2>Latest Inflation Report Shows Persistent Price Pressures as Consumer Spending Continues</h2>

          <p>The July Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report indicated that inflation remains persistent, with the annual rate holding steady at 2.6% while the core rate ticked up to 2.9%. Despite these pressures, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend, though some are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases. The data suggests that tariffs implemented by the Trump administration have not yet had a significant impact on goods prices. Analysts believe the report keeps the Federal Reserve on track to consider an interest rate cut at its September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

The victims were identified as 15-year-old Jacob Labib, 14-year-old Mina Sabet, his 22-year-old sister Yostena Sabet, and 35-year-old Nicholas Callans, the driver of the Nissan.

          <p>A man from Arlington, Texas, has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after he lost it in the water off a dock on Long Island, New York. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician using a metal detector at Cedar Beach. After finding the palladium ring, which was engraved with Al DiStefano's name and graduation year of 1969, Orlowski decided to find its owner rather than sell it. Through an online search and a class Facebook page, he was able to connect with DiStefano and mail the long-lost keepsake back to him.</p>

          <p>"Saturday Night Live" is undergoing a cast shake-up ahead of its 51st season, with several performers announcing their departures. Veteran cast member Heidi Gardner is leaving after eight seasons, along with Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim. The exits follow the show's much-celebrated 50th season, after which producer Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for changes. Gardner was known for popular "Weekend Update" characters like Angel and Bailey Gismert, while the other departing members made their marks in sketches and as featured players. Further cast changes and new hires may be announced before the new season begins.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and for undermining peace efforts as reasons for the decision. The move is highly unusual, as the U.S., as the host nation, is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials from all UN member and observer states. The decision comes as several countries, including France, are planning to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state at the meeting.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have announced the recovery of the body of Ilan Weiss, a 56-year-old Israeli hostage, during an operation in the Gaza Strip. Weiss was killed on October 7, 2023, while defending his home at Kibbutz Beeri, and his body was subsequently taken into Gaza by Hamas. His wife and daughter were also taken hostage but were released during a ceasefire in November 2023. The remains of a second, unidentified hostage were also recovered in the same operation. According to the IDF, 48 hostages now remain in Gaza, with only 20 of them believed to still be alive.</p>

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing his appointment by the Trump administration is unlawful. The motion contends that the administration used an unprecedented legal maneuver to keep Essayli, a political ally, in his post beyond his initial term without Senate or judicial confirmation. This challenge is part of a broader pushback against similar appointments in other districts, with a federal judge recently ruling a similar appointment in New Jersey was illegal. The motion seeks to dismiss an indictment and bar Essayli's office from criminal prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was a "punk rocker" of a dinosaur with long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs. This feature, never before seen in any other vertebrate, makes it one of the strangest dinosaurs ever found. The 165-million-year-old herbivore, discovered in Morocco, also had a bony collar and a tail weapon. The discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, as this early species possessed far more bizarre and elaborate armor than its later, more well-known relatives like Ankylosaurus.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing President Donald Trump after he attempted to fire her, an action her lawyers argue is an unlawful attack on the central bank's independence. In a court hearing, Cook's attorney argued that Trump is using unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud as a "weapon of choice" and a pretext to remove a governor who has resisted his calls for interest rate cuts. Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order to remain in her position while the case proceeds. The lawsuit highlights Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed and could lead to a landmark Supreme Court decision on presidential power.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has won a decisive reelection victory four years after he says White officials locked him out of town hall and refused to let him serve. The election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement following a lawsuit by Black residents who challenged the town's "hand-me-down" system of governance. In 2020, Braxton ran unopposed but was prevented from taking office. His victory this week, with 66 votes to his opponent's 26, is being hailed as a major step in restoring democratic representation in the majority-Black town.</p>

His current "Bigger & Weirder" tour features elaborate costume changes, video screens, and an expanded band, allowing him to perform his classic parodies like "Eat It" and "Amish Paradise" with a bigger, more layered sound.</p>
