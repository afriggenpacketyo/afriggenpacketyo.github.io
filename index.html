        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has cautioned that President Trump's newly announced tariffs are likely to drive up prices for both domestic and imported goods, consequently slowing down the already weakening U.S. economy. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon highlighted the potential short-term inflationary effects of the tariffs and the uncertainties they create for global capital flows and corporate profits. He emphasized that a swift resolution to the tariff issue is crucial to prevent cumulative negative effects on the economy. Dimon's comments mark the first public address by a major Wall Street bank CEO regarding Trump's tariff policy.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields have fallen sharply as President Trump's tariffs spur a flight to safety amidst concerns about a global trade war. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped to its lowest level since September 2022, reflecting investor anxiety over the economic impact of the tariffs. Investors are increasing their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, anticipating at least five cuts in 2025. However, analysts suggest that the Fed's ability to intervene may be limited unless financial markets begin to seize up.

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, driven by concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. OPEC+ producers' decision to increase production has also contributed to the downward pressure on prices. Goldman Sachs has lowered its oil price forecast for December 2025, anticipating further price declines in 2026. The market is worried that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which could slow down economic activity and hurt oil demand.

          <p>British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has announced a temporary suspension of U.S. shipments as it assesses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on vehicle imports. The U.S. president has implemented a 25% tariff on all foreign cars imported into the country, a move that came into effect on Thursday. An escalating trade war is expected to significantly disrupt the global car industry, given the complex and globalized nature of supply chains. In response to the tariffs, other car giants have already announced plans to raise prices, impose import fees, pause production, and lay off staff.</p>

The number of measles cases in the U.S. has more than doubled compared to last year, with infections confirmed in 21 states. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine's safety.

          <p>Amy Griffin's memoir, "The Tell," explores the recovery of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse through psychedelic MDMA therapy, raising complex questions about the validity of such memories and the use of unconventional treatments. While the book has garnered significant attention and praise, it has also sparked debate due to the controversial nature of repressed memories and the lack of federal approval for MDMA therapy. Experts emphasize that while MDMA therapy can help patients process difficult memories, it is not intended to recover them. The science on recovering events from the past is less certain, as scientific research has shown that people who experience traumatic events are more likely to remember them with full accuracy, not less.</p>

          <p>Palestinian detainees released from Israeli custody have reported being subjected to mistreatment and torture by Israeli military and prison staff, including chemical burns, assaults, and electric shocks. The IDF stated that it "completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees" but said some cases would be "examined." The IPS stated it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse. International law requires humane treatment of all detainees, regardless of alleged wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that AI bots, with proper training, can provide mental health therapy as effectively as human clinicians. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows results from the first randomized clinical trial for AI therapy. Researchers from Dartmouth College developed the bot to address the shortage of mental health providers. Patients reported forming strong bonds and trust with their AI therapists, and found the lack of time constraints advantageous.</p>

Rangers at Fort de Soto county park have seen the population increase significantly. The tortoises are also benefiting other animals in the ecosystem, as they share their burrows with other species. The tortoises have adapted to their new habitat, with some burrowing deep into higher elevations.</p>

          <p>Border businesses near Canada are already struggling due to the increased tariffs. This dairy farmer in Potsdam, New York, is already experiencing difficulties.

He has to eat the cost of the tariffs. The tariffs are capricious, haphazard, and weird, and that is why they will have real effects.</p>

          <p>Philosopher Jaron Lanier argues that the way we talk about AI is misleading and that the focus should be on AI as a tool for collaboration, not as an independent intelligence. He suggests that treating AI as a new entity or god-like figure hinders our ability to improve it and address potential problems. Lanier also expresses concerns about the potential for AI to exacerbate existing issues with social media, such as the reduction of individuals to crude avatars and the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>Democrats are focusing on Virginia elections as a referendum on Elon Musk's actions. The party aims to capitalize on a backlash against Musk's "department of government efficiency" (DOGE) and President Trump's policies. Democrats plan to invest in key races, emphasizing issues such as housing, healthcare, and wages. The election is expected to test the popularity of Republican policies and the impact of Musk's influence in the state.</p>

          <p>The super-wealthy Americans will enjoy tax breaks and deregulation for their businesses, while the poor will face rising prices, shrinking services, and reduced opportunity. But America’s tech oligarchs may discover sooner rather than later that, by undermining democratic governance, they are empowering an authoritarian president who can pick them off one by one—just as Putin did with the oligarchs who helped cement his rule. When extreme wealth combines forces with extreme power, the former can profit enormously for a time. As in Russia, the benefits of the executive’s policies are likely to flow upward</p>

Editors at university newspapers report increased anxiety among writers since the arrest of a Tufts University graduate student. Some students fear legal repercussions, online harassment, and professional consequences for expressing their views. A coalition of national student journalism organizations has called on student papers to reconsider editorial norms around unpublishing stories and anonymization.</p>

          <p>President Trump's anti-union actions are encouraging some U.S. employers to adopt a more hostile stance toward unions, potentially slowing their recent progress. Trump's administration has taken actions such as ending collective bargaining for airport screeners and federal employees. A Michigan company refused to move forward with a union election, citing the paralysis of the NLRB after a controversial firing. Experts suggest that these actions may embolden companies to become more anti-union, following the example set by Trump and Elon Musk.</p>
