          <p>President Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, marking the first time since 1965 that a president has activated a state's National Guard without the governor's request. The move has drawn criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called it inflammatory and unnecessary, while President Trump defended the deployment as necessary to address lawlessness. Protests erupted following ICE operations in Los Angeles, with clashes occurring between demonstrators and authorities, prompting the federal government to take action to maintain order and enforce immigration laws. The situation highlights the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and California over immigration policy. Optimism that the situation will de-escalate remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India briefly considered transitioning to a presidential system, according to historian Srinath Raghavan. Key figures in Gandhi's government advocated for centralizing power and sidelining the judiciary, drawing inspiration from Charles de Gaulle's France. The idea involved a directly elected president with expanded authority, a curtailed judiciary, and a reined-in press. Although the presidential system never fully materialized, the Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 reflected its influence by expanding Parliament's powers and limiting judicial review. This article explores a significant but often overlooked chapter in India's political history. </p>
