          <h2>Deportation of Chinese Scientist in 1950s Had Profound Geopolitical Consequences</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times reflects on the deportation of Qian Xuesen, a Chinese rocket scientist, from the U.S. in 1955 and its impact on global power dynamics. The author argues that this decision, driven by xenophobia during the McCarthy era, inadvertently aided China's development of its missile and space programs. Qian's return to China allowed the nation to rapidly advance its technological capabilities, ultimately challenging American dominance in Asia. The article suggests that the current administration's targeting of foreign students and researchers echoes this historical misstep, cautioning against repeating past mistakes that could alter the global balance of power.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, accusing him of being a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This attack came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled against Trump's tariffs. Trump suggested the ruling was influenced by Leo and the Federalist Society, an organization that previously advised him on judicial picks. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for his involvement in transforming the federal courts during Trump's presidency. This marks a significant departure from Trump's previous positive remarks about Leo and the Federalist Society, highlighting potential divisions within the conservative legal movement.</p>

          <p>Shein, the fast-fashion giant, is reportedly shifting its IPO plans from London to Hong Kong due to regulatory hurdles and ongoing scrutiny. The company faces allegations of forced labor and consumer protection violations, including misleading sustainability claims and fake discounts. An EU investigation found Shein in breach of consumer protection laws, adding to the challenges. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods further complicates Shein's ambitions.

          <p>The U.S. decision to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with ties to the Communist Party is facing backlash from both within the United States and from Beijing. The Chinese embassy in Washington lodged a formal diplomatic protest, calling the move discriminatory and politically motivated. Critics argue that the policy is xenophobic and undermines academic exchange. The State Department defends the decision as necessary to protect U.S. national security and prevent the exploitation of universities and theft of research.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new area of conflict in the rivalry between China and the United States. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains low, the US could gradually expand targeted sanctions against Chinese entities. The economist notes that implementing broad sanctions, such as cutting China off from the SWIFT system, would be difficult due to China's significant role in global trade. Such actions could also undermine the SWIFT system by encouraging the use of alternative payment systems like CIPS.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's four-month tenure in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been marked by significant changes and controversies. Musk aimed to cut government spending, claiming to have saved $175 billion through various measures, including workforce reductions and program eliminations. His presence in the White House, as an unelected official with extensive business interests, raised ethical concerns. Musk's actions also led to a shift in US foreign policy, with significant cuts to international aid programs and the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <h2>US-China Trade Talks Stall, Leaders' Intervention Needed</h2>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that U.S.-China trade talks "are a bit stalled" and require direct intervention from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite reaching a breakthrough agreement in May, tensions remain over tech restrictions and rare earth policies. Bessent believes that the magnitude and complexity of the talks necessitate the leaders' involvement. Trump and Xi last spoke in January, and analysts suggest China will only agree to another call if there is assurance of no surprises from the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Allows Trump Tariffs to Remain in Place</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 21:41:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An appeals court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs can remain in place for now, temporarily suspending a lower court's decision that deemed them illegal. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's ruling threatened to unravel trade negotiations and improperly second-guessed the president. The appeals court decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated. The legal battle is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court, with potential implications for Trump's trade agenda.</p>
