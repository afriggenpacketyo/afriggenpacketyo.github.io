            <p>The UK's leading business organizations, including the British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry, have jointly urged the government to revise its Employment Rights Bill. They argue that the bill, intended to enhance worker rights, could hinder economic growth by discouraging hiring and increasing administrative costs. The bill proposes guaranteed hours and stricter regulations on zero-hour contracts, aiming to provide greater job security and benefits from day one of employment. A government spokesperson defended the bill as a significant upgrade to worker rights, citing extensive consultations with businesses, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has expressed concerns about its potential negative impact on the economy.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a complete power outage, leaving all 1.4 million clients without electricity as the island prepared for Easter weekend. The outage was attributed to a failure in a transmission line and vegetation interference, with Luma Energy estimating that restoring power could take 48-72 hours. Hospitals are operating on generators, and thousands of residents are without water. The blackout has sparked public anger, with many calling for the government to terminate contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR, highlighting the island's ongoing struggles with its power grid since Hurricane Maria in 2017.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced new studies aimed at identifying environmental factors contributing to the rising rates of autism diagnoses, following a report indicating that 1 in 31 children are now diagnosed with autism. Kennedy challenged the notion that increased awareness and broadening diagnostic criteria fully account for the rise, emphasizing the need to investigate potential environmental exposures such as mold, food, and pesticides. While experts agree that environmental factors could play a role, they also acknowledge the impact of the expanding definition of autism and genetic predispositions. Kennedy pledged to follow the science regardless of his current expectations, though he stated that he believes the cause to be environmental.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration. Despite the government's admission of an "administrative error," they have also alleged that Ábrego García has ties to the MS-13 gang, which his lawyers deny. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has stated he does not have the power to return Ábrego García. The judge is requesting daily updates from the government on their efforts to bring him back to the US, as Ábrego García has not been charged with gang activities.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that while fewer Americans are attending church services or identifying with a religion, many still maintain their faith and spirituality through personal practices like prayer and meditation. The research, tracking teenagers into adulthood, found a significant drop in weekly church attendance and religious affiliation, but a less drastic decline in belief in God. Political conflicts, particularly on issues like same-sex marriage, were cited as a major reason for leaving organized religion. The study suggests a shift towards individualized spirituality rather than a decline in faith itself.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" for the central bank by accelerating inflation while slowing economic growth. He noted that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and are likely to result in higher prices for consumers. Powell indicated that the Federal Reserve can remain patient and assess the impact of the tariffs before making any changes to interest rates. However, some splits have emerged among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee regarding the appropriate response to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An investigation reveals how weapons from the US are smuggled into Haiti, fueling gang violence that has plunged the country into chaos. The BBC traced the journey of two boxes containing assault rifles and pistols from Florida to Haiti, highlighting lax laws, absent checks, and suspected corruption that allow traffickers to bypass a UN embargo. The report details how weapons are often purchased through "straw buyers" and shipped in small quantities to avoid detection. The power of the gangs has led to widespread violence, displacement, and hunger in Haiti.</p>

Initiatives like the "silver train" are designed to provide older travelers with opportunities to visit remote parts of the country and stimulate local economies. The government hopes that increased spending by retirees can help offset lost export revenue and make Chinese companies less reliant on overseas trade. These trains make it possible, with easy access to boarding and alighting, and with staff to help as well as extra medical support if required.</p>
