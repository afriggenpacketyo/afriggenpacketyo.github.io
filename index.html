          <p>France's government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, was ousted after losing a confidence vote concerning the 2026 budget. The proposed budget aimed to implement €44 billion in cuts to reduce the nation's significant deficit, but failed to gain support from political rivals. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, facing options like forming a new government or calling another snap election, all while navigating strong opposition from both the far-right and far-left. The political instability raises concerns about France's fiscal consolidation ahead of a Fitch Ratings review.</p>

          <p>Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned on Tuesday following two days of violent protests that resulted in the deaths of at least 19 people. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on major social media platforms, but it quickly evolved into a broader movement against government corruption and a lack of opportunities for the nation's youth. Despite the government repealing the social media ban, protests continued, with demonstrators targeting the properties of several politicians. The crisis highlights deep-seated public anger over governance and economic stagnation in the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is expected to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno was sacked after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having led the club to its highest Premier League finish in decades last season and securing European qualification. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham Hotspur after a difficult league campaign, is seen as a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. If appointed, he would become the eighth permanent manager under the club's current ownership since 2017.</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated and ranked in new league tables based on performance across seven key areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management. Specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital secured the top positions, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn was ranked at the bottom, partly due to structural issues with its buildings. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to increase transparency and accountability. However, some organizations have raised concerns that the metrics used may not accurately reflect the quality of patient care.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued a comprehensive evacuation order for all residents of Gaza City, warning that it intends to operate "with great force" in the area. The directive urges civilians to move south towards Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone, ahead of a planned seizure of the city as part of Israel's stated goal to eliminate Hamas. Many residents remain in the city, citing the inability to afford transport, a lack of space in safe zones, or general uncertainty about their safety even after evacuating.

Shortly after, the parade in the city's Pilsen neighborhood coincidentally began with four men on horseback.

Previously, these plans, which feature lower premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs, were restricted to individuals under 30 or those granted a rare hardship exemption. The administration has now expanded eligibility for this exemption, a move the author claims will save families thousands and encourage uninsured individuals, particularly younger and healthier ones, to get coverage, thereby stabilizing the insurance market.

The Mona M03, which debuted in China with a starting price under $17,000, represents a strategic push into the mass market that will intensify competition with established automakers. Xpeng's CEO, He Xiaopeng, noted that the company's international expansion is proceeding faster than anticipated and also signaled that the company is now open to acquiring other carmakers.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has obtained and released documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" compiled for the financier's 50th birthday. The book, reportedly organized by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists Donald Trump in the "Friends" section and contains a page with a letter allegedly signed by him, which he has publicly denied writing. The release follows a subpoena issued by the committee and intensifies scrutiny of the former president's past association with Epstein. The White House has disputed the authenticity of the signature shown in the released document.</p>

          <p>China is working to finalize and sign an upgraded free-trade agreement, known as CAFTA 3.0, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) by the end of the year.

This initiative is part of Beijing's strategy to strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner and diversify its exports. The move is seen as an effort to bolster regional trade networks in response to rising global competition and increasing protectionist policies from the United States.</p>

          <p>The past relationship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein has returned to the spotlight amid controversy over the release of files related to the financier's crimes. The two were photographed together in the 1990s and early 2000s, with Trump once calling Epstein a "terrific guy" in a 2002 interview. After Epstein's 2019 arrest, Trump downplayed their connection, stating they had a "falling out" years prior. While flight logs show Trump flew on Epstein's plane multiple times, there is no evidence he visited Epstein's private island or was involved in any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that populist right-wing movements in both the US and the UK are actively trying to rewrite national history to advance their political agendas. The author points to the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of attempts to erase narratives of struggle, particularly those of minority groups. This historical revisionism, the article contends, serves to justify rolling back 20th-century democratic achievements like civil rights legislation and creates a narrative that supports anti-immigrant and anti-worker policies.</p>
