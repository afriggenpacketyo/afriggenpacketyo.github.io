          <p>Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales are merging their satellite and space operations to create a major European space entity, aiming to rival Elon Musk's Starlink. This joint venture will focus on developing a broad range of space technologies and end-to-end solutions, excluding space launchers, and is expected to generate significant annual synergies. The merger aims to consolidate Europe's space industry, enabling it to compete globally and maintain control over domestic space programs, with Airbus holding a majority stake. David Barker from GAM views this as a positive step in re-establishing Europe's space industry as a global force. Optimism for the aerospace and defense sector remains high, with positive ratings for Thales and Leonardo.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks to acquire equity stakes in quantum-computing firms like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum in exchange for federal funding. This move aligns with efforts to bolster industries vital to U.S. national security and compete with China, similar to previous investments in rare earth and semiconductor companies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the government will only consider stakes in strategic industries, and Trump has expressed interest in benefiting from companies' success when federal funds contribute to their growth. Quantum computing is seen as a critical technology with economic and security implications, with experts predicting its potential to revolutionize medicine, finance, and cybersecurity.</p>

          <h2>France Reportedly Retreating from Commitment to Intercept Migrant Boats</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is reportedly backing away from its pledge to increase maritime intervention to prevent small boats from crossing the English Channel, according to sources speaking with the BBC. Political turmoil in France is contributing to the shift, which is a setback for the UK's efforts to address the migrant issue. Despite promises of a new maritime doctrine to intercept and return boats, the French maritime prefecture states the policy is still under consideration. Legal and moral concerns, particularly the risk of fatalities and potential prosecutions of security forces, are major obstacles to stopping the boats at sea.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's leader welcomed new economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU on Russia, calling it an important step to pressure Moscow. The sanctions target Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as the financial sector, with the EU also imposing limits on Russian diplomats' movements. Russia dismissed the sanctions as counterproductive, while former president Dmitry Medvedev labeled them an "act of war." Despite U.S.-led peace efforts, the conflict continues, with Ukrainian forces holding back Russian advances and both sides launching strikes on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has slowed to a 15-year low, increasing by only 1.4% in August compared to the previous year, according to a report by Cotality. The slowdown is attributed to weakening rent growth across all price points, though regional variations exist, with Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., experiencing the highest annual rent growth. Dallas saw a decline in rent growth due to a surge in new multifamily apartments. Multifamily apartment rents are also cooling due to increased construction, with national vacancy rates reaching a record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chess's international governing body is considering disciplinary action against Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for persistently accusing Daniel Naroditsky of cheating. The allegations, made over the past year, have been criticized by several grandmasters. Naroditsky, who denied the accusations, passed away recently, and the federation will establish a prize in his memory. The investigation follows complaints about Kramnik's conduct, including accusations of harassment and spreading baseless allegations.</p>

          <p>Philip Pullman's fantasy series, His Dark Materials, concludes with The Rose Field, exploring themes of imagination and the limitations of reason. The series distinguishes itself from other fantasy works by incorporating real-world elements and challenging traditional notions of innocence and experience. Pullman's writing emphasizes the importance of meaning, feeling, and art in a world increasingly stripped of its value. With a focus on the present and not the next world, the series invites readers to consider the value of the one we have.</p>
