          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed public criticism over the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing for a new ballroom as "manufactured outrage." The project, estimated at $250 million, has drawn condemnation after photos of the construction went viral. In response to security concerns, the Treasury Department has instructed its staff not to share images of the work, citing potential risks of revealing sensitive structural details. President Trump has stated that he and private donors will finance the new addition, which he has championed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Priceless crown jewels recently stolen from the Louvre museum were not privately insured, according to France's Ministry of Culture. French law designates collections in national museums as state property, making the state its own insurer and prohibiting private insurance unless items are loaned out. Consequently, neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the estimated €88 million loss. This policy highlights a unique approach to protecting national treasures, where the financial risk is borne directly by the state rather than external insurers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Schroders found that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before the recommended age of 70, despite understanding that waiting would result in significantly higher monthly payments. Many respondents cited the immediate need for income in retirement and concerns about the program's future financial stability as primary reasons for their decision. Financial experts often advise delaying claims to maximize lifetime benefits, but the survey highlights a major disconnect between this advice and the financial realities many workers face. The trend suggests widespread anxiety about personal savings and the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York man who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot has been arrested and charged with making terroristic threats. The individual, Christopher Moynihan, is accused of threatening to kill House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries issued a statement thanking law enforcement and highlighting that many individuals pardoned for the riot have since committed additional crimes. The incident brings renewed scrutiny to the blanket pardons issued by the administration for those convicted of Jan. 6-related offenses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed administrative claims demanding $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for the criminal investigations he faced after his first term. The claims, which are precursors to potential lawsuits, relate to the Russia election interference probe and the investigation into his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. The situation presents a potential conflict of interest, as any settlement might require approval from officials Trump appointed during his second term. The President himself has publicly acknowledged the awkwardness of effectively suing his own government.</p>

          <p>A high court in Colombia has overturned the witness tampering conviction of former President Álvaro Uribe, who had previously been sentenced to house arrest. The court ruled that the charges of bribery in a criminal proceeding were not proven "beyond a reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evidence evaluation in the initial conviction. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, was accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged connections to their groups. The acquittal marks a significant turn in a politically charged case that has strained relations between Colombia and the United States.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season. Currently located in the Caribbean, the storm is not expected to pose a major threat to the mainland United States, though its long-term track and intensity are still uncertain. A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti, and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica, with both islands facing risks of heavy rainfall and flash flooding. Forecasters are closely monitoring the storm as some models show it could potentially turn west toward the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

          <p>A third survivor of child sexual exploitation has resigned from the advisory panel for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, stating the process feels "scripted and predetermined." The survivor, identified as Elizabeth, expressed concern that their voices were being used to legitimize decisions that had already been made, fueling frustration over the inquiry's direction. The resignations come amid delays in appointing a chairperson and accusations that officials are attempting to widen the inquiry's scope beyond its intended focus on grooming gangs. This has undermined confidence among some survivors that the inquiry can deliver meaningful results.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Leland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book International, the central conflict between the U.S. and China is not about trade tariffs but about control over critical supply chain "choke points." Speaking at a conference, Miller argued that the most important issue is which nation controls the supply of essential products, particularly rare earth elements vital for high-tech manufacturing. He noted that China has already begun to leverage this power by restricting exports in response to trade pressures. This perspective reframes the economic rivalry as a strategic battle for control over the foundational components of modern industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The audacious, daylight robbery of crown jewels from the Louvre museum is evoking memories of the "Pink Panthers," a notorious network of thieves responsible for stealing over $500 million in valuables from the 1990s to the 2010s. While there is no evidence linking the two, the professional and swift nature of the Louvre heist is characteristic of the Pink Panthers' methods, which often involved meticulous planning and rapid execution. The historical context highlights the ongoing challenge law enforcement faces in combating highly organized criminal groups that target high-value cultural and luxury items, which are often difficult to recover once stolen.</p>

The talks will also aim to de-escalate tensions surrounding the Dutch government's effective takeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia due to national security concerns.

Wolfe compared the current enthusiasm to the dot-com era, suggesting that many people will lose money.

Critics fear that a ruling in Trump's favor could grant unchecked authority to use military force against protesters or even to interfere in elections. The case revisits the historical fear of using military power against citizens and tests the legal limits on presidential command of state militias.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a financially sustainable model by primarily serving refugee and immigrant patients on Medicaid. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic uses a walk-in system, in-house pharmacy, and other efficiencies to see a high volume of patients while keeping costs low and staff well-paid. By focusing almost exclusively on Medicaid, the clinic has mastered its billing system and avoids the complexities of private insurance. This unique approach challenges the conventional wisdom that Medicaid is an unprofitable payer and offers a potential model for serving low-income communities effectively.</p>

          <p>The northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv is experiencing a total blackout after a massive Russian assault involving over 100 drones and multiple ballistic missiles targeted its energy infrastructure. The attack is part of Russia's escalating campaign against civilian and energy facilities across Ukraine, which has intensified in recent months. In the wider Chernihiv region, at least four people were killed in strikes on residential areas. The sustained bombardment threatens to deplete Ukraine's energy resilience and replacement equipment ahead of winter, placing immense strain on the civilian population and the economy.</p>

A White House official stated there are "no plans" for a meeting in the "immediate future," citing that a preparatory call between the countries' top diplomats was sufficient. The cancellation appears to stem from significant disagreements over how to end the war in Ukraine, with Russia rejecting a U.S.-backed proposal to freeze the conflict along current front lines.

The suspect was struck in the elbow, while the marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet; neither injury was life-threatening.
