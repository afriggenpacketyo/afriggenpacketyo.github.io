          <h2>Cryptocurrency Market Rallies on Renewed Hope for US Stablecoin Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 13:59:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cryptocurrency prices and related stocks experienced a significant rally following a procedural vote in the U.S. House that advanced key crypto regulation bills. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins and the broader CLARITY Act, had previously been halted, causing a brief market dip. President Trump's subsequent support for the bills helped reverse the downturn, with analysts suggesting their eventual passage is a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' This legislative momentum has renewed optimism in the digital asset sector, boosting major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asked a group of House Republicans whether he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a legally untested action that could destabilize financial markets. Sources indicated that many in the room voiced approval and that Trump suggested he would do it. This development is part of an escalating pressure campaign against Powell, whom Trump has publicly criticized for not cutting interest rates faster. The administration has also accused the Fed of mismanaging a headquarters renovation, an allegation Powell has denied.</p>

          <p>President Trump has labeled the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation a "Hoax" and "bulls***," lashing out at his own supporters who are demanding more transparency. In social media posts, he compared the situation to the Russia investigation and disavowed the "weaklings" in his party for pursuing the issue. The backlash stems from a Justice Department memo that found no "client list," a conclusion that angered many conservatives, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who believe the administration is covering something up.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is working to pass President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal spending, a measure that narrowly advanced after Vice President JD Vance cast two tie-breaking votes. The package targets approximately $8 billion in foreign aid and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The proposal has faced resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about the cuts to foreign assistance programs and local media, leading to amendments that the House will need to approve before a fast-approaching deadline.</p>

          <p>A '48 Hours' report is revisiting the highly unusual 2007 case of Linda Duffey, who fatally shot her husband but claimed it was an accident that happened while she was mimicking a Bugs Bunny cartoon. This strange explanation, dubbed the "Bugs Bunny Defense," was surprisingly taken seriously by at least one investigator, causing a rift among authorities even before the case went to trial. The story serves as a look into one of the most bizarre cases to pass through the justice system.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that President Trump's increasingly evasive and contradictory statements regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation are failing to quell the controversy. By attempting to deflect blame onto political rivals or dismissing the entire affair as "boring stuff," Trump is behaving like a "cornered man." The author suggests that this uncharacteristic response, which differs from his usual approach of relentless attack, only strengthens the perception that he may be hiding damaging information about his relationship with Epstein.</p>

          <p>A massive tax and spending package signed by President Trump will fundamentally alter the federal student loan system by introducing new borrowing limits. Effective in 2026 for new borrowers, the legislation establishes a lifetime cap of $257,500 for all federal loans and imposes stricter annual and lifetime limits on graduate students and parents using the Parent PLUS program. Experts suggest this will reshape higher education financing, potentially curbing tuition inflation but also driving more students toward private loans.</p>
