          <p>The article reports on the results of the Canadian federal election in 2025. Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured enough seats to form a government but failed to achieve a majority in the House of Commons. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh both lost their seats. The Liberals won key provinces like Ontario and Quebec, while the Conservatives dominated in Alberta. The article also highlights the rise in support for both major parties at the expense of smaller parties. Optimism is moderate as a government has been formed, but the lack of a majority suggests potential instability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, prompting a response from the university asserting that there is no legal basis for such an action. Harvard argues that losing its tax-exempt status would severely impact its ability to carry out its educational mission, including providing financial aid and conducting critical research. The university spokesperson also mentioned that the government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to block federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR), alleging biased and partisan news coverage.

PBS called the order unlawful, while CPB said it is not subject to the President's authority. NPR director Katherine Maher estimated that the radio station would receive about $120m from the CPB in 2025, less than 5% of its budget.</p>

          <p>President Trump's increased tariffs on goods from China are expected to impact holiday sales and retail inventories. Small businesses that supply big box retail stores are reviewing product inventories and discount plans based on tariff economics. Business owners and supply chain executives say the next 30 days are critical for trade deals to lift tariffs. Retailers are concerned about inventory and may offer fewer discounts during key shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. One company has already stopped shipments and is considering raising prices by 20-25%.</p>
