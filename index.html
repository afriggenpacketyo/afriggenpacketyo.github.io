          <p>A medical helicopter crashed on eastbound Highway 50 in Sacramento, critically injuring the three crew members aboard, including a pilot, nurse, and paramedic. The REACH helicopter had just departed UC Davis Medical Center, where the nurse, identified as Suzie Smith, is now receiving care for multiple serious injuries. The aircraft was en route to Redding when it experienced an "in-air emergency," according to officials. Remarkably, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the incident, which authorities, including the NTSB and FAA, are now thoroughly investigating to determine the cause of the crash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are expected to open flat on Wednesday, reflecting a challenging week marked by political instability and economic concerns. The shock resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, coupled with the U.K.'s beleaguered steel industry facing potential EU tariff hikes, contributes to the lack of market direction. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures showed little change after the S&P 500's winning streak ended, influenced by a fall in Oracle shares and the ongoing government shutdown. Investors are closely watching German industrial production figures and any developments from French President Macron's efforts to break the political impasse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are joining indirect peace talks between Israeli and Hamas negotiators in Egypt, following a second day of discussions that yielded no tangible results. President Trump expressed optimism about the possibility of Middle East peace, coinciding with the second anniversary of the October 7 attacks. Negotiations focus on a permanent ceasefire, hostage-prisoner exchange, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, humanitarian aid, and post-war governance. Despite the "tough" talks and disagreements over Israeli withdrawal maps and Hamas's guarantees, mediators are actively working to bridge the gaps between the two sides.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surpassed $4,000 an ounce, marking its most significant rally since the 1970s, as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst global economic and political uncertainty. Factors contributing to this surge include US President Donald Trump's tariffs, delays in economic data release due to the US government shutdown, and a weakening US dollar. Analysts from OCBC and UOB banks highlight gold's role as a hedge against uncertainty, though its price could fall if the shutdown ends quickly or interest rates rise. A record $64 billion has been invested in gold ETFs this year, reflecting broad investor concern. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts and former teammates highlight his exceptional reflexes, improved footwork, and long distribution as key strengths. While his animated temperament was once a concern, former England goalkeepers Paul Robinson and Rob Green, along with teammates Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott, note his increased maturity and consistent performances for both club and country.

          <p>France faces heightened scrutiny over its significant budget deficit and debt pile following Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's resignation, the fifth in under two years. The country's fiscal metrics far exceed EU rules, prompting an "excessive deficit procedure" from the European Commission. President Macron has granted Lecornu 48 hours to find a path to stability, but political fragmentation makes achieving fiscal consolidation challenging. Economists from INSEAD and Goldman Sachs predict continued budget slippage and slower growth, raising concerns about potential further credit rating downgrades and the country's ability to meet its EU obligations by 2029.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is navigating a highly fragmented European Parliament, facing two no-confidence votes within three months from both far-right and left-wing groups.

While an ouster is unlikely, the votes highlight fragile trust within the parliament and dwindling cooperation between traditional center alliances. Experts suggest this signals a new normal of constant stress tests for the EU system, requiring von der Leyen to focus on maintaining engagement and unity among centrist parties to advance key legislation.</p>

          <p>VoteVets, a liberal group supporting veteran candidates, is injecting $1 million into aggressive ad campaigns for Democratic gubernatorial nominees in Virginia and New Jersey. The ads feature veterans discussing economic difficulties and criticizing Republican opponents, Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey and Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia, for policies allegedly worsening financial situations. Ciattarelli's campaign refutes tax hike claims, while Earle-Sears faces connections to Trump's economic policies. These closely watched races, often seen as referenda on the sitting president, are heating up with legal threats and controversies, including the alleged release of a Democratic nominee's military records.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to a spectacular supermoon this week, appearing notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit. This particular supermoon is also known as the Hunter's Moon, a name historically associated with the first full moon in October. The traditional name reflects the period when people in the northern hemisphere would hunt and preserve meats in preparation for the upcoming winter months, connecting the astronomical phenomenon with ancient human practices.</p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, endorsed by President Trump, has won a crowded Republican primary for a Tennessee House seat, setting him up against Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps' victory came after a late endorsement from Trump, who praised him as an "America First Patriot" and combat-decorated Army helicopter pilot. The special election is crucial for Republicans to slightly expand their House majority and will serve as a gauge of Trump's second-term agenda's popularity, particularly among suburban voters. Behn, a social worker, focuses on women's reproductive health rights, ensuring a ideologically charged general election.</p>

          <p>Former football star Herschel Walker has been confirmed by the Senate as the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, marking the first such appointment in over a decade. President Trump nominated Walker last year, following his unsuccessful 2022 Senate bid in Georgia. Walker, a Heisman Trophy winner and former NFL player, was previously on the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. His confirmation, alongside over 100 other Trump nominees, occurred via a rules change by Senate Republicans to approve nominees "en bloc" amidst the ongoing government shutdown impasse, a move criticized by Democrats as "going nuclear."</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles is appealing a federal court order that bars LAPD officers from targeting journalists and nonviolent protesters with crowd control weapons. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera issued the injunction after multiple allegations of excessive force during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. City attorneys argue the ban is impractical and risks officers' safety by potentially causing hesitation in chaotic situations, claiming it's difficult to identify journalists. However, civil rights lawyers contend the incidents were deliberate violations of guidelines, not mistakes, highlighting a fundamental disagreement over police conduct during demonstrations.</p>

This partnership includes a $35.6 million investment, aimed at unlocking domestic supplies of copper and other critical minerals in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The company welcomed President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project, reversing a previous administration's rejection. This move is intended to secure domestic supply chains for vital minerals used in energy infrastructure and defense, reducing reliance on China's dominance in the critical minerals market.

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a controversial plan to allow state lawmakers to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, is a central issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race. Backed by Governor Newsom, the effort aims to create more Democratic House seats, countering Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. However, it faces strong opposition from Republicans and Green Party candidates, who condemn it as "corrupt," "unconstitutional," and a partisan power grab. Even some Democrats express unease, acknowledging the ethical dilemma of fighting one partisan maneuver with another. Voters will decide on the proposition in a special election on November 4th.</p>

Matthew Turtle, director of the museum, stated these figures underscore profound systemic failures. While London saw the highest total deaths, Nottingham and Exeter experienced the largest proportional increases.
