          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian Prime Minister has achieved consecutive terms. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell by 0.83%, reversing previous gains, as most Asian markets remained closed for holidays. This decline reflects investor apprehension amid global macroeconomic uncertainty, though the Australian dollar saw a slight increase against the U.S. dollar. The article notes the strengthening of the New Taiwanese dollar and a drop in oil prices following OPEC+'s decision to increase production.</p>

          <p>China is striving to redirect exports, originally destined for the U.S., to its domestic market in response to high tariffs, potentially intensifying deflationary pressures. Local governments and major e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Douyin are supporting this shift by offering substantial discounts on these goods to Chinese consumers. However, this influx of discounted products could erode companies' profitability, leading to job losses and weakened consumer demand. The article highlights concerns from economists at Barclays and Morgan Stanley about the impact of tariffs on China's CPI and PPI.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced intentions to impose a 100% tariff on films produced outside the United States, citing concerns that other nations are luring American filmmakers overseas. He claims this is a national security threat and a concerted effort by other nations to undermine Hollywood. This move, if implemented, would mark the first time Trump has imposed tariffs on services rather than manufactured goods.

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address England's social care system for older and disabled adults is unsustainable, costing the country financially and in human terms. The report highlights that taxpayers are currently paying £32 billion a year for a broken system propped up by unpaid carers. The committee recommends investing in the system to improve care quality and drive economic growth, suggesting that an extra £1 billion spent on social care could create 50,000 jobs. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and states that it has already taken action on social care.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. They argue that the campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is limited, and that internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a contributing factor. In the past two years, several members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) have been targeted, indicating a significant effort to address corruption within the military.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he is directing the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the former prison on an island off the coast of California, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. He stated that this action would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice. The prison, which closed in 1963, is currently a tourist site. Trump cited the need to address vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders as the reason for reopening the facility.</p>

          <p>Finance ministers and central bank governors from ASEAN countries, along with Japan, China, and South Korea, have cautioned against the potential global economic repercussions of protectionist trade policies following the U.S.'s implementation of higher import tariffs.

Sheinbaum confirmed the proposal, stating Mexico and the United States can collaborate, but each must remain within their own territory.

A DOJ spokesperson suggested it will still honor victims in other ways, but not only of gun violence.

In both countries, center-left incumbents surged ahead of conservative oppositions. Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message, while Australia's leader, Anthony Albanese, did not, but both benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. In Germany, the effect of the Trump factor has been less direct, but has still been felt.</p>

          <p>Wind farms in La Guajira, Colombia, are bringing both promise and pain for the Wayuu indigenous group. While the projects offer access to clean water, better roads, and sturdy houses, they also create division within the Wayuu communities. Concerns have been raised about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.</p>
