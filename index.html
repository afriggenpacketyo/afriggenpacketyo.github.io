          <p>Palantir Technologies has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 NYSE debut, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $432 billion. The company, co-founded by Alex Karp and Peter Thiel, has expanded its customer base significantly, with quarterly revenue surpassing $1 billion. This growth is partly attributed to its AI platform (AIP), launched in 2023, which helps integrate large language models with sensitive data. Despite its financial success, Palantir faces ongoing criticism regarding its government contracts, including work with ICE and the Trump administration, and its support for the Ukrainian and Israeli militaries, prompting some employee departures.

He emphasizes consistent monthly contributions and staying invested through short-term fluctuations, believing younger generations have significant opportunities to build wealth due to accessible market knowledge. Cramer encourages owning quality growth stocks and allowing gains to compound rather than frequent trading, a philosophy he details in his new book, "How to Make Money in Any Market."

          <p>Victor Tony Jones, 64, was executed in Florida for a 1990 double murder, marking the state's 13th execution this year, which surpasses its previous annual record. Jones was convicted in 1993 for stabbing Matilda and Jacob Nestor during a robbery, with Jacob Nestor managing to shoot Jones before succumbing to his wounds. Florida now leads the nation in executions for 2025, with two more scheduled for October, continuing its active use of capital punishment. This article details the somber specifics of Jones's case, his final moments, and the broader context of Florida's execution rate.</p>

          <p>As a government shutdown looms, House Democrats are intensifying pressure on Republicans, with a Democratic funding bill including healthcare provisions failing in the Senate. President Trump blames Democrats, falsely claiming they seek healthcare guarantees for immigrants without legal status, and warns of federal layoffs. Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed this sentiment in a memo to Justice Department staff, preparing for potential furloughs and curtailment of civil litigation activities. This article highlights the escalating political stalemate and blame game surrounding the impending federal funding lapse, underscoring the deep partisan divide.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to sell discounted drugs directly to consumers via a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, set to launch in 2026. This initiative aims to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed nations, with Pfizer agreeing to 50% average discounts on its drugs for uninsured patients. Critics, however, view the plan as "window dressing," arguing it offers limited benefits to average consumers and may not significantly reduce overall drug costs. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised Pfizer's CEO for setting a template for corporate responsibility in public health.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Canada Post workers are on a nationwide strike, halting mail deliveries across the country. The strike protests widespread government reforms, including ending door-to-door delivery and closing some post offices, which the union argues will lead to major job losses. This industrial action follows an unresolved dispute over pay and benefits from a previous strike last year. Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasizes the necessity of "significant changes" for Canada Post's financial viability, as the corporation faces years of losses and declining mail volumes. Negotiations continue, with the government not ruling out federal intervention to end the strike.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation, violating their First Amendment rights. Judge William Young delivered a scathing assessment, accusing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio of misusing their powers to suppress lawful speech and "terrorize" students into silence. The ruling follows a trial examining arrests and detentions of student activists, which the judge found were aimed at reaching "foregone conclusions for most ignoble ends."

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, a new law requiring "frontier" AI model developers to provide transparency reports detailing their approaches to mitigating "catastrophic risks." The law defines catastrophic risk as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, potentially from AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. This legislation aims to regulate fast-moving AI technology before widespread disasters occur, establishing safety frameworks, incident reporting, and whistleblower protections. While some industry groups opposed it as burdensome, proponents view it as a crucial step for AI governance, potentially influencing future federal legislation.</p>

Rollins expressed concern that the bailout led Argentina to remove export tariffs on grains, causing soybean prices to drop and allowing China to buy from Latin America instead of the U.S. This shift gives China more leverage and negatively impacts American soybean farmers, who have already suffered from President Trump’s tariff wars.
