          <p>Despite claims from the Trump Organization that its new T1 smartphone will be "built in the United States," tech industry experts believe the device will likely be manufactured in China. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, is expected to be designed and manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). Analysts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of designing the phone from scratch domestically as reasons for their skepticism. The experts also point out that large-scale manufacturing in the U.S. would take several years to establish and would substantially increase the product's price. The phone's true origin is in contradiction with Trump's desire to have more electronics manufacturing be undertaken in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027, and will immediately cease creating new products with these dyes. This decision follows a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic dyes with natural alternatives in the nation's food supply. The company has already replaced artificial dyes in Kraft Mac & Cheese in 2016, and some products, such as Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never contained dyes. The FDA is also working to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, depending on voluntary efforts from the food industry.</p>

Kiernan Tague, who was 16 at the time of the incident, pleaded guilty to manslaughter with a motor vehicle after driving approximately 100 mph in a 25-mph zone, resulting in the death of 18-year-old Flynn MacKrell. Tague received a "blended sentence" and will serve probation at a Level two placement facility, a decision that has been met with strong disapproval from the victim's mother, Anne Vanker. Vanker criticizes the justice system for failing to hold Tague fully accountable for his actions, citing his history of reckless driving and lack of remorse.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its meeting on Wednesday, signaling ongoing caution amid economic uncertainty. According to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, there is a 99.9% likelihood that the Fed will hold steady, a decision influenced by the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs and a slight increase in the inflation rate. While consumer sentiment has improved, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains exceeding expectations. The Fed's decision will likely keep credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages high, benefiting savers who can capitalize on higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery increased by 2.2% to $73.35 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August rose by 2.49% to $75.05. Despite the conflict, the oil market has remained relatively calm due to ample crude supplies, with OPEC+ increasing production and U.S. output remaining at record levels. While initial fears centered on potential strikes on Iran's oil infrastructure, Israel has largely avoided installations that export to the global market.</p>

          <p>President Trump's early departure from the Group of Seven summit was prompted by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, after urging people to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran for regional instability. Trump dismissed French President Macron's comments about a ceasefire offer, stating that the situation was "much bigger than that." The G7 economies called for a resolution to the "Iranian crisis" and a broader de-escalation of hostilities, while China has condemned Israel's attack and sought to play a peacemaking role. The conflict has overshadowed other agenda items at the G7 summit, including Trump's tariff policy and its impact on global economic growth.</p>

          <p>A Dutch children's book celebrating Amsterdam's diversity has sparked outrage within the Netherlands' Chinese community due to a section criticized for being discriminatory. The book contains a game where players landing on a specific square are instructed to move back because "Chinese tourists are blocking the bike lane." Members of the Chinese-Dutch community say this reinforces negative racial stereotypes and portrays Chinese people as a public nuisance. The controversy has prompted protests and discussions about anti-Asian racism, leading to a response from Amsterdam's mayor and the book's publisher, who expressed regret and promised corrective action.</p>

          <p>Homebuilder sentiment in June dropped to 32 on the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI), nearing pandemic lows due to higher mortgage rates and broader economic uncertainty. The index has only been lower twice since 2012, during the pandemic's onset and after mortgage rates spiked in 2022. A growing number of builders are cutting prices to address affordability concerns and bring hesitant buyers off the fence. The report follows quarterly earnings from Lennar, one of the nation's largest homebuilders, in which the second-quarter average home price dropped nearly 9% from the same quarter in 2024.

          <p>An overnight Russian missile and drone bombardment of Ukraine resulted in 15 deaths and 156 injuries, with a nine-story Kyiv apartment building being demolished in the deadliest attack on the capital this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the attack as "pure terrorism," with over 440 drones and 32 missiles fired. A U.S. citizen was among those killed, suffering shrapnel wounds, and Ukraine has urged its citizens to leave Israel and Iran due to escalating tensions. The attack occurred after failed peace talks and amid intensified Russian aerial attacks and a summer offensive on eastern and northeastern sections of the front line.</p>

          <p>A mass missile and drone attack by Russia on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, has resulted in at least 10 deaths and over 100 injuries, with a drone smashing into an apartment block and destroying dozens of flats. Ukraine's interior minister reported that the country had been hit by 440 drones and 32 missiles in what President Volodymyr Zelensky described as "one of the most terrifying strikes." The attack lasted more than nine hours, forcing residents to seek shelter, and an entrance to a nine-story apartment building in the Solomyanskyi district collapsed. Kyiv has launched attacks of its own, as direct talks between the warring sides failed to secure a ceasefire or significant breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time, representing 44.8% of total TV viewership in May, according to Nielsen. This milestone is driven by the rise of free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, the growth of YouTube, and shifts within legacy media companies. YouTube's main division, excluding YouTube TV, climbed 120% since 2021, representing 12.5% of all television viewing in May. Traditional media companies are increasingly embracing streaming, with platforms like Hulu, Paramount+, and Peacock complementing linear TV, and Nielsen predicts that streaming will eventually become the dominant form of TV viewing permanently.</p>

Ryan described returning to the show as feeling "like coming home."

          <p>The article explores the cultural shift of women embracing strength and muscles, challenging traditional beauty standards. While muscles have long been associated with male strength and power, women are increasingly engaging in strength training, driven by new scientific studies and a desire to reject the male gaze. However, the article questions whether the pursuit of muscularity could lead to new forms of body neuroses and optimization traps. It references three new books that delve into the cultural symbolism of muscles and the changing ideals of the "well" woman, who is not only thin but also relentlessly optimizes her health.</p>

Official figures show that more than 1,500 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats last week, pushing the total for the year to just over 16,000, which is 42% higher than at the same point last year. Ministers have been pushing for the French government to implement new rules to make it easier to intercept boats.

Instead, Trump got a "festive" parade, said the author. Social media users noted that the soldiers werenâ€™t marching in lockstep during the parade as they made their way down Constitution Avenue in downtown Washington, D.C. The White House has dismissed Wolff's claims, while Trump has called the parade a "tremendous success."</p>
