          <p>A UK parliamentary intelligence committee has issued a stark warning that the threat from Iran is rising, persistent, and unpredictable. The report highlights a significant increase in physical threats, including assassination and kidnapping plots against dissidents and Jewish interests on UK soil since early 2022. The committee criticized the government's approach as reactive "fire-fighting," urging a more strategic, long-term, and better-resourced plan to counter the wide-ranging security risks posed by Tehran's well-funded intelligence services.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in rare earth mining company MP Materials through a $400 million preferred stock purchase. This strategic investment aims to bolster domestic processing and magnet production capabilities, reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals essential for defense and technology sectors. The announcement caused MP Materials' shares to surge over 40%, reflecting market confidence in the move to secure a vital national supply chain.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have declared a major incident over a large loyalist bonfire scheduled for the annual Eleventh Night celebrations. Authorities are concerned because the structure's proximity to a major electricity substation poses a risk to the power supply for two nearby hospitals, including the Royal Victoria Hospital. Despite bonfire builders voluntarily removing some pallets as an "olive branch," tensions have escalated as the city council requested police assistance to dismantle the structure, prompting protests and legal challenges.</p>

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where officials anticipated flooding due to recent wildfire "burn scars," the community was ready, resulting in fewer casualties despite significant property damage. In contrast, the ferocity of the flood in Texas caught officials and residents by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 120 people. The comparison underscores how recent experience and proactive risk assessment can dramatically influence a community's resilience to natural disasters.</p>

          <p>A search and rescue operation is underway in the Red Sea for more than a dozen crew members of a Greek-owned cargo ship, the Eternity C, following an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels. The Iran-backed militants reportedly killed at least three crew members in a sustained assault, with the US embassy accusing the Houthis of also taking some sailors hostage. This incident marks the second cargo ship sunk by the rebels in recent days, as they continue to target vessels in the vital shipping lane in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis article highlights Chevron and TotalEnergies as attractive high-yield energy stocks for investors.

The article recommends TotalEnergies for its aggressive investment in the clean energy transition, using profits from fossil fuels to build a diversified, future-focused electricity business while still increasing its dividend.

          <p>UK regulator Ofcom has approved Royal Mail's plan to reform its service, which includes ending second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and moving to an every-other-weekday schedule. The change, intended to save the company up to £425 million annually, comes as the volume of letters sent has plummeted, making the six-day universal service obligation financially unsustainable. While Royal Mail welcomed the move as necessary for survival, consumer and business groups criticized the decision, fearing it will reduce service reliability while prices continue to rise.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court in her case against World Athletics. The legal battle concerns rules that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD), like Semenya, to medically lower their natural testosterone levels to compete. While the ruling does not overturn the controversial regulations, it keeps her long-running legal fight alive and renews scrutiny on rules that critics argue are discriminatory.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which caused an estimated $18 to $22 billion in damages, underscore a critical gap in homeowner protection, as standard insurance policies typically exclude flood damage. In the hard-hit Kerr County, only about 2.5% of homeowners had separate flood insurance coverage, leaving many to face financial ruin. Experts stress that flooding is a nationwide risk, with 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event, and urge homeowners even outside of designated high-risk zones to consider purchasing coverage through the National Flood Insurance Program or private insurers.</p>

          <p>A Republican spending bill signed by President Trump provides a massive $75 billion cash infusion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over four years, a 308% annual increase over its 2024 budget. The funding is set to nearly triple immigration detention capacity to 116,000 beds and provides a blank check for enforcement and removal operations. Critics worry the resources will be used to implement indiscriminate and inhumane policies, undermining due process and expanding the criminalization of immigrants as the administration aims to deport one million people annually.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to cut most U.S. foreign aid is causing significant concern in South Africa, which has the world's highest number of people living with HIV. The cuts have led to the closure of many USAID-funded clinics that provided free antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to vulnerable populations, including sex workers. Health experts and advocates fear this will reverse decades of progress, leading to a spike in new infections and deaths as patients struggle to access medication through an already strained public healthcare system.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could significantly alter California's political dynamics, drawing lessons from its recent use in New York City. In California's nonpartisan "jungle primary" system, RCV could eliminate the need for costly separate runoff elections in local races and potentially give underrepresented parties a better chance in state contests. Proponents argue the system encourages more civil campaigning, improves representation, and saves taxpayer money, though its full effect on the state's political makeup remains a subject of debate.</p>

The revelations have prompted calls for an independent inquiry into the institution's handling of abuse, with the Church in Wales issuing an apology for its failings and promising a review of its culture.</p>

The new map shifts people of color to consolidate Republican power in what has become a competitive "purple" county, a move the county judge openly admitted was to elect another Republican. Experts view this local effort as a blueprint for a broader GOP strategy to offset potential midterm election losses in other states by stacking the deck in Texas, a state where a contentious primary is already exposing deep party divisions.</p>
