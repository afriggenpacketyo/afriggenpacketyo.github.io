          <p>Dispatch audio from Texas's recent catastrophic floods reveals that Kerr County officials waited 90 minutes to issue a CodeRED emergency alert after firefighters requested it. The first request came at 4:22 a.m. as the Guadalupe River began to flood, but bureaucratic approval delayed the warning. Some alerts did not reach residents until after 10 a.m., hours after the initial danger was identified, by which time many people had been caught in the floodwaters. The county sheriff has deferred questions, promising an "after-action" review of the response to the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, identified as Darcy Deefholts, has been safely rescued after being reported missing at sea. He went for a surf on Wednesday afternoon near Wooli, New South Wales, and a search was launched when he failed to return home. Deefholts was discovered the following day on North Solitary Island, a small, uninhabited island located about seven miles offshore. His father described the rescue as a "one in a million miracle," expressing immense relief after fearing the worst for his son, who is now receiving medical attention.</p>

          <p>A group of passengers created a chaotic situation aboard a XiamenAir flight in China by attempting to storm the business-class cabin while the plane was taxiing. The incident occurred on flight MF8330, traveling from Changsha to Fuzhou. The disruptive fans were reportedly trying to get close to Chinese actor Tian Xuning, who was seated in the premium section of the aircraft. Their actions disrupted the normal procedures on the taxiing plane, highlighting an extreme example of fan behavior that compromised safety and order during a critical phase of the flight.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after a partial collapse occurred in a new industrial wastewater tunnel in Los Angeles. The workers were approximately 400 feet underground when the cave-in happened, trapping them between the entrance and the tunnel boring machine. They managed to navigate over a 12-foot-high pile of loose soil to reach the machine and were then transported to safety, with none sustaining major injuries. The $700 million project is now under investigation to determine the cause of the collapse before work can resume.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of optimism, fueled by both political and sporting developments. A recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, if it holds, could bring stability to the violence-plagued eastern region, allowing for economic and social recovery. Concurrently, the men's national football team is leading its qualification group for the 2026 World Cup, a potential first appearance since 1974. Experts believe that both peace and a World Cup berth could attract investment, foster unity, and provide new opportunities for the nation's youth.</p>

          <p>Consumers in the United States are observing rising prices for everyday items like t-shirts and footwear, an effect they attribute to ongoing trade disputes. Retailers, particularly department stores such as Macy's, are grappling with new tariffs on imported goods, forcing them to either absorb the costs or pass them on to customers. A recent study confirmed price hikes in apparel and footwear, and with further tariffs potentially being imposed, more increases could be forthcoming. While some shoppers have yet to notice significant changes due to sales and coupons, the uncertainty is affecting retailers' financial forecasts and consumer budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

Whitehouse, who recently delivered his 300th climate speech in the Senate, urged his party to be more aggressive in exposing this alleged fraud.

          <p>Following a recent 12-day military conflict involving Iran, Israel, and the United States, analysts predict that China will likely strengthen its support for Iran. This move is seen as a strategic effort by Beijing to secure its interests in the volatile region and counter worries about political instability within the Islamic Republic. However, this support presents a delicate balancing act for China, as it must avoid damaging its relationships with key Arab nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The situation is being closely watched globally, especially after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu did not rule out targeting Iran's supreme leader.</p>

          <h2>Volkswagen Halts U.S. Deliveries of ID.Buzz Electric Van, Citing Tariffs and a Recall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 02:52:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has temporarily stopped delivering its ID.Buzz electric van to the United States. According to company sources cited by the newspaper Handelsblatt, the decision was influenced by two key factors. The first is the high U.S. tariffs on European-built cars, which recently increased from 2.5% to 27.5%. The second factor is a safety recall issued by U.S. regulators concerning the van's third-row seating. This halt in deliveries exemplifies the direct impact of trade policy and regulatory hurdles on the automotive industry's international operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union remains in a state of uncertainty as it awaits a decision from Washington on a potential trade agreement that would avert steep new tariffs. While the U.S. administration has sent letters outlining new duties to numerous other countries, the EU has so far been spared, with talks reportedly ongoing. U.S. officials have acknowledged that the EU has made "significant, real offers" to lower trade barriers, particularly for American agricultural products. However, with no firm deal in place, Brussels is preparing for all scenarios, including the imposition of a baseline 10% tariff on its goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have announced a major advance in surgical robotics, revealing that a robot has autonomously performed a realistic gallbladder removal with 100% accuracy. The machine, trained on surgical videos using an AI model similar to that of ChatGPT, operated with the skill of an expert human surgeon, even when faced with unexpected scenarios. It was also able to learn from voice commands, adapting to feedback like a surgical trainee. This development marks a significant step toward clinically viable autonomous systems that can function in the unpredictable environment of a real operating room.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has drawn sharp criticism for claiming that one in six survivors of the Lahaina wildfires in Hawaii were forced to trade sexual favors for basic supplies. The claim appears to be based on a report about female Filipino survivors, but one of the report's authors called Noem's statement a "gross manipulation" of their findings. The original report found that 16 percent of 70 respondents had engaged in "survival sex," but with landlords, employers, and acquaintances, not as a requirement for official aid. Critics accuse the administration of misinterpreting the data to attack FEMA's response under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated in a BBC interview that his own Democratic party had "missed" on the issue of immigration for years, allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to be "under siege." He believes this failure created a political opening for Republicans like Donald Trump. Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, said he wished President Biden had been heard more often affirming his commitment to enforcing border law. His comments highlight the deep internal debate within the Democratic party over its immigration policies and how to respond to the current administration's aggressive enforcement actions.</p>

He contended that the yuan has already shown resilience and stability during recent periods of global stress, such as the war in Ukraine and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective adds to the ongoing debate about the yuan's internationalization as confidence in the U.S. dollar faces challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are anchored by a large and stable social-housing sector. This sector comprises about 43% of the city's housing units and serves not only low-income residents but also middle-class households, keeping rent levels significantly lower than in the private market. The system, originating in the 1920s and financed partly by a levy on employee salaries, has resisted the privatization seen in other major European cities. While access can be complex, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers a powerful model for other cities.</p>

These pulses create illusions that command the bee to fly in specific directions, with a reported 90% success rate.

The White House justified the move by stating that copper is a critical material for the Department of Defense and is essential for manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and batteries. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of the copper it consumes, primarily from Chile. Experts predict the tariff will cause a significant price increase for U.S. consumers and may create domestic shortages before local production can be ramped up. (not investment advice)</p>
