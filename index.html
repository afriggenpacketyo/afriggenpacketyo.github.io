          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 18:28:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the increasing federal government debt and the high costs of refinancing existing debt due to elevated interest rates. The rating agency highlighted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits. This downgrade is expected to marginally increase the yield investors demand for U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively affect sentiment towards U.S. assets. The article also notes that Moody's action aligns with previous downgrades by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had already lowered the U.S. rating to AA+.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 7-2 ruling, the Supreme Court extended an injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court found that the government did not provide adequate time or information for detainees to contest their removals, remanding the case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine the necessary due process. President Trump criticized the decision, while the ACLU praised the court for pausing the use of the Act, and the order only prevents removals under the Alien Enemies Act proclamation, allowing the government to pursue deportations under other lawful authorities.</p>

Administration officials like Kristi Noem and Tulsi Gabbard publicly commented on the post, with Gabbard suggesting Comey should be jailed. Critics argue that Trump officials are using the post to harass one of Trump‚Äôs perceived enemies, as Comey has long been a target of Mr. Trump‚Äôs ire since the F.B.I. investigated potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, including one convicted of four killings, escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, triggering a large-scale search operation. The inmates reportedly escaped by tearing off a toilet-sink appliance and exiting through a loading dock, with authorities suspecting a lapse in security and possible internal help. One inmate was caught after a foot chase in the French Quarter. The jail has faced scrutiny over civil rights violations, leading to a reform pact with the federal government in 2016, and officials have promised a thorough investigation into the escape.</p>

While the Georgia Attorney General stated the law doesn't require keeping a brain-dead woman on life support, the hospital cited concerns about violating the state's abortion ban, creating ethical and legal complexities.

          <p>A new CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The study, one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs, found that 51 drowning deaths could be prevented with better pool fencing, and 297 with life jackets during boating accidents. The research highlights the potential for saving lives and reducing economic costs by implementing these known prevention strategies, while also noting the elimination of the CDC's drowning prevention research team due to layoffs.</p>

A reconciliation bill in Congress could penalize states that use their own funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, potentially costing states billions of dollars.</p>

Council executed a SIM swap attack, printing a fake driver's license to reassign the victim's cell phone number.
