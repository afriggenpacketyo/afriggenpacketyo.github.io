            <p>Wall Street experienced a rollercoaster week, marked by significant swings driven by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Despite initial anxieties, stocks rallied on Friday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq Composite all posting substantial gains, marking the best weekly performance since November 2023 for the S&P 500. This rebound occurred even as China announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, matching the duties imposed by President Trump earlier in the week. The market's resilience suggests investors are cautiously optimistic about potential negotiations, though analysts warn that the trade war's impact on corporate profits and the broader economy remains a concern.

            <p>Mikal Mahdi was executed by firing squad in South Carolina, marking the state's second recent death row killing by authorized gunfire as they aggressively revive capital punishment. Mahdi was convicted for the 2004 killing of a public safety officer. His lawyers argued against the execution, citing his abusive childhood and an unfair trial, but appeals were rejected. South Carolina resumed executions last year due to a shortage of lethal injection drugs, now offering inmates a choice between the electric chair, lethal injection, and firing squad. Mahdi's lawyers stated he chose to be shot as the 'lesser of three evils'.</p>

            <p>A group of former OpenAI employees has filed a brief supporting Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, raising concerns about its transition to a for-profit entity. The ex-staffers, who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2024, argue that converting to a for-profit structure would violate the company's original mission and breach the trust of stakeholders. Musk's lawsuit alleges that OpenAI abandoned its founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity. OpenAI has filed a countersuit, accusing Musk of attempting to harm the company. The legal battle underscores the ongoing debate about the ethical implications of AI development and the balance between profit and public benefit.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, his first such exam of his second term. While details are limited, the White House promised to release a summary of the findings, emphasizing transparency.

His last official checkup in 2018 revealed 'excellent' cardiovascular shape for his age, despite high cholesterol and being overweight.

            <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors and attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez faced off in court as the new District Attorney seeks to overturn a prior recommendation that the brothers receive a lighter sentence for the murders of their parents.

The case has gained renewed attention following a Netflix documentary and new evidence suggesting their father sexually abused them. A hearing is set for April 17 to decide whether to re-sentence the brothers, with their attorneys arguing for their release based on their rehabilitation and the new evidence of abuse.</p>

            <p>Residents in the Los Angeles area are crowdsourcing data on wildfire contamination after struggling to get their insurance companies to cover testing for toxins like lead and asbestos in their homes. Many residents worry that smoke from the Eaton wildfire carried toxins into their homes, but insurers are denying claims for testing. The residents formed Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing data and compiling results on an online map, revealing elevated lead levels in tested homes. They hope this data will help others convince insurers to cover testing and remediation, highlighting gaps in insurance coverage and a lack of government assistance.</p>

            <p>USA Fencing is under federal investigation following an incident at an event where a female fencer was penalized for refusing to compete against a transgender athlete. The investigation, led by the Department of Education and Department of Justice, stems from a protest by fencer Stephanie Turner against the organization's gender eligibility policies. USA Fencing has stated it will cooperate with the inquiry. The incident has sparked debate over transgender inclusion in sports and the fairness of competition.

            <p>"The Amateur," starring Rami Malek, presents a promising premise of a CIA decoder turned vengeful spy after his wife's murder. However, despite a talented cast and stylish direction, the film falls short on suspense and mystery. Malek's portrayal of the timid-turned-determined protagonist is commendable, but the plot lacks surprises, making the film feel predictable. While the movie explores the emotional journey of grief and revenge, it fails to create a thrilling experience, ultimately resulting in a dull narrative execution.</p>

            <p>A Trump-appointed judge has accused the White House of cherry-picking testimony and misconstruing facts in its attempt to delay the restoration of the Associated Press' access to the White House press pool. The judge rejected the government's request for a stay pending appeal, reiterating his finding that the White House retaliated against the AP in violation of its First Amendment rights. The ruling underscores the ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the media, with concerns raised about press freedom and access to information.</p>

            <p>Kevin Macdonald's documentary, "One to One: John & Yoko," focuses on 18 months in the lives of John Lennon and Yoko Ono after the Beatles' breakup, aiming for an immersive look at their creativity, political activism, and romantic relationship. The film centers around Lennon's only full-length post-Beatles concert, the One to One benefit show in 1972. Macdonald explores the couple's mindset during a time of deep division in America, suggesting their music and advocacy grew out of the visual maelstrom of television and societal unrest. The documentary eschews nostalgia to illustrate the humanness of its subjects.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for the Trump administration were unable to tell a federal court the whereabouts or condition of a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador last month, prompting strong criticism from the judge. The judge demanded daily updates on the government's efforts to bring the man home, expressing concern that the administration had failed to comply with a court order. The case highlights tensions between the administration and federal courts, as well as concerns about immigration enforcement practices. The deported man has had a US work permit since 2019.</p>

            <p>The future of American AI leadership is in jeopardy due to the Trump administration's policies, which have frozen, canceled, or slowed billions of dollars in grants and fired hundreds of staff from federal agencies that have funded the nation’s pioneering academic research for decades. This is impacting universities, leading to hiring freezes and canceled research projects. Despite Trump’s outward support for AI, his actions are eroding the engine of scientific innovation in America. The United States now risks losing ground to Canada, Europe, and China in the race for AI and other technological innovation.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained last month over his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. The administration cited a Cold War-era immigration law, claiming Khalil's presence in the U.S. was adverse to American foreign policy interests. Khalil's lawyers argued that he was being targeted for his political views, while the ACLU described the decision as 'pre-written.' The judge's ruling came less than 48 hours after the U.S. government 'handed over the 'evidence' they have on Mr. Khalil.'</p>

The article suggests that the groups least reflective of Facebook’s transactional ethos are the most effective at achieving its purported goal of actually linking people.</p>

The project, costing $860 million to $925 million, aims to reduce wildfire risk and power outages. The underground lines will replace damaged infrastructure in high-fire-risk areas. SCE hopes to collaborate with local, state, and federal entities for funding to avoid raising customer rates. The plan excludes transmission lines due to feasibility issues, focusing on distribution lines connecting homes and businesses.</p>
