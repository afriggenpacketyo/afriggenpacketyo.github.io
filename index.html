          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan, targeting what it called "terrorist infrastructure" in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The operation, named "Operation Sindoor," was a response to a militant attack last month in Kashmir that resulted in 26 deaths. India stated that the actions were measured and non-escalatory, avoiding Pakistani military facilities, while Pakistan accused India of violating its territorial sovereignty, claiming 26 Pakistanis were killed and 46 injured. The conflict has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations, prompting international concerns and calls for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Bank of America strategists report that investors are moving capital out of U.S. equities into European and Japanese markets, triggered by volatility stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. U.S. equities experienced an $8.9 billion outflow in one week, while European equities saw a $3.4 billion inflow, and Japanese equities saw their biggest week of inflows since April 2024 at $4.4 billion. This shift indicates a risk-taking mood among investors, as cryptocurrencies and high-yield bonds also saw inflows, while gold and U.S. Treasury bonds experienced outflows.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its full-year sales growth forecast downward due to the impact of copycat drug compounders on Wegovy sales, despite reporting a better-than-expected first-quarter net profit. While sales of Wegovy rose 83%, they fell slightly short of analyst expectations, leading the company to project sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. First-quarter sales of Ozempic, another key diabetes treatment, exceeded expectations, but the overall adjustment reflects challenges in the competitive weight loss drug market.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal designed to reduce costs and simplify trade between the two nations, with the UK reducing taxes on goods imported from India, such as clothing, food products, and jewelry, while India has cut taxes on UK goods like cosmetics, scotch whisky, and medical devices. The UK government anticipates that this agreement will increase trade by an additional Â£25.5 billion annually by 2040 and boost the UK economy by Â£4.8 billion over time. While the deal is not expected to have immediate effects, it could provide significant advantages for UK businesses in industries like car manufacturing and whisky distilling.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has cautioned that U.S. restrictions on sales to China will result in a $1.5 billion reduction in revenue this year, despite an otherwise optimistic outlook for 2025. The guidance is a direct result of an export restriction imposed in April that targeted AMDâ€™s MI308 chips, causing a predicted $700 million decline in data center revenue for the current period. CEO Lisa Su remains confident about overall demand for AI infrastructure and expects new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year, though investors remain concerned about trade restrictions and competition with Nvidia.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed concerns about potentially losing access to China's artificial intelligence (AI) market, estimating the market's value at $50 billion within the next few years. Huang stressed that it would be a significant loss for an American company to be unable to participate, highlighting the importance of the Chinese market to Nvidia's revenue. These comments come as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls, which have restricted the company's ability to sell its advanced AI chips to China.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid rising trade concerns. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts suggest these measures may have a limited impact on domestic credit demand, they indicate a greater urgency from officials to stabilize Chinaâ€™s financial markets and attract foreign investment.</p>

          <p>A 14-year-old from Essex, named Finley, suffers from a rare digestive condition that prevents him from eating due to an inability to tolerate lipids. Since the age of four, Finley has received weekly lipid infusions directly into his heart, a six-hour process that has recently increased to twice a week. Finley's case is so rare that doctors are considering presenting it to a medical journal, as he may be the only person whose body reacts to lipids in this way, and he has plans to abseil down a tower block at Southend Hospital on 16 May to raise money for the Mid and South Essex Hospitals Charity.</p>
