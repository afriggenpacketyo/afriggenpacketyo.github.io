          <p>Anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activists in Denver, Colorado, reportedly helped Jose Reyes Leon-Deras, a criminal alien from El Salvador convicted of child sexual assault in Italy, evade arrest. The group, Colorado Rapid Response, allegedly alerted Leon-Deras to ICE's presence via social media, giving him time to flee. ICE has requested public assistance in locating Leon-Deras, while warning people not to approach him. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston had previously pledged to hinder ICE deportations, and the city has allocated substantial funds for migrant services.</p>

The tests showed faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following this mission, China is proposing national technical standards to guide the use of OpenHarmony in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with failing heart function and a history of complications, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Baker had been living with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for four years before developing dangerous heart rhythms and a high risk of organ rejection. Doctors decided to perform a combined heart-liver transplant to address the antibody issue, a procedure never before done on a patient with an LVAD. While the surgery was successful, Baker faces financial challenges due to medical bills and her husband's recent death.</p>

Critics argue that Afghanistan remains unsafe, particularly for minorities, women, and those who assisted foreign efforts. The Department of Homeland Security claims the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but bipartisan lawmakers express concern over the threat of persecution under Taliban rule.</p>

          <p>The article argues that a war with Iran would be perilous to American democracy, given Donald Trump's dictatorial control over law enforcement and the military. It suggests that Trump could exploit a state of war to strengthen his power at home, suppress dissent, and violate citizens' rights. The author also raises concerns about potential terrorist attacks and the global implications of a war led by anti-liberal forces. The author concludes that the United States is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship, and war with Iran would hasten its demise.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the use of sexual assault as a plot device in Celine Song's film "Materialists," drawing a comparison to a similar plot point in the movie "Showgirls." In "Materialists," a character is sexually assaulted, and the protagonist finds strength and emotional growth through this event. The author questions the use of this trope, particularly in a film marketed as a rom-com, and suggests it feels cynical as a means of character development.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, a shift from her previous testimony before Congress. The US Director of National Intelligence stated her earlier testimony had been taken out of context.

This development comes amid escalating tensions and discussions about potential US involvement in military action against Iran.</p>
