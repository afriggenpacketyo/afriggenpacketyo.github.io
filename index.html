        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to remove Lisa Cook from her role as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board. The court's 2-1 decision keeps in place a lower court's ruling that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act, which stipulates a president can only remove a governor "for cause" related to in-office conduct. The administration had sought to oust Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud predating her tenure, a move critics argue threatens the central bank's independence. This ruling ensures Cook will participate in the upcoming interest rate-setting committee meeting, though a Supreme Court appeal is anticipated.</p>

Lombardo, who was the only challenger to defeat an incumbent governor in 2022, is positioning himself as a bulwark against progressive policies from neighboring California. In his announcement, he highlighted his administration's achievements, including regulatory cuts, job growth, and investments in education and law enforcement. Democrats are targeting his seat, labeling him the most vulnerable Republican governor and criticizing his record on unemployment and housing costs, setting the stage for a competitive race.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in a narrow 48-47 vote. His confirmation comes just before a critical meeting to decide on interest rates, amplifying concerns about the central bank's political independence. The controversy is heightened by Miran's decision to take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than resigning, a move Democrats argue undermines the Fed's autonomy. While Miran has pledged to preserve the institution's independence, his appointment gives the president greater influence over U.S. monetary policy during a pivotal economic period.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index reached a historic high, closing above the 45,000 mark for the first time, leading a rally across Asia-Pacific markets. The surge was fueled by investor optimism following President Trump's positive comments on trade negotiations with China and a framework deal for the divestment of TikTok. U.S. markets also saw gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new records as investors anticipate a key Federal Reserve meeting. This market performance reflects a positive reaction to perceived progress in resolving international trade disputes and corporate restructuring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Four Key Strategies for Effective Autumn Decluttering</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn begins, experts suggest that decluttering living spaces can significantly reduce stress and enhance energy levels. A BBC feature outlines four practical strategies for effective tidying, starting with manageable tasks like a single drawer to avoid feeling overwhelmed. It is also crucial to pre-plan disposal methods, such as donations or sales, to prevent clutter from accumulating elsewhere. The advice emphasizes prioritizing quality over quantity by keeping items that bring joy and tell a personal story. Finally, understanding the difference between nostalgia for the past and sentimental value in the present can help in making decisions to let items go.</p>

          <p>In a somber gathering at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders held a vigil to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated.

The event, attended by numerous Republican lawmakers and a few Democrats, highlighted the deep sense of shock and grief within the political community. The vigil served as a moment of reflection on political violence and its impact on the nation's discourse.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Vice President JD Vance and senior White House aide Stephen Miller have promised retribution against what they term a left-wing "domestic terror movement." Speaking on Kirk's podcast, Miller asserted that the administration would use all government resources to dismantle these networks, directly linking them to Kirk's death despite an unclear motive. Vance further urged the public to take action against anyone perceived to be celebrating the killing, including contacting their employers.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is re-evaluating the prominent "black box" warnings on menopause hormone therapy drugs, which currently caution against risks like stroke and breast cancer. This reconsideration is based on newer research suggesting that a flawed 2002 study overstated these dangers, particularly for younger women who begin treatment closer to menopause. Medical experts argue that for many, the benefits of hormone therapy in alleviating severe perimenopausal symptoms outweigh the risks, which can be mitigated by factors like age and dosage. This potential change could shift public perception and increase access to what is considered the most effective treatment for menopause symptoms.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded $13.6 million to five women who were sexually assaulted by their English teacher, Garry Poe, at Rolling Hills High School in the 1980s. The verdict found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent for failing to prevent the abuse, which primarily occurred during unsupervised European trips Poe chaperoned after students graduated. The women testified that Poe groomed them on campus before assaulting them on the trips. The case highlights the long-lasting trauma experienced by the victims and holds the school district accountable for its failure to protect students from a predatory teacher.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new compensation package for Elon Musk that could be worth approximately $900 billion, potentially making him the world's first trillionaire. The plan is contingent on Musk leading the company to an $8.5 trillion valuation and meeting specific operational goals. This proposal comes as Musk's attention appears divided among his various companies and political activities. The board's rationale suggests that Musk's personal involvement is crucial to maintaining Tesla's high valuation, framing the massive payout as an incentive to secure his continued focus and leadership for the company's future growth.</p>

Mahmood responded firmly, stating that "no-one gets to mess with British democracy," whether they are a hostile state or a billionaire. The incident has drawn widespread criticism from UK political figures, who have labeled Musk's language as dangerous, irresponsible, and inflammatory.</p>

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has sharply criticized the club's recent performance, attributing its poor start to the season to a flawed summer transfer strategy and a lack of quality players suited to manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. Despite a £200 million investment in forwards, the team has struggled to score, leading to its worst league start in over three decades. Scholes argues that the club failed to prioritize a crucial midfield player and a top-tier goalkeeper. While senior officials reportedly still back Amorim, Scholes believes significant changes are needed to reverse the team's fortunes.</p>

The outbreak resulted in 10 deaths and a massive recall of deli products, with federal officials blaming systemic failures at the plant.

          <p>Despite its immense wealth, California now shares the highest poverty rate in the nation with Louisiana, at 17.7%, according to a new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. The report from the California Budget and Policy Center indicates that seven million Californians lack the resources to meet basic needs, largely driven by the state's steep housing costs. This marks a significant increase from a historic low in 2021, when expanded public benefits during the pandemic temporarily reduced poverty. The expiration of these support policies has reversed progress, with Black and Latino populations experiencing the most significant impact.</p>

This new law aims to rectify these issues by creating a legal "duty of candour" for officials and ensuring parity of funding for legal representation.
