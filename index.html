          <p>In a recent televised interview, former U.S. President Donald Trump stated he was unsure if individuals in the United States were entitled to due process under the law, and that he does not know if he must uphold the Constitution. Trump also dismissed the possibility of seeking a third term in office, despite prior suggestions otherwise. He addressed concerns about aggressive deportation policies, citing the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported, whom Trump claimed was a gang member without providing evidence. The article also touches on Trump's stance on annexing Canada, stating military action is "highly unlikely".</p>

          <p>A Patriot air-defense system is being transferred from Israel to Ukraine after refurbishment, with Western allies exploring options for Germany or Greece to contribute another system, according to U.S. officials. This delivery comes as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine, including a deadly missile strike on Kyiv. Despite mixed public remarks, President Trump has softened his stance on Ukraine, engaging in cordial discussions with President Zelensky and approving a minerals deal to facilitate further U.S. military aid. The transfer of Patriot systems, which are scarce and require U.S. approval, aims to bolster Ukraine's defenses, particularly around Kyiv.</p>

Whiplashing court orders have left probationary workers in a fragile state of limbo, some rehired, others on administrative leave, and some fired again after Supreme Court intervention. The administration's actions have been criticized as a "sham" and a "Project 2025 operation to gut the federal workforce." The mass firings have disrupted government functions and services, raising alarms about the loss of scientific and technical expertise.</p>

          <p>President Trump, when questioned about the need to uphold the Constitution, responded, "I don't know," but added that his lawyers will follow the Supreme Court's guidance. The response came after questions about due process for people in the U.S. Trump also reiterated his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. During the interview, Trump ruled out running for a third term and complimented Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors. He blamed former President Joe Biden for the "bad parts" of the economy.</p>

The move separates the town from Cameron Country, which previously rejected plans to build more housing for SpaceX employees. The newly named Starbase covers some 3.75 square kilometers near the SpaceX plant manufacturing the Starship rocket. The changed city status allows Starbase to control building and permitting processes and avoid other regulatory red-tape, while collecting taxes and writing local law.</p>

Carmen Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, joined a rally against the construction of the complex. Within 48 hours, her elderly aunt and uncle were arrested in Hong Kong and questioned about her activities. Ms. Lau believes police used the information they obtained to arrest another aunt a week later. The activist claimed the harassment was an attempt by officials to stop her “anti-Chinese” activities in the UK.</p>

The book delves into the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 biopic "Malcolm X," which dramatized Malcolm Little's transformation from a street hustler to a civil rights leader. Whitaker explores how Malcolm's message of self-defense, Black pride, and cultural assertion continues to resonate in today's fractious politics.

          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly damaging to relationships. The phrase communicates that the person is not enough and someone else could do a better job as a partner. This can lead to insecurity issues and questioning of worth. The phrase is often a symptom of a deeper dysfunction: the fear of openly speaking up about needs. Happiness in a relationship can only be achieved when we communicate what we need clearly, without shame or comparison.</p>
