          <p>Three deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were killed in an explosion at a law enforcement training facility. The incident, which occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, is under a multi-agency investigation including the ATF and FBI. Officials believe the deputies, who were experts on the Arson Explosives Detail, were attempting to render safe a grenade recovered from a separate location when it detonated. This event represents the largest single loss of life for the department since 1857, prompting condolences from local, state, and federal officials.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that approximately two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority still view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These positive sentiments towards space exploration are consistent across various political and ideological demographics, suggesting broad public backing for future missions.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global artificial intelligence landscape by championing open-source AI models. Unlike the closed systems of U.S. giants such as OpenAI and Google, these Chinese firms make their source code and model weights publicly available, fostering collaborative development worldwide. The recent launch of powerful and free-to-use models from DeepSeek has been particularly disruptive, presenting a significant challenge to American dominance in the field. This trend has not only spurred a wave of AI applications within China but also provides a viable, accessible alternative for international developers.</p>

The clip showed a man and a woman, rumored to be company executives, embracing before abruptly hiding their faces from the concert's large screen camera. This sparked widespread online speculation about an affair, fueled by a comment from Coldplay's lead singer. In response to the internet furor, Astronomer announced a formal investigation into the matter and appointed a co-founder as interim CEO, emphasizing its commitment to leadership conduct and accountability.</p>

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is critically understaffed, hindering its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The report cited a 32% vacancy rate in the last fiscal year, leading to the closure of cases without proper on-site inspections and insufficient documentation when inspections did occur. Labor groups and safety experts argue this chronic understaffing puts workers at risk, especially as climate change introduces new hazards like extreme heat. While Cal/OSHA states it has recently reduced its vacancy rate and is working to improve operations, critics insist more significant investment is needed.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which reportedly included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, calling the story "false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS." The lawsuit names Murdoch, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson, and the two reporters as defendants, accusing them of major journalistic failures. A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's publisher, stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Actor Kate Beckinsale is mourning the death of her mother, veteran British actor Judy Loe, who passed away at age 78. In an emotional social media post, Beckinsale called her mother the "compass of my life" and revealed she died after a period of "immeasurable suffering." Loe had a prolific career, primarily in British television, with notable roles in series like "Ace of Wands" and "Singles." She was married to actor Richard Beckinsale, Kate's father, until his death in 1979, and later to director Roy Battersby. Beckinsale praised her mother's huge heart and courage, particularly in her final year.</p>

          <p>In a bizarre case, a 21-year-old IT expert has been charged with the murder of a 75-year-old real estate professional whose disappearance he was initially helping police investigate. Authorities in Madera County, California, arrested Audrik Matevosian for the killing of Robert Boyajian, who was found dead in a Mojave Desert cave. Investigators first approached Matevosian to access security footage at the victim's home, but later identified him in ATM surveillance footage using the victim's card. After his arrest, Matevosian confessed to the killing, which authorities believe was financially motivated, and led them to the body.</p>

          <p>The 'California Forever' project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires, has announced plans for a large-scale manufacturing hub within its proposed new city in Solano County. The 2,100-acre "Solano Foundry" aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other high-tech industries, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. This proposal follows an earlier plan for a shipbuilding hub and aligns with a broader push to revitalize American industry. While project leaders tout the creation of thousands of jobs and new homes, the controversial development continues to face skepticism from local community groups.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a homeless man who was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment clearing, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta. The lawsuit alleges that city employees acted negligently by failing to check if tents were occupied before using heavy machinery to clear the site near Ebenezer Baptist Church. Taylor's death, which sparked outrage among advocates, is described as "tragic and preventable." The family is seeking unspecified damages and hopes the lawsuit will prompt the city to treat its homeless population with more dignity and respect, especially as sweeps continue ahead of the FIFA World Cup.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has revised its internal practices to prevent engineers based in China from providing technical support for the company's U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The change is a direct response to national security concerns highlighted in a recent ProPublica report, which detailed the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese engineers managed by U.S.-based "digital escorts." This arrangement was seen as a potential cybersecurity vulnerability. The Defense Department called the old system "unacceptable" and announced a review, while Microsoft affirmed its commitment to providing secure services to the U.S. government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK are reporting a significant increase in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a warm and dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in gardens and farm landscapes. The common wasp appears to be thriving, bucking the trend of widespread decline seen in many other insect populations. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them from picnic areas with a small offering of something sweet placed a short distance away.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep-seated reasons why the Jeffrey Epstein case has become a central issue for many of President Trump's supporters. For this base, the case is not just about one man's crimes but is seen as a symbol of a corrupt, so-called "deep state" elite that controls government and other institutions. The narrative is intertwined with long-running conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, which posit that a global cabal is involved in child trafficking. The administration's handling of the Epstein files has created a political challenge, as it struggles to satisfy a base animated by these powerful and persistent conspiratorial beliefs.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the comedic musical is loosely based on a tabloid story from 2004 about Coleen's allegedly discarded engagement ring. The show's creators stress that it is an affectionate homage rather than a malicious parody, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have endured intense public scrutiny. The play is characteristic of the Royal Court theatre's focus on original, locally relevant comedies.</p>

RSV is a highly infectious virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, and it is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children.

The girl had been abducted by seven men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased the men away and then stood guard over the girl until she was found. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, which could explain why the lions protected her instead of attacking.</p>

          <p>The unexpected cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by CBS is raising significant questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. This article explores the multiple pressures facing these programs, including shrinking audiences, declining advertising revenue, and competition from social media clips and podcasts. While CBS cited financial reasons, the timing—days after Colbert criticized a settlement between parent company Paramount and President Trump—has fueled speculation about political motives. The move highlights a broader industry shift, as younger viewers abandon linear TV and the cultural dominance of late-night hosts wanes in a fragmented media landscape.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a certain faulty gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria over-activates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain why the disease behaves differently among patients and why some treatments are ineffective. The research opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that could target this specific inflammatory pathway, moving closer to precision medicine for inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

          <p>The general manager of Boise State Public Radio, Tom Michael, discussed the severe impact that the Trump administration's plan to cut all federal funding for public broadcasting will have on rural communities. Michael explained that his station is set to lose about 20% of its budget, which will inevitably lead to a loss of services, programs, or staff. He emphasized that in a mountainous, low-population state like Idaho, federal funding has been crucial for building the infrastructure needed to reach remote areas, which are often news deserts. The cuts threaten a vital lifeline of real-time information, such as wildfire alerts, for these communities.</p>
