        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-controlled legislatures in Utah and Idaho passing bans on flying pride flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds. Salt Lake City adopted three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, the trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag into the city's traditional design. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag, after the Idaho legislature restricted allowable flags to a limited list. These actions highlight the ongoing tension between conservative efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ rights and local governments' attempts to affirm diversity and inclusion.</p>

          <p>Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan following Indian missile strikes in Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, which India claims targeted militant infrastructure. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation, with air raid sirens sounding across India as part of preparedness exercises.

          <p>During a House committee hearing, leaders from Haverford College, DePaul University, and California Polytechnic State University apologized for their institutions' responses to antisemitism on campus, particularly following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The hearing echoed previous sessions that led to resignations at Penn and Harvard, with Republicans threatening to withhold federal funding from uncooperative schools. Democratic representatives accused Republicans of using antisemitism as a political tool, while university leaders attempted to balance contrition with academic freedom. The article notes that many universities have tightened protest rules and issued harsher punishments, potentially explaining the reduced protest activity this spring.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is facing a lawsuit from investors who allege the company misled them by withholding information about the backlash following the death of CEO Brian Thompson and an earlier Senate report. The lawsuit claims UnitedHealth artificially inflated stock prices by initially forecasting high earnings per share, despite growing controversy over its claims denial rates and the public's reaction to Thompson's death. The company later cut its profit forecast, leading to a significant drop in its stock price. Investors are seeking damages for losses incurred between December 2024 and April 2025.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering deporting migrants to Libya, a country plagued by political turmoil and armed conflict, according to U.S. officials. These deportations, potentially operated by the U.S. military, are part of a broader effort to deter illegal immigration by forging deportation agreements with various countries. Libya has a Level 4 travel advisory due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest, and has faced criticism for its treatment of migrants, who often endure brutal conditions in detention centers. It remains unclear who would be deported and whether they would be detained upon arrival.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as it assesses the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed signaled rising economic risks, with concerns that Trump's tariffs could spur higher inflation and unemployment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has dropped, the tariffs' impact hasn't yet materialized in economic data. The central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, retaining flexibility to adjust rates based on economic developments.</p>
