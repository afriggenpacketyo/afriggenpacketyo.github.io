          <p>A state banquet held at Windsor Castle for President Trump served as a major diplomatic showpiece, emphasizing hospitality to make the visiting leader feel valued. The guest list notably lacked Hollywood celebrities, instead featuring a heavy presence of political figures and technology executives like Apple's Tim Cook and OpenAI's Sam Altman. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales, with other prominent figures from UK and US politics, business, and sports also in attendance for the elaborate affair.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." In a social media post, he also recommended that individuals and organizations funding the group be thoroughly investigated. This move follows a similar, unfulfilled promise from his first term and comes in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, as Trump vows to address what he terms "radical left political violence." The legal implications and timing of the designation remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock declined after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and confirmed it was abandoning a recent rebranding effort. The company faced intense public backlash, including criticism from President Trump, over a new, modern logo that many customers felt was generic and soulless. In response to the criticism, CEO Julie Masino announced the company would revert to its classic "Old Timer" branding, suspend restaurant remodels, and refocus on enhancing the traditional guest experience.</p>

          <p>Speaking at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun delivered a speech calling for greater global unity while warning against a world dominated by hegemony and Cold War thinking. In what was interpreted as a veiled critique of the United States, he cautioned that military interference and coercing nations to take sides would lead to chaos and disorder. His remarks reflect China's ongoing diplomatic messaging against perceived US influence amid rising tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>The price for a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) in Singapore, which grants the right to own a vehicle for ten years, has soared to a new record high. In the latest bidding exercise, the premium for Category A cars, which includes smaller vehicles, jumped to S$119,003. This significant increase is believed to be driven by heightened demand following a government announcement that rebates for purchasing electric vehicles will be reduced starting in 2026, prompting buyers to act sooner.

          <p>According to a new report, California's poverty rate remains the highest in the nation, a position it shares with Louisiana. The analysis from the California Budget and Policy Center found that in 2024, about 17.7% of the state's residents could not afford their basic needs. This figure represents a significant increase from a historic low of 11% in 2021, with the report attributing the sharp rise to the expiration of effective pandemic-era anti-poverty policies like the expanded federal child tax credit.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent 0.25% interest rate cut is unlikely to satisfy President Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the central bank for more aggressive action. This article analyzes the administration's sustained campaign to influence the Fed, including the attempt to oust board member Lisa Cook and the controversial appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a White House economic adviser. While the Fed has so far maintained its institutional independence, Trump's persistent attacks continue to test its commitment to making policy free from political interference.

The decision on borrowing costs will be announced after the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to lower its own rates, highlighting the different economic challenges and inflationary pressures facing the two nations.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's 0.25% interest rate reduction, CNBC's Jim Cramer cautioned investors against making significant portfolio adjustments based on the decision alone. He argued that the cut was widely anticipated and does not fundamentally change the major themes driving the market, such as the ongoing strength in technology and AI stocks. Cramer suggested the market's subdued reaction indicates that the Fed's prudent, steady approach was ultimately what the economy required, despite some investors hoping for more dramatic action.
