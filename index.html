          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, falling short of his 2021 world record but comfortably beating the defending champion. On the women's side, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory, though she also finished below her own record-setting pace from the prior year. The event marks a triumphant return for Chestnut to the iconic Fourth of July competition in Coney Island.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are examining the physiological impacts of competitive eating, spurred by events like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. While long-term effects are not well-documented, concerns include permanent stomach stretching, impaired gastric emptying, and risks from consuming massive amounts of sodium and fat. A 2007 study highlighted how a competitive eater's stomach can expand dramatically, unlike a normal person's. Although the body can often regulate itself after a single event, immediate dangers like choking or esophageal tears remain significant risks for competitors.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California, named the Madre Fire, has rapidly expanded to over 52,500 acres, establishing it as the largest blaze in the state for 2025. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the fire has triggered evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With 10% containment, the fire threatens 50 structures, though no injuries or damages have been reported yet. State and federal agencies are operating in a unified command, deploying extensive air and ground resources to combat the exponential growth.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. The announcement follows former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's decision to quit the party to co-found the new entity with Corbyn, a move he praised as principled. The new party aims to provide an alternative to the current Labour government and the Conservative party, building on a small alliance of independent pro-Gaza MPs. While some on the left have praised the move, it is not yet clear which other prominent figures will join.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which originates from a Shakespearean character, is a long-standing trope associated with Jewish moneylenders and greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," highlighting how it reinforces harmful conspiracies. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he only understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint detailing a scam where perpetrators impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency. The scammers used deceptive email addresses, substituting a lowercase 'l' for an 'i', to trick victims into sending donations. The complaint states that a victim believed they were contributing to the official committee when they transferred the funds. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds that have been recovered from a Binance account.</p>

Trump expressed disappointment after his call with Putin yielded no progress, while Zelenskyy described his own conversation with Trump as "important and useful," focusing on bolstering Ukraine's air defenses.

With surveys suggesting a high percentage of students use AI for coursework, educators are finding it difficult to detect AI-generated content, prompting a return to in-person, handwritten tests. Institutions like Texas A&M and UC Berkeley report a rising demand for "blue book" exam booklets as a way to ensure academic integrity.

          <p>Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling. The lawsuit claims agents are targeting individuals based on their appearance, particularly in raids on known hubs for Latino workers, and making arrests without reasonable suspicion. Advocates argue that the Trump administration's daily arrest quotas are pressuring agents to cut corners, leading to unconstitutional seizures. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, stating that its enforcement operations are highly targeted and not based on race.</p>

          <p>While Germany's defense industry is booming following a significant increase in military spending, economists are skeptical about its broader economic benefits. A study by University of Mannheim professors suggests that for every euro the government spends on defense, it may only generate 50 cents of additional economic activity. In contrast, investments in infrastructure or education could yield much higher returns. Critics argue that the spending primarily boosts arms companies' profits rather than Germany's overall defense capabilities or economic growth, as military hardware does not create additional economic value after production.

          <p>In a Fourth of July post on the social media platform X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated he feels "politically homeless," criticizing the Democratic party for moving away from what he sees as a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. A self-described "techno-capitalist," Altman argued for policies that both encourage wealth creation and ensure its wide distribution, a balance he believes Democrats no longer champion. He expressed a preference for candidates focused on raising everyone's standard of living rather than on eliminating billionaires. His comments appeared to be a response to a New York City mayoral candidate's recent remarks against the existence of billionaires.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new trade agreements are not finalized, a baseline 10% duty on all imports could be supplemented by much higher country-specific "reciprocal rates." While the Trump administration has announced deals with nations like China and the U.K., the status of dozens of others remains unresolved. Economists warn the new duties could fuel inflation, harm smaller companies, and dent financial markets as the deadline nears. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton secured his place in the third round of Wimbledon with a rapid-fire 70-second conclusion to his match against Rinky Hijikata. The match had been controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light, with Shelton just about to serve for the win. Upon resumption, he served three aces and an unreturnable serve to quickly end the contest. Shelton later explained that the umpire had cited the impending shutdown of the Hawk-Eye line-calling system as the reason for the previous night's suspension, a decision that had initially frustrated him.</p>

The move is a direct response to Vietnam becoming a major hub for Chinese manufacturers seeking to bypass U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Pop Mart, the maker of the popular Labubu dolls, is facing potential headwinds after Chinese state media called for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, a model central to the company's success. An editorial warned against businesses enticing young children into heavy spending on mystery toys, echoing past crackdowns on the video game industry. However, analysts believe Pop Mart may be insulated from the most severe impacts, as its primary demographic is young adults, not children. The company's significant and growing overseas sales are also expected to cushion it from potential domestic regulatory pressures.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's government in Afghanistan since the group seized power in 2021. The move, which involved Moscow removing the Taliban from its list of outlawed organizations, was finalized when Russia's Foreign Ministry accepted credentials from a new Afghan ambassador. China welcomed the decision, stating Afghanistan should not be excluded from the international community. The recognition provides a degree of legitimacy to the Taliban regime, which has been largely isolated on the world stage due to its severe restrictions on the rights of women and girls.</p>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the British imposition of martial law on Boston in the 1770s and the modern-day deployment of troops in American cities. The author argues that it was not the initial taxes but the escalating military presence under the Coercive Acts of 1774 that transformed colonial resistance into a full-scale revolution. The piece highlights how the Declaration of Independence explicitly condemned keeping standing armies among civilians. It serves as a historical caution that using military force to handle domestic unrest can provoke tension, fear, and unintended, escalating violence.</p>

The expert pointed to the "Wuhan model," where second-tier cities have created integrated university-industry clusters focused on advanced manufacturing, as a potential blueprint for American economic revival. This analysis comes after a 10-day trip to China's tech hubs and amid a temporary de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
