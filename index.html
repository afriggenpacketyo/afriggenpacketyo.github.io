          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren's office has released a report detailing alleged ethical violations and conflicts of interest by Elon Musk during his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The report claims Musk used his position as a "special government employee" to benefit himself and his businesses, citing over 100 instances of questionable actions. The report accuses Musk of violating ethical norms at an alarming rate, raising concerns about corruption and potential conflicts of interest during his time in the Trump administration.

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, has resigned from her role overseeing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Her resignation follows an order from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to update the agency's guidance, which she felt compromised her ability to help vulnerable populations. Kennedy's directive included excluding pregnant women from the vaccine recommendations, a move that contradicted expert advice on the increased risk of severe COVID-19 for this group. The incident has sparked criticism from other health officials, with one suggesting more resignations should follow in protest of the Secretary's actions. Optimism score is not applicable here.</p>

          <p>Pornhub, along with RedTube and YouPorn, has blocked access to its sites in France to protest new regulations requiring age verification for users. The new law mandates that explicit websites verify users are 18 or older using methods like credit cards or government-issued IDs, employing a double anonymity system to protect user identities. Aylo, the parent company, argues that age verification should occur on devices rather than websites, citing privacy concerns and ineffectiveness. The French government defends the law as necessary to protect minors, noting that millions of minors in France access porn websites monthly. Optimism score is not applicable here.</p>

Some Trump allies have criticized Barrett as "weak," while Trump seeks to nominate judges in the mold of Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia. Despite the reported frustration, Trump has not publicly attacked Barrett and defended her after she sided with liberal justices in a case. Optimism score is not applicable here.</p>
