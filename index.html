While prioritizing trade talks with the US, she emphasized that strengthening trade relationships with the EU remains a key priority for the UK government, as the UK prepares for a summit with the EU in May to improve relations.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales saw their largest increase in nearly four years, with a 1.6% rise between January and March, driven by warmer weather in March boosting sales in garden centers, clothing, and DIY goods. However, food sales volumes decreased, particularly in supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that consumer confidence dipped in April, potentially leading to weaker sales in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Konstantin Borisov, Ph.D., has controversially claimed that the biblical Garden of Eden was located near the Great Pyramid of Giza, citing biblical texts and medieval maps. He argues that the Gihon River mentioned in the Bible is actually the Nile and that the Great Pyramid was built near the Tree of Eternal Life. Borisov references a simulation showing an electric field inside the King's chamber resembling a tree-like pattern, suggesting the pyramid's unique ability to produce such an image. Most biblical scholars place the Garden of Eden in the region of modern-day Iraq.</p>
