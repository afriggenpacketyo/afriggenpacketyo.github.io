          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite a 5.1% year-on-year increase, sales fell short of analysts' expectations, while industrial output exceeded forecasts, indicating resilience against U.S. tariffs. The National Bureau of Statistics cautioned about external uncertainties, emphasizing the need to consolidate economic recovery efforts. Fixed-asset investment saw a slight increase, while the urban unemployment rate eased. The article highlights the mixed economic signals coming out of China amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., and the efforts to diversify exports to mitigate the impact of tariffs.

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Kyle Chan argues that China is outpacing the United States in technology and manufacturing due to strategic investments and long-term planning, while the Trump administration focuses on short-sighted trade wars and undermines American innovation. China leads in multiple industries, including steel, electric vehicles, and 5G equipment, and is projected to dominate global manufacturing by 2030. Beijing's focus on cutting-edge technologies, supported by substantial venture capital and research funding, contrasts sharply with Trump's tariffs and cuts to research funding, potentially leading to a Chinese-dominated world. The article suggests that the U.S. needs to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid a diminished future.</p>

          <p>A downgrade by Moody's of the United States' credit rating, coupled with growing concerns about government debt, is causing turmoil in financial markets. The downgrade reflects worries about President Trump's policies and the health of the U.S. economy, particularly a bill in Congress that would make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. The downgrade has led to declines in stock futures, weakened the U.S. dollar, and increased Treasury bond yields, raising fears about the safe-haven status of U.S. debt. The article discusses how this downgrade could trigger broader concerns about fiscal spending and interest rates in other countries as well.</p>

          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India, aiming for the country to play a major role in supplying the US market. CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the US will originate from India, with Vietnam producing iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods. This move is designed to mitigate the impact of US tariffs on Apple's supply chains. While this shift presents a big opportunity for India, challenges remain, including cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and supply chain vulnerabilities, requiring careful policy considerations to maximize gains.

          <p>An ongoing corruption investigation involving staff and ex-staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has led to multiple detentions and probes across several countries. The investigation centers on possible irregularities in contracts awarded for ammunition and drones, with indications of information being passed to defense contractors and money laundering through consultancy companies. This probe serves as a 'precious reminder' of the importance of oversight in defense spending, particularly as NATO countries increase their military budgets amid the war in Ukraine. The article discusses the potential for corruption in the defense sector due to secrecy, large sums of money, and sensitive negotiations.</p>

          <p>House Budget Committee revived President Trump’s stalled bill to cut taxes and spending, after fiscally conservative Republicans relented and allowed it to advance even as they continued to press for deeper reductions to health and environmental programs. The vote signaled a temporary resolution to a revolt from a group of hard-liners on the panel, who on Friday joined Democrats in opposing the bill in committee, tanking it over concerns that it did not do enough to rein in the nation’s ballooning debt. The bill would make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, fulfilling the president’s campaign promise.</p>

Investigators are examining Bartkus' online posts and writings, seeking public assistance to fill gaps in their investigation. The father recalls his son's childhood fascination with how things worked but expresses disbelief at his involvement in such a violent act, which federal investigators are treating as an international act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a key hurdle in the House after conservatives initially opposed it over concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to some 'minor modifications,' and the bill advanced with four conservatives voting present. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term, while increasing spending on the military and border security, offset partly by cuts to Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. Despite this progress, the bill still faces challenges in the Rules Committee and potential opposition from both conservatives and moderates, as well as obstacles in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers in fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of its booming inbound tourism sector. The government aims to boost tourism to 60 million visitors by 2030. Travelers from countries with visa exemptions will be required to provide personal and travel information in advance, allowing the Immigration Services Agency to examine data for criminal history or illegal stays. This system, modeled after the US ESTA, aims to streamline immigration processes and enhance security, while utilizing digital technologies to eliminate in-person procedures.</p>

The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, will end with the resumption of service, benefiting hundreds of thousands of commuters. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, reflects concessions made by both sides. While the deal is finalized, NJ Transit needs 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment, ensuring the safety of riders before full service restarts.</p>

          <p>The dragon’s blood tree, found only on the Yemeni island of Socotra, is struggling to survive due to intensifying threats from climate change. Increasingly severe cyclones, grazing by invasive goats, and persistent turmoil in Yemen are pushing the species, and the unique ecosystem it supports, toward collapse. The island receives about 5,000 tourists annually, many drawn by the surreal sight of the dragon’s blood forests, which are important for the economy of the island.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was diagnosed on Friday with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis is serious, as it is Stage 4, which means it has spread. But the good news, prostate cancer specialists said, is that recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have changed what was once an exceedingly grim picture for men with advanced disease. Dr. Judd Moul, a prostate cancer expert at Duke University, said that men whose prostate cancer has spread to their bones, “can live 5, 7, 10 or more years” with current treatments. The article highlights how the federal research money, with Mr. Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, in large part led to this progress.</p>
