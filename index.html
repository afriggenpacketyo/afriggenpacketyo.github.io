The Trump administration's plan to accept the jet has raised security concerns among intelligence experts and lawmakers.

          <p>A federal court has blocked the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on various foreign nations, deeming them illegal and exceeding presidential authority.

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the homicide case against the medical team of the late football legend Diego Maradona. The ruling came after one of the court's judges recused herself due to ethical conflicts arising from her appearance in a television documentary about the case. Prosecutors argued that the judge's involvement created a conflict that tainted the trial. A new trial will be held with a different panel of judges, but the date has not been specified.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer criticized a Wall Street downgrade of Starbucks, arguing that the turnaround under CEO Brian Niccol will be successful despite concerns about declining sales and operational issues. TD Cowen downgraded Starbucks to hold, citing labor investments and deteriorating value perceptions. Cramer highlighted Niccol's track record of rescuing Chipotle from a reputational crisis, expressing confidence in his ability to address the challenges at Starbucks. Despite acknowledging that turnarounds take time, Cramer cautioned against trying to time the market and prefers to remain long on Starbucks. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SBUX.)

          <p>Mark Gordon, currently on trial with Constance Marten for manslaughter, was previously convicted of sexual offences, including sexual assault, in Florida in 1989. The details of his prior offences were read to the jury at a retrial of separate charges at the Old Bailey in London. The jury also heard that on three occasions Marten's family commissioned private investigators to conduct surveillance on the couple. Gordon was sentenced in the US to 40 years in prison, of which he served 22 years.</p>
