          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for U.S. President Donald Trump's four-day private visit. He arrived at his Turnberry golf resort, where he played a round of golf amid a heavy police and military presence, including road closures and aerial surveillance. The visit, which includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, has drawn several hundred protesters in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Concerns have been raised by police representatives about the substantial cost and staffing impact of the security detail required for the president's stay.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking direct equity stakes in private companies at a scale not typically seen outside of major crises, marking a significant policy shift for the Republican party. This includes President Trump personally holding a "golden share" in U.S. Steel following its merger with Nippon Steel and the Pentagon purchasing a $400 million stake in rare-earth miner MP Materials. Experts suggest this interventionist approach, justified by national security concerns and competition with China, expands state involvement in the market in an unprecedented manner. These actions are reshaping the relationship between the government and industries deemed critical to the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

Hershey Medical Center, the child was pronounced dead. The CEO of Hershey Entertainment & Resorts expressed deep condolences to the family, stating the park will conduct a thorough internal review and cooperate with authorities.

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, according to hospital officials. A majority of the victims were reportedly shot while waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing, while others were killed in strikes on residential buildings. This violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled and concerns about famine in the region intensify. The United Nations and aid organizations continue to report severe difficulties in distributing humanitarian supplies due to Israeli military restrictions and ongoing hostilities, increasing international pressure for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Early results from an unprecedented "Great Recall" vote in Taiwan suggest that all targeted lawmakers, primarily from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, will keep their seats. The recall was initiated by a civic movement accusing the legislators of being overly sympathetic to China and obstructing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government. The outcome means the opposition will maintain its majority in the legislature, at least until another round of recall votes in August. The event has highlighted deep political polarization in Taiwan, with both sides accusing the other of undermining democracy.</p>

          <p>In this personal opinion piece, American comedian Krystal Evans, who resides in Scotland, shares her feelings about Donald Trump's visit to the country. She explains that she avoids discussing Trump in her comedy because his presence is a constant, unwelcome reminder of a reality she sought to distance herself from by moving abroad. Evans reflects on Trump's desire for Scottish acceptance, contrasting it with the genuine connection she feels to her adopted home. The article uses humor and personal anecdotes to critique the visit, concluding that despite his maternal heritage, Trump's character is fundamentally at odds with Scottish identity.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Columbia University's agreement with the Trump administration represents a dangerous capitulation that undermines academic independence. To restore federal research funding, the university agreed to a $200 million fine and concessions, including allowing a Trump-approved monitor to review admissions and the Middle Eastern studies department. The author frames this as an "extortion scheme" that sets a precedent for government overreach into private institutions, using financial leverage to enforce political agendas. The piece suggests this marks the beginning of a dark era where universities sacrifice integrity and freedom to appease governmental pressure.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has prompted questions about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some view it as a one-off financial decision by Paramount, others see it as a sign of a broader decline due to shifting viewer habits and rising production costs. The article notes that late-night shows are expensive to produce and face declining linear TV ad revenue and ratings, even as they generate significant online engagement. The future of other shows, like "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026, will be a key indicator of the genre's direction in the evolving media landscape.</p>

Roth contends that by targeting high-profile universities, the Trump administration seeks to delegitimize institutions that derive authority independent of White House ideology, similar to attacks on the press and legal system. He suggests the strategy is to create a chilling effect, causing academics to self-censor and align with those in power. While acknowledging universities have problems like ideological narrowness, Roth asserts the current assault is an orchestrated campaign against intellectual freedom itself.</p>

Animal welfare experts highlight that keeping primates as pets leads to immense suffering, as the animals are often poached from the wild, a process that involves killing adult monkeys to capture their infants. These rescued primates, like a spider monkey named Violeta at the Oakland Zoo, often suffer from severe trauma, malnutrition, and psychological damage. The bill, currently in a House committee, is seen by a coalition of zoos and animal welfare groups as a crucial step to protect these animals.</p>

While rooted in disputes over land and resources, the violence has been exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and a breakdown of traditional conflict resolution.

          <h2>Family That Fled Violence in Mexico Describes Losing Everything After Self-Deporting from the U.S.</h2>

          <p>This article recounts the story of Sonia Coria and Carlos Leon, who self-deported from Arizona to Mexico with their two children out of fear following Donald Trump's election victory. After building a modest life in the U.S. while their asylum case was pending, they decided to leave, worried they would lose what little they had. Upon crossing back into Mexico, their truck and entire life savings of $5,000 were confiscated by Mexican customs officials. The family's experience illustrates the difficult choices facing immigrants and the devastating consequences that can result from the decision to self-deport, a strategy the Trump administration is actively encouraging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, the only hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is facing a potential closure due to long-standing financial struggles. A new bill championed by the Trump administration, which mandates the largest funding reduction in Medicaid's history, poses an even greater threat to its survival. The hospital relies on Medicaid and Medicare for about 80% of its revenue, and administrators fear the cuts will be devastating for a community already suffering from poverty and a lack of resources. The situation highlights a national crisis for rural healthcare, where the loss of a single hospital can cripple a local economy and endanger residents' lives.</p>

          <p>This column pays tribute to actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, arguing that his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show" carried a significant cultural weight for the Black community. The author reflects on how Theo, alongside other key television characters from his youth, provided a relatable and positive representation of Black boyhood and family life that was rare on television at the time. The piece contends that by portraying a character from a successful, supportive Black family, Warner helped redefine mainstream perceptions of Blackness. The author concludes that the community's gratitude stems from recognizing the burden he carried in representing so much for so many.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author, who is deaf, reflects on growing up as part of the "ADA generation" and how the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 shaped her life. She describes how the law provided access to education and community, allowing her to thrive in ways that were once unimaginable. However, she now sees these hard-won rights as being under threat from the current administration, which has rolled back accessibility guidelines and made cuts to programs like Medicaid. The author calls on her generation to move from taking the ADA for granted to actively fighting to preserve and expand its protections for the future.</p>

          <p>Afghans who relocated to California are in a state of desperation following the Trump administration's termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for their country. This move, combined with a travel ban and the suspension of refugee programs, has left thousands vulnerable to deportation and shattered hopes for family reunification. Advocacy groups say many Afghans who assisted the U.S. military are now at risk, as their primary legal protection is gone while applications for asylum or Special Immigrant Visas are stuck in severe backlogs. The policy changes have created immense fear and uncertainty within California's large Afghan community, the biggest in the nation.</p>

The estimated cost for the "voluntary seismic upgrades" on the 52-story downtown skyscraper is over $230 million. County officials state the building is currently safe and up-to-code, describing the work as a proactive measure for the future and still far cheaper than retrofitting the current, seismically vulnerable Hall of Administration. However, the revelation of the high upgrade costs has drawn criticism from Supervisor Janice Hahn, who opposed the purchase and called it a "boondoggle."</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals a significant increase in advanced liver disease among heavy drinkers in the U.S. over the past two decades. The research, which analyzed national health data, found that the share of heavy drinkers with significant liver scarring more than doubled, from 1.8% to 4.3%, even without an increase in the overall amount of alcohol being consumed. Researchers suggest the changing health profile of drinkers, with higher rates of obesity and diabetes, is a major contributing factor. The increase was particularly pronounced in women, older individuals, and people with metabolic syndrome, highlighting a growing public health concern.</p>

The piece connects this messaging to the "Heritage American" movement, which prioritizes citizens with multi-generational roots over recent immigrants. The columnist concludes that this is not a subtle message but a clear road map for an administration "hell-bent on turning back the clock."</p>

          <p>A large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on Glass House Brands, one of California's largest licensed cannabis operators, has sent shockwaves through the legal cannabis industry. The raid, which resulted in the detention of 361 people and the death of a worker who fell while trying to escape, has created confusion and fear about a potential federal crackdown. Because cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, the raid highlights the precarious position of state-licensed businesses and their workers, many of whom are undocumented.

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals a significant gap between the Trump administration's claim of targeting the "worst of the worst" criminals for deportation and the reality of who is being arrested. In the Los Angeles region, the proportion of arrested immigrants with no criminal conviction surged to 69% in June, a dramatic increase from 35% in April. This trend suggests that to meet aggressive arrest quotas, enforcement actions are sweeping up many non-criminal individuals, including garment workers and tamale vendors. Critics argue the administration focuses on a minority of violent offenders in its messaging to justify broader, less popular enforcement policies.</p>

This divergence highlights that companies less reliant on physical imports are insulated from the immediate effects of the trade taxes.

Advocates report that this strategy, aimed at meeting high arrest quotas, targets individuals for expedited removal, often stripping them of due process.
