          <h2>American Alcohol Consumption Declines to Record Low, Gallup Poll Indicates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, marking a record low since 1939. This decline is linked to increasing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation. Younger demographics, aged 18-34, show a particularly strong trend towards abstaining and perceiving moderate drinking as harmful. Experts suggest societal shifts, like the popularity of alcohol-free challenges and the cost of alcohol, also contribute to this generational change.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Virginia Tech have published a study showing that pet dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. This pest poses a significant threat to various plants and agriculture, prompting states to urge their eradication. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in outdoor, real-world conditions, outperforming human searches. This breakthrough offers a promising new method for controlling the spread of this destructive insect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that popular mousse-form sunscreens, including Supergoop!'s body mousse, may not provide adequate UV protection. The agency issued warning letters to five companies, citing a lack of required FDA approval for these products, which are classified as drugs. Additionally, the FDA expressed concern that the packaging, resembling whipped cream containers, increases the risk of accidental ingestion, particularly by children. Companies like Supergoop! are reportedly working to address these regulatory violations.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has ceased using Western industrial chips in its control systems due to growing security concerns. This move follows alarms over vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, exemplified by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus. The decision highlights China's strategic efforts to enhance national security by reducing reliance on foreign technology in critical infrastructure. This development underscores the increasing geopolitical tensions surrounding technological supply chains.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy media tycoon with British and Chinese citizenship, is in the final stages of his national security trial in Hong Kong, accused of colluding with foreign forces. Detained since December 2020, Lai faces a potential life sentence, with critics viewing his case as an example of Hong Kong's legal system being used to silence political opposition. Lai, a self-described "rebel" who fled mainland China, built a media empire and became a vocal critic of Beijing, advocating for the city's freedoms. His son and international figures are calling for his release, citing his declining health and the case's implications for China-UK relations.</p>

Biden, son of former President Joe Biden, alleged in an interview that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim attributed to author Michael Wolff. Melania Trump's lawyer stated that these remarks, widely disseminated, have caused "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." The move mirrors Donald Trump's strategy of aggressively pursuing litigation against critics, as the first lady maintains she was introduced to her husband by a modeling agent in 1998.</p>

          <p>Low-income Americans, like Angela Harmon in Dallas, face increasing difficulty affording air conditioning as energy costs rise, exacerbated by climate change. President Trump's proposed 2026 budget would eliminate LIHEAP, a federal utility assistance program, shifting responsibility to states. While the White House cites program fraud, critics warn this move will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. Research indicates climate change has significantly increased wholesale electricity costs across various U.S. regions, with these surges eventually passed on to consumers, making essential cooling less accessible for many.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Warn UK Cities Face New "Firewave" Risk Due to Climate Change</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK cities are increasingly vulnerable to "firewaves," a new phenomenon describing multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather, scientists warn. Researchers at Imperial College London coined the term, identifying that ten consecutive days of dry weather significantly heighten the risk, making vegetation highly flammable. Recent heath and gorse fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this emerging threat, once considered largely rural. While most fires are human-started, climate change creates more conducive conditions, prompting fire brigades to adopt proactive measures like drone technology and specialized vehicles.</p>

Trump expressed optimism for a "constructive" meeting and hinted at "very severe consequences" for Putin if no ceasefire is agreed upon.

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record-breaking glacier-related flooding from the Mendenhall River, which peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. The waters have since receded, and the immediate flood threat has ended, largely due to the effectiveness of newly installed "Hesco" barriers. This annual phenomenon, caused by water escaping Suicide Basin near the Mendenhall Glacier, has previously caused widespread damage and swept away homes.

          <p>President Trump has revoked a 2021 executive order issued by Joe Biden that sought to promote competition across the U.S. economy. Biden's initiative targeted anti-competitive practices in various sectors, from agriculture to labor, aiming to curb corporate abuses and excessive fees. The Justice Department welcomed Trump's move, advocating an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets. Critics argue that Trump's prior actions, including shrinking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have already cost Americans billions in higher fees and lost compensation, suggesting this revocation will further unwind consumer protections.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced a 20 billion reais ($5.5 billion) package to support exporters affected by U.S. tariffs of up to 50% imposed by President Trump. Trump justified the high levies by citing the legal situation of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, his ally, who faces coup allegations. Lula dismissed these reasons as baseless, asserting Brazil's independent judiciary and calling for negotiation over conflict. The package includes credit, tax charge postponements, and incentives for local production, aiming to mitigate the tariffs' economic impact.</p>

Researchers believe these benefits stem from medication's ability to reduce impulsive behavior and improve concentration.
