          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Beijing by train to join Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin for a military parade. The event marks the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. This gathering of the three leaders is viewed with concern by Western nations, who have accused North Korea and China of providing significant military and economic support for Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The meeting underscores a deepening alignment between the three countries in opposition to the U.S.-led global order, creating a significant geopolitical spectacle in the Chinese capital.</p>

          <p>Economists advising the Franco-German Council of Ministers have recommended that the European Union should concede defeat in the solar panel industry. The memos suggest that China's manufacturing capabilities are so far ahead that it is no longer viable for Europe to compete in this sector. French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry argued that unlike a dependency on gas, installed solar panels do not create an ongoing reliance, making it a strategic area where Europe can afford to admit it has lost the battle. This pragmatic advice highlights the scale of China's industrial advantage and urges a strategic reallocation of Europe's resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's National Intelligence Service estimates that approximately 2,000 North Korean soldiers deployed to support Russia have been killed in the war in Ukraine. This marks a significant increase from a previous estimate of 600 casualties in April. According to intelligence reports, Pyongyang has sent over 10,000 troops to Russia, primarily to the Kursk region, and is preparing to send 6,000 more. This development comes as the European Union plans to increase its military spending to a record €381 billion in 2025 to counter the threat posed by Russia, highlighting the escalating international dimensions of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Cast members from the second season of the reality dating show 'Love Is Blind UK' are reflecting on how their experiences were portrayed. Several participants claim that the show's editing exaggerated drama and omitted key vulnerable moments, creating a manufactured narrative for entertainment purposes. One couple, Megan and Kieran, who remain together, stated that their on-screen love triangle was overblown and that most of their deeper conversations happened off-camera. The article explores the inherent conflict between creating an entertaining television show and authentically capturing the complex process of forming genuine relationships under the intense pressure of the experiment.</p>

Furthermore, discussions about creating an SCO development bank signal a move toward an alternative financial system that reduces reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

This push is part of a broader effort by Beijing to reshape global historical memory, asserting China's significance in the anti-fascist war and, by extension, its legitimacy in the current international order.

          <p>An MIT Sloan School of Management professor predicts that residential electricity rates in the U.S. will continue to increase faster than the rate of inflation. This trend is attributed to the costs of updating an aging power grid and rising demand, partly from energy-intensive AI data centers. The article notes that while renewable energy sources like solar are becoming more affordable to produce, the phasing out of federal tax credits for solar installations is expected to exert further upward pressure on consumer electricity prices. Analysts anticipate this escalating cost trend will continue through at least 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Since launching sales in mid-July, Tesla has received just over 600 orders in India, a figure that has reportedly fallen short of the company's internal expectations. The electric vehicle manufacturer now plans to ship an initial batch of 350 to 500 cars from its Shanghai factory to India, with deliveries slated to begin in early September. Tesla's entry into the Indian market has been challenged by the country's high import tariffs on electric vehicles, a rudimentary charging infrastructure, and a market where EVs currently account for only 4% of total car sales.

          <p>A group of former Premier League players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, have revealed they lost tens of millions of pounds due to what they describe as "financial abuse" from their advisers. The players invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s, putting money into high-risk, unregulated film and property schemes. Many have since faced bankruptcy, lost their homes, and are now being pursued by HMRC for millions in unpaid taxes. The V11 campaign group, formed by the affected players, is now seeking legal changes to protect victims of financial crime from severe tax charges.</p>

          <p>The British pub industry is facing a severe crisis, with the British Beer and Pub Association estimating that one pub is set to close every day in 2025. A combination of rising costs—including increases to the minimum wage, National Insurance, and business rates—and reduced consumer spending is putting immense pressure on establishments. Many publicans have been forced to pass costs on to customers, pushing the average price of a pint over £5. Industry leaders are calling for urgent government action, such as cuts to VAT and business rates, to prevent further closures and protect thousands of jobs.</p>

This pivot is part of a broader industry evolution aimed at navigating trade frictions and maintaining profitability.

          <p>The Belgian government has announced its intention to officially recognize a Palestinian state during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. In addition, Belgium will impose a series of "firm sanctions" against Israel, including a ban on imports from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank and restrictions on certain Israeli officials. The country's foreign minister stated that these actions are intended to increase pressure on the Israeli government to respect international and humanitarian law amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

          <p>Pickleball is experiencing a massive surge in popularity in China, with online sales of paddles and related gear increasing more than six-fold over the past year.

This trend is creating significant business opportunities, with new for-profit courts being built and local sports associations systematizing tournament play. While the U.S. pickleball craze is well-established, China's market is in a period of strong acceleration, reflecting a new consumer focus on recreational sports.</p>

          <p>Utah's ambitious initiative to build 35,000 affordable starter homes within five years has seen slow progress, with only about 5,100 units built or started so far. Governor Spencer Cox has made the issue a priority to combat the state's severe housing shortage and record-high prices, which have pushed homeownership out of reach for many young families. While systemic changes to zoning laws have faced resistance, the article highlights one developer who is successfully using state incentives to build starter homes for under $400,000. This provides a potential model for addressing the crisis, though broader adoption remains a challenge.</p>

          <p>Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick's much-anticipated debut as the head coach of the University of North Carolina's football team ended in a blowout 48-14 loss to TCU. Despite an opening-drive touchdown that electrified the home crowd at Kenan Stadium, the Tar Heels were subsequently dominated. TCU scored 41 unanswered points, capitalizing on UNC turnovers, including a pick-six and a fumble returned for a touchdown. The lopsided result served as a stark "welcome to college football" moment for Belichick and indicates that the program has significant work to do under its new high-profile leader.</p>

          <p>A concerning report from New Jersey health officials has confirmed that ticks capable of transmitting Lyme disease have now been detected in all 21 counties across the state. This widespread presence signals an expanding public health threat, as the pests are moving from traditional wooded areas into more suburban and urban environments. Experts attribute the spread to a warming climate, which allows ticks to survive milder winters and thrive in a longer active season. The finding raises alarms about the increasing risk of vector-borne illnesses and prompts calls for greater public awareness and preventative measures.</p>
