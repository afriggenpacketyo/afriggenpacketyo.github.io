          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas resulted in at least 90 deaths over the holiday weekend, with many more still missing. The disaster was driven by a storm that dropped over 12 inches of rain, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the early morning hours. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the event, detailing how the flood-prone region was caught off guard. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the deluge struck.</p>

          <p>Survivors of the devastating Texas floods are sharing harrowing stories from Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp where at least 27 people died. Campers described being awakened by storms and seeing the camp destroyed by a horrific wall of water, with some recounting heroic actions by counselors who helped them escape. The camp, a beloved institution for generations, was situated on the banks of the Guadalupe River, a location that proved deadly when the river rose dramatically. This article focuses on the human element of the tragedy, capturing the grief and trauma experienced by those who were there.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods that killed over 90 people, questions are being raised about the adequacy of the official response and warning systems. This article examines the timeline of alerts issued by the National Weather Service, noting that while warnings were sent, they may have come too late or failed to convey the catastrophic scale of the event. Local officials stated the flood's severity was unexpected and cited the high cost of a more robust, siren-based warning system as a reason for its absence. The debate highlights the challenge of effective communication during rapidly developing natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new decentralized messaging app that functions without an internet connection. The app operates on a peer-to-peer basis, using Bluetooth mesh networks to relay encrypted messages between nearby devices, ensuring communication remains possible during internet outages or shutdowns. Designed for privacy and censorship resistance, Bitchat requires no personal data like phone numbers or emails and stores messages only on user devices. This project aligns with Dorsey's broader vision for user-owned, decentralized technology and communication platforms.</p>

This innovative approach could reduce side effects and combat antibiotic resistance. While animal trials have been promising, further research is needed to ensure safety before human application.</p>

With the deficit exceeding 6% of GDP, experts warn of potential fallout in markets, the economy, and international relations. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio see classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, while economists worry about inflation and the crowding out of private investment. The report also highlights national security concerns, as rising interest payments could squeeze defense spending, a historical precursor to the decline of great powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, speeding past $293 million at the global box office. This surpasses the company's previous top earner, "Napoleon," and marks a significant achievement for Apple's growing entertainment division. The film's success has been bolstered by a strong partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross. Despite its high ticket sales, the movie's large production and marketing budget, reportedly totaling up to $400 million, means it still has a considerable way to go to achieve profitability.</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man held captive by Hamas for 484 days, has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.

His plea comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with Trump to discuss a new deal, though significant gaps between Israel and Hamas reportedly remain.

Keeping exotic animals like lions is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite legal requirements and safety risks. Officials have also raided dozens of breeding farms and made several arrests as part of a broader effort to enforce regulations on the ownership of big cats.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent a repeat of a controversial incident caused by human error.

In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. The incident has also sparked a debate about implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, which officials will consider after the championships.</p>

The criticism comes as the Trump administration increases pressure on Apple to move iPhone production to the U.S. and away from countries like China and India, threatening tariffs of 25% or more on products made overseas.
