        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Donald Trump possesses the authority to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon. The 2-1 decision stays a lower court's temporary restraining order that had previously blocked the president's move to federalize the Oregon National Guard. The majority opinion concluded that the president likely acted within his statutory authority, which permits such action when regular forces are insufficient to execute federal laws. This ruling addresses a key legal conflict over federal versus state power during civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for James Comey have filed multiple motions seeking the dismissal of the two-count federal indictment against the former FBI Director. The legal team argues that the case is rooted in a vindictive and unlawful prosecution and also challenges the legitimacy of the interim U.S. Attorney's appointment. These filings represent the first step in a broader legal strategy to have the charges thrown out before a potential trial. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to consider these initial motions in November.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Reid Hoffman has publicly defended the AI startup Anthropic, calling it one of the "good guys" in the industry. This statement came in response to criticism from David Sacks, who serves as President Trump's AI and crypto czar and had accused Anthropic of fear-mongering to achieve regulatory capture. The exchange between the two prominent tech figures, both part of the original "PayPal mafia," highlights the increasing politicization of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning safety, ethics, and governmental regulation.</p>

          <h2>U.S.-Australia Rare Earths Pact Seen as Prelude to Trump-Xi Meeting</h2>

          <p>The newly signed critical minerals agreement between the United States and Australia is being interpreted as a strategic maneuver by the Trump administration ahead of a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The pact is framed as a key part of an effort to "de-risk" the global economy from potential Chinese "extortion" over resources vital to technology and defense. This move establishes a firm American stance on supply chain security, setting the stage for tense but potentially productive trade negotiations between the two world leaders.</p>

          <p>A recent report on leaked group chats has revealed the use of blatant antisemitic and bigoted language among leaders of Young Republican groups. The exposé has ignited a fierce debate within the conservative movement about the normalization of extremism and whether there is a growing problem on the young right. While some prominent figures have dismissed the comments, others argue it points to a "nasty iceberg" and are calling for the movement to draw a clear line against such rhetoric, highlighting a deep internal division.</p>

          <p>A memoir written by Virginia Giuffre before her death earlier this year details her allegations of sexual assault involving Prince Andrew, Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The book provides an in-depth account of the claims she maintained for years. Its discussion comes as Prince Andrew has already relinquished his royal titles in response to the scandal, although he has consistently and publicly denied all allegations made against him. The memoir brings renewed focus to the long-running controversy surrounding the prince's association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>Australian actor and "Neighbours" star Stefan Dennis has been forced to withdraw from the BBC competition "Strictly Come Dancing" after sustaining a significant tear in his calf muscle. The 66-year-old's departure is a setback for the contestant, who had only recently returned to the show after missing a week due to a bout of vertigo. In his last performance, he and his partner Dianne Buswell had achieved their highest score of the season, making his injury-forced exit particularly disappointing.</p>

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson confirmed the policy, which aims to address the financial unsustainability faced by universities after a decade-long fee freeze. However, the ability for institutions to charge the maximum fee will be contingent on providing high-quality teaching and achieving strong outcomes for students, as assessed by the Office for Students regulator.

The author argues this appeal to "freedom" is a disingenuous cover for a business strategy prioritizing deregulation and rapid development. The piece contends that this approach recklessly endangers vulnerable teens and calls for immediate regulatory intervention.</p>
