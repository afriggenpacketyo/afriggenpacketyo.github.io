        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, and President Trump's demand for unconditional surrender, Iran's mission to the UN has asserted that no Iranian official has ever sought to "grovel at the gates of the White House." The mission condemned Trump's threat to "take out" Iran’s Supreme Leader as cowardly, emphasizing that Iran will not negotiate or accept peace under duress. Iran vowed to respond to any threat with a counter-threat, further escalating the already tense situation. The statement underscores Iran's defiance and unwillingness to yield to external pressure. Optimism is relatively low given the escalation in rhetoric and the lack of de-escalation. </p>

          <p>The Princess of Wales has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Royal sources indicate that Catherine is working to find the right balance as she resumes public engagements. The Princess was reportedly disappointed to miss the event, where she was scheduled to participate in the carriage procession alongside her husband, the Prince of Wales, and King Charles and Queen Camilla. Despite her absence, other members of the royal family, including the King, Queen, Prince William, Prince Edward, and Princess Anne, attended the event, with Catherine's mother also present. It is a time of healing and the focus is on health. </p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, has opened a new manufacturing facility in Hayward, California, to ramp up production of its robotaxis. The facility is currently producing one robotaxi per day, with plans to accelerate production to a capacity of 10,000 robotaxis per year, or roughly three per hour. Zoox aims to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S., and more robotaxis are needed to fulfill this mission. The company has been testing its robotaxis on public roads since 2023 and expects to operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small-to-medium sized cities. </p>

          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that foreign criminals should expect to be deported, arguing that human rights law should not prevent such deportations. Speaking at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Mahmood said the UK is committed to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but believes it needs to evolve to respond to new threats. She cited cases where foreign criminals invoked Article 8 of the ECHR to avoid deportation, which she deemed "out of step with common sense." The Conservative party has called for human rights law to be disapplied from all immigration cases, while Liberal Democrats warn against leaving the ECHR. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Tennessee can limit or ban gender transition care for young people, a decision expected to have nationwide implications. The case, *United States v Skrmetti*, marked the first time the court addressed transgender healthcare. The court found that the Tennessee law, SB1, does not discriminate against transgender people. Dissenting justices argued the law is unconstitutional and endangers young people. The ruling allows 25 states with similar laws to continue limiting access to treatments like puberty blockers for under-18s. </p>

          <p>According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, was hacked for over $90 million. The funds were drained from platform wallets into addresses bearing anti-government messages referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), suggesting a politically motivated cyberattack. Pro-Israel hacking group Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility for the attack and stated it would release the exchange's source code. The same group also claimed credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah this week. The cyberattacks coincide with escalating tensions and exchanges of missile fire between Israel and Iran. </p>

The author contends that threats from some MAGA influencers that direct action against Iran would divide Trump's base are unfounded. They point to Trump's past actions, such as the killing of Iranian General Qasim Soliemani, as evidence that he is willing to take decisive action. The author suggests that Trump's base prioritizes stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and trusts his judgment in achieving that goal. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in *Nature* reveals that while global food production is at an all-time high, climate change is poised to diminish harvests, particularly in major crop-growing regions like the US Midwest. Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, key staple crops are projected to see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century. Extreme weather events, such as flooding and severe storms, are already impacting harvests worldwide. The study suggests that adaptations can slow some crop losses, but not all, potentially leading to food insecurity and higher prices globally. </p>

          <p>The Sunrise Movement is launching a new campaign to "villainize big oil" and push for the industry to pay for climate action, aiming to shift the financial burden away from ordinary people. The campaign, titled “End the Oligarchy, Save Our Futures,” will focus on passing "climate superfund" bills in statehouses across the country, requiring fossil fuel companies to pay for climate damage. The movement will also seek to re-energize the youth climate protest movement and push candidates to support ordinary people over corporate interests in the 2026 midterm elections. The campaign aims to harness populist outrage and challenge Trump's allegiance to oil bosses. </p>

The extension will last 90 days, during which the Administration will work to ensure a deal is closed to safeguard American users' data. This marks Trump's third pause in enforcing the bipartisan law passed in Congress last year. The ban's enforcement has been delayed due to issues such as Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on Chinese goods, which curtailed a potential deal to sell the app to American owners. </p>

It highlights research suggesting that men and women gossip at similar rates, but women tend to engage in more neutral gossip. The author contends that men's reticence to openly partake in gossip is linked to a fear of being perceived as "messy" or stirring the pot. The article further suggests that improving men's gossiping skills could potentially help address the male loneliness epidemic by fostering closer connections and intimacy. </p>
