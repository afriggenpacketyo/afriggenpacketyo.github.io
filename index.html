          <h2>Uber's Revenue Falls Short of Expectations Despite Increase in Trips</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uber's first-quarter results for 2025 revealed that while earnings per share exceeded expectations, revenue fell slightly short of anticipated growth. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, along with a net income increase from a net loss in the first quarter of 2024. Key segments such as mobility and delivery saw bookings increase year-over-year, and the number of monthly active platform consumers grew by 14% to 170 million. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted autonomous vehicles as the single greatest opportunity for the company, noting that Uber has reached an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called the change a bold action to improve train services and unlock thousands of jobs, with the Rail Safety and Standards Board affirming that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. This initiative aims to attract school or college leavers into the profession as a growing number of drivers are set to retire by 2029, while also addressing the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in the field. Training to become a mainline train driver typically takes one to two years, and the government believes new jobs and apprenticeships could become available as early as December.</p>

          <p>After a tumultuous election process, Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's chancellor, though his ascension was marked by an unprecedented failed first-round vote. As leader of a coalition government, Merz faces significant challenges, including addressing divisions within the country regarding migration, geopolitical tensions surrounding defense spending and trade, and a stagnating economy. Despite a major fiscal package aimed at boosting infrastructure and climate investment, questions remain about other economic policies and the potential for clashes over the country's budget. Experts emphasize the importance of trust within the coalition for the government to effectively implement its economic policy plans and address Germany's urgent need for economic reform.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns at an all-hands meeting after the company announced it would increase in-office requirements and change employee benefits. The company is now requiring employees to come into the office three days a week, up from two, and has raised the eligibility requirement for its month-long paid sabbatical benefit. Khosrowshahi defended the policy changes, stating that being in person more frequently is better for collaboration, innovation, and company culture. He said the changes were not related to cost cutting or planned layoffs, but rather to ensure Uber remains a high-performing company. The CEO acknowledged that the changes may be unpopular but emphasized their importance for the company's overall success.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has offered to assist with the development of the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago, citing significant cost overruns and delays. Trump linked the project's problems to its embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, claiming that prioritizing DEI over meritocracy has led to construction issues. The Obama Foundation, however, stated that Trump's remarks were not based in facts and that the center is not involved in the lawsuit, nor did it delay the timeline of the facility which is set to open in 2026. The foundation emphasized that the project is being funded privately and will serve as an economic engine for Chicago.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) journalists are speaking out after being shut out of their newsroom following an executive order by Donald Trump aimed at dismantling their parent company, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). VOA's programming reaches hundreds of millions globally, often as the only alternative to state-run media in countries with restricted press freedom. The Trump administration has accused the outlet of producing "propaganda," leading to broadcasts going dark and employees being placed on administrative leave. While a federal judge blocked the dismantling efforts, VOA staff remain on leave, with concerns raised about the impact on the agency's editorial independence and the potential for adversaries to fill the information void.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. They have identified a gene, HMGB1, that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots in upland rice, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, could significantly improve food security in regions facing water scarcity.</p>

As of March 2025, the IRS workforce had fallen by more than 11,000 employees, or 11%, due to probationary terminations and a deferred resignation program, as revealed in a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration report. The report coincided with President Donald Trump's fiscal year 2026 discretionary budget request, which called for a nearly $2.5 billion IRS budget cut to end the "weaponization of IRS enforcement."</p>

          <p>Walt Disney Co.'s earnings in the fiscal second quarter were propelled by new subscribers to Disney+ and Hulu, as well as spending at theme parks. The company reported a 7% increase in revenue, with the entertainment unit seeing a 9% rise, boosted by its streaming services. Disney+ and Hulu now have a combined 180.7 million subscribers, with growth attributed to new titles like "Moana 2" and "Mufasa: The Lion King". The experiences division, including parks and cruise lines, also saw revenue increase, driven by domestic theme park attendance and bookings on the Disney Treasure. China parks, however, did not fare as well.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church is set to begin the process of selecting Pope Francis' successor, with cardinals sequestered in Rome to elect a new leader. The conclave requires a two-thirds majority vote, and cardinals will be isolated from the outside world during the voting process. Different factions within the church have varying priorities, with some seeking a traditionalist leader and others favoring a progressive figure like Pope Francis. Several contenders have emerged as potential candidates, and the election will serve as a referendum on Francis' papacy and the direction of the Catholic Church.</p>

Figures like Patrick Deneen and Michael Anton, who see universities as centers of left-wing corruption, now hold key positions in government. Policies are being implemented to dismantle elite universities and wage culture wars within institutions like the Pentagon, reflecting the views of this insulated intellectual bubble.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has sentenced a woman to 14 months in prison, suspended for three years, for assisting her daughter in hiding the head of a man allegedly murdered and decapitated in Sapporo in 2023. Hiroko Tamura, 62, was found guilty of aiding in the abandonment of the corpse and allowing her daughter to film an act of desecration. The judge granted a suspended sentence due to Tamura's limited involvement, which was confined to allowing the head to be hidden after it had already been brought home. Tamura's husband, a psychiatrist, also received a suspended sentence for his involvement in the case.</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India against claims that it could disadvantage British workers. The deal includes an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years for people on short-term visas. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts the deal will not impact British workers, pointing to existing agreements preventing double taxation. Opposition parties argue the exemption could make Indian workers cheaper to employ, but Reynolds insists Indian workers will still pay the NHS immigration surcharge and not be eligible for National Insurance benefits. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India, particularly benefiting the Scotch whisky industry.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States have plunged by 27% year-on-year, reaching their lowest level since February, due to the impact of increased US tariffs. The decline in container bookings, seen as a proxy for export activity, signals deep disruption and sourcing shifts in the supply chain. Vizion, a supply chain intelligence firm, reports that shippers rushed to move products in the first quarter before sharply pulling back as new tariff policies introduced widespread uncertainty. Continuing uncertainty over future tariff levels is prompting many supply chain teams to rethink timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies.</p>

          <p>While AI models are increasingly used for forecasting, they still lag behind top human forecasters, known as superforecasters. Despite advancements in machine learning, AI's limitations in quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research hinder its ability to accurately predict world events. However, the gap between AI and human forecasters is narrowing, and AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and avoid cognitive biases could eventually make it a valuable tool for prediction. As AI models improve, they could transform various fields by providing more accurate and timely forecasts, although trust and adoption by decision-makers remain challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to discontinue federal research on pollution from satellites and rockets, including those from Elon Musk's space companies, which raises conflict-of-interest concerns. These research projects had the potential to lead to regulations, costs, or logistical challenges for Musk's companies. The administration claims the cuts are to eliminate support of woke ideology, but critics say it is protecting a donor and political ally. Pollution from spacecraft accumulates in the stratosphere, which could damage the ozone layer and destabilize the climate. As many as 100,000 satellites are expected to be in near-Earth orbit within a decade, exacerbating the issue.</p>
