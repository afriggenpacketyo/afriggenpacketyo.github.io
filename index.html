          <p>After weeks of rising tensions following a militant attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan have engaged in a significant military conflict involving airstrikes and drone attacks. Pakistan accused India of launching missiles targeting air bases, including one near Islamabad, prompting retaliatory actions. India claimed to have struck terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan. The escalating conflict has led to civilian casualties and heightened anxieties among residents near the border, with diplomatic efforts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the US, and Europe failing to de-escalate the situation. The article notes the use of drones as a new tool of war and the suspension of cricket leagues due to safety concerns.</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized Democratic representatives for storming an ICE facility in New Jersey, accusing them of prioritizing undocumented immigrants over American citizens. Reps. Rob Menendez Jr., Bonnie Watson Coleman, and LaMonica McIver entered the Delaney Hall detention facility with protesters, leading to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for trespassing. The White House spokesman condemned the act as crossing the line between political theater and breaking the law, while activists allege unlawful prevention of facility inspections by the GEO Group, the building's owner. The Department of Homeland Security denies these allegations.</p>

President Trump indicated he might lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of trade meetings, while also stating he will maintain a 10% baseline tariff for all countries. The US military and Okinawa authorities held their first safety forum following sexual assault allegations. Senior North Korean military officers greeted President Putin at a WWII anniversary event, and Myanmar's junta chief met with China's Xi Jinping for the first time since the 2021 coup.

          <p>State regulators announced that tap water is now safe to drink in all areas affected by the firestorms in Altadena and Pacific Palisades. The Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, the last utility with a "do not drink" notice, was cleared to resume delivering drinking water after four months. State and local utilities worked to assess damage, test for potential contamination like benzene, and restore pressure to the systems. Approximately 23,000 water customers were affected by the notices, and the restoration of service reflects the considerable effort undertaken by each utility, according to experts.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a former commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), is challenging his dismissal by President Trump, calling it illegal. Trumka stated his firing occurred after he opposed allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing it would compromise product safety. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firings, with Senator Amy Klobuchar calling the dismissals illegal. The White House maintains the president's right to fire employees in the executive branch. DOGE's efforts to cut federal workers have faced legal challenges and criticisms for mistakenly firing essential personnel.</p>

          <p>As trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, analysts are considering the possibility of China using its substantial holdings of U.S. mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as leverage. China holds over $1.2 trillion in MBS, representing 15% of outstanding mortgage balances in the U.S., according to Ginnie Mae estimates. Flooding the market with these securities could raise interest rates and destabilize the U.S. housing market, especially as mortgage rates are already rising.

          <p>The US and China are set to resume trade talks in Switzerland, marking the first high-level meeting since the US imposed tariffs on China in January. Despite previous tensions, both sides have signaled a willingness to break the deadlock, driven by economic pressures from the levies. Factory output in China has been affected, while uncertainty from tariffs led to economic contraction in the US. Trump has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting of the tariffs. Analysts suggest the talks aim to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on various factors, including domestic demand and the role of foreign suppliers. Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies heavily on global suppliers despite having a large trade surplus. Industry leaders express concerns about the potential impact on their supply chains, while companies like Boeing, RTX, and GE Aerospace estimate significant tariff costs. The investigation is being conducted under a provision of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the president to impose tariffs in the interest of national security.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her continued detention could chill free speech. The judge stated there was minimal evidence against her, primarily an essay critical of Israel. The Department of Homeland Security had accused her of supporting Hamas. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was detained in retaliation for her speech, and the conditions at the detention center were exacerbating her asthma. The judge's decision marks another defeat for government efforts to deport international students associated with pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

The exact location of the landing remains unknown, but its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude.
