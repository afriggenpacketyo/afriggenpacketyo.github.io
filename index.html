            <p>An analysis of Adolf Hitler's economic policies, particularly his emphasis on tariffs and protectionism, reveals parallels to modern trade debates. Hitler's policies, driven by a desire for economic self-reliance and nationalistic fervor, led to trade wars and economic instability. Despite inheriting a recovering economy, Hitler's tariff regime stunned observers and led to retaliatory measures from neighboring countries, highlighting the potential dangers of protectionist policies and their impact on global trade relations.</p>

            <p>With the constant barrage of political news causing misery, it's important to strategically manage one's attention and engagement. Instead of total avoidance, adopt a mindful approach by limiting intake to specific news sources and investing in activities that train moral attention. Practices like compassion meditation can help process difficult news without succumbing to empathy fatigue. The goal is to consume news in a way that enhances, or at least preserves, the capacity for moral attention and effective action.</p>

China's advantages include its dominance in key industries and its ability to redirect exports and implement economic countermeasures. The US could potentially win by building a coalition with allies, but Trump's policies have alienated potential partners, making a successful outcome less likely.
