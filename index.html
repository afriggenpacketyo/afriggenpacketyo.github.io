          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, reportedly left a note blaming the NFL for a traumatic head injury, suggesting he was targeting the league's offices in the building. Investigators are piecing together his cross-country journey to New York and the motives behind the attack. The tragic event has prompted responses from city officials and renewed calls for stricter gun control measures.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has told a House committee she will only provide a deposition if granted immunity or a presidential pardon. Her lawyer stated that without these conditions, she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights, citing her pending legal appeals. The House Oversight Committee has rejected the possibility of granting immunity. The article also notes President Trump's recent comments suggesting his dispute with Epstein stemmed from Epstein hiring employees away from his Mar-a-Lago club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pete Buttigieg has acknowledged that there are "serious fairness issues" in the debate over transgender athletes competing in women's sports, stating that parents who have complained "have a case." However, he argued that such decisions should be made by sports leagues and local school boards rather than by politicians in Washington. The article contrasts this with the Biden administration's previous executive orders supporting trans athlete inclusion and notes that President Trump has signed orders restricting it. It also cites polling data showing broad public opposition to trans women competing in women's sports.</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. was denied bond in a Florida court following his arrest on felony fraud charges originating from Nevada. The charges stem from two warrants alleging he wrote fraudulent checks for over $100,000 each to Nevada casinos. A prosecutor indicated that Nevada is seeking extradition but might dismiss the charges if the debts are paid in full. An attorney for Morris stated that a large payment has already been wired to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>In a heated exchange on the Senate floor, Senator Cory Booker accused his Democratic colleagues of being "complicit" with President Trump's agenda by attempting to pass a bipartisan policing package. Booker objected to the legislation, arguing it failed to address the Trump administration's alleged politicization of Justice Department grants, which he claims punishes jurisdictions that oppose the president. The rare moment of public intraparty conflict saw Booker call for Democrats to show more "backbone" and fight against what he termed unconstitutional actions by the executive branch.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Pentagon's Ban on Think Tank Engagement Stems from Insecurity and Fear</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques a new Pentagon directive under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that suspends participation in conferences and events hosted by think tanks and other civilian institutions. The author argues the policy is driven by resentment, insecurity, and a fear of officials misspeaking and drawing the ire of President Trump. By isolating itself from intellectual exchange, the Pentagon risks damaging civil-military relations and hindering its own strategic development. The ban is portrayed as a self-protective measure that ultimately harms national security by shutting down vital dialogue.</p>

          <p>In a significant move within the athleisure market, Gap's Athleta brand has appointed Maggie Gauger, the head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new CEO. The hiring is a major win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales, and a notable blow to Nike as it attempts to strengthen its position with female consumers. Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran, was central to the sneaker giant's strategy to close its gender gap in sales, and her departure creates a leadership vacuum at a critical time for the company.</p>

Companies like Novartis and Roche, with extensive overseas operations, appear more at risk, while those with larger U.S. manufacturing networks, such as AbbVie and Eli Lilly, seem better positioned. Analysts warn that high tariffs could be "problematic and punitive," potentially forcing companies to cut R&D spending or attempt to raise drug prices, which may be politically untenable.
