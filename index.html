          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with votes on a sweeping tax and immigration bill backed by President Trump, facing a marathon of Democratic-led amendments. Democrats are focusing their opposition on the bill's significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, arguing they harm working-class families to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Despite some Republican defections and concerns from moderate senators over the bill's impact on their constituents, the Republican majority has so far defeated all attempts to alter the legislation. The bill's passage remains uncertain as it requires near-total GOP unity before it can be sent back to the House for final approval.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Louisville, Kentucky, a move that will create 800 American jobs. A company executive stated that President Trump's tariff agenda was a key factor in accelerating the decision, making domestic production more financially viable. The company's "zero distance" philosophy, which advocates for building products in the markets where they are sold, also supported the move. The new plant is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production.</p>

This move signals Meta's intensified focus on competing with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to build superintelligence.

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his opposition to the Republican-led tax and policy bill, threatening to support primary challengers against any GOP members who vote for it. In a series of posts on X, Musk condemned the bill for increasing the national debt and suggested he would form a new "America Party" if it passes. His criticism focuses on the bill's spending levels and cuts to green energy tax credits, which he argues would harm the country. This stance puts him at odds with President Trump and the majority of the Republican party, signaling a potential return to political activism for the billionaire.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU argues that the act, intended for wartime, cannot be invoked to target a criminal gang, which does not constitute a military conflict or invasion as the law requires. Conversely, the Justice Department contends that the president has the authority to make this determination and that the court cannot overrule it. The administration claims the gang represents a "predatory incursion" and poses a significant threat to national security.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal will spare him from the death penalty, and he is expected to be sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. The agreement, which includes a waiver of all appeal rights, brings a conclusion to a case that shocked the small college town of Moscow. The victimsâ€”Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapinâ€”were stabbed to death in their off-campus home, leading to a lengthy investigation and Kohberger's arrest.</p>

The payment resolves a five-year-old dispute stemming from his former company's failure to pay compensation and benefits to four writers for a television project that was never produced. This resolution means WGA members are now permitted to work with Emmett and his current production company, Convergence Entertainment Group. The move clears a significant professional obstacle for Emmett as he seeks to move forward with new film projects, including a planned collaboration with director Martin Scorsese.</p>

These include serious crimes like war crimes but also extend to "material misrepresentations" on citizenship applications and other vaguely defined threats to national security. Legal experts express concern that pursuing these cases through civil litigation lowers the burden of proof and removes the right to a court-appointed attorney, potentially violating due process.

          <p>Despite widespread concern that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a new wave of inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable so far. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory before the tariffs took effect. Companies have also absorbed some costs to avoid losing customers and have utilized trade loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn that these are temporary measures and that consumers are likely to see prices rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place.</p>

          <p>A cartoonist for the Turkish satirical magazine Leman has been detained for questioning over a cartoon that allegedly depicted the Prophet Muhammad. The chief public prosecutor's office has launched an investigation, stating the cartoon "openly disparages religious values," and has issued arrest warrants for the magazine's editors as well. The magazine apologized for any offense but claimed the cartoon was misunderstood and was intended to critique violence, not insult Islam. This incident highlights the ongoing tension between secularism and religious sensitivities in Turkey, where insulting religious values can lead to imprisonment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to lift some, but not all, financial sanctions against Syria. The White House stated the move is intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, facilitating reconstruction and the return of displaced Syrians. Key sanctions, including those under the Caesar Act targeting reconstruction funds and Syria's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, will remain in place for now. The order directs administration officials to evaluate further sanctions relief, potentially providing leverage in future diplomatic negotiations involving Syria and its neighbors.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed reconciliation bill contains provisions that could significantly impact Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion, potentially leaving nearly 12 million more people uninsured by 2034. A key change is the imposition of new work requirements for many recipients, which experts warn could disproportionately affect older adults and those with health issues. Health policy advocates also fear that the funding cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers.</p>

          <p>The Republican-backed "big, beautiful bill" poses a significant threat to reproductive rights and access to care, according to advocates. The legislation aims to defund Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers for at least a decade, which could lead to the closure of nearly 200 clinics nationwide. Additionally, the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid would impact access to a wide range of non-abortion reproductive services for low-income individuals. The bill would also incentivize insurers in some states to drop abortion coverage from their ACA marketplace plans, further eroding access even in states where abortion remains legal.</p>

The report found that the bottom 20% of households would see an average income reduction of 2.9%, largely due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and SNAP. In contrast, the top 20% of households would experience an average income increase of 2.2%, driven by the bill's extensive tax cuts. This regressive outcome is because the loss of government benefits for lower-income families would far outweigh any tax relief they might receive. (not investment advice)</p>

This article calculates the potential interest earnings on a $10,000 deposit in both a short-term CD and a money market account over three, six, and nine-month periods. While CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed return, money market rates are variable and may change with market conditions. The analysis shows that while earnings are comparable, the best choice depends on a saver's need for liquidity versus their desire for a locked-in rate. (not investment advice)</p>
