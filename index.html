          <p>Elon Musk responded with "Whatever" after President Trump claimed the Tesla CEO was upset about the elimination of EV credits and the rejection of his NASA nominee. Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging the removal of pork while preserving EV/solar incentives. He emphasized the unfairness of untouched oil and gas subsidies in the bill. Trump expressed disappointment in Musk, stating he had helped him a lot.

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone, focusing exclusively on trade, and Trump stated that Xi invited him to visit China. Trump described the call as resulting in a very positive conclusion for both countries, with U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams expected to meet shortly at a location to be determined. This conversation marks a significant development amidst the ongoing tariff standoff between the U.S. and China. Prior to the call, Trump had acknowledged the difficulty of making a deal with Xi, while Chinese leaders expressed concerns about U.S. restrictions on tech exports and student visas. The discussion suggests a potential resumption of trade talks aimed at resolving the trade war. Optimism around the call could signal a move toward de-escalation of trade tensions. </p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group's stock experienced a substantial surge, climbing as high as 235% after its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, with shares opening at $69.50 following an IPO price of $31. The company, which issues the USDC stablecoin, raised nearly $1.1 billion in the offering, marking its second attempt at going public after a previous merger collapsed due to regulatory challenges. CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the importance of regulatory compliance and collaboration with governments for mainstream adoption of crypto. The stablecoin sector is gaining political favor and analysts predict it could grow tenfold in the next five years, potentially creating a trillion-dollar market. This performance reflects the crypto industry's renewed strength and investor confidence in Circle's position within the stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies, protecting them from Mexico's claims. Mexico had sought $10 billion in damages and stricter safety measures for U.S.-made guns. The decision is the first time the high court has weighed in on the gunmaker immunity enacted by Congress.

He described himself as a "proud British Muslim patriot" and had donated £200,000 to the party during the election campaign. His departure marks a significant shift within the party's leadership.</p>

Biden dismissed the allegations as ridiculous and a distraction from Republican legislative efforts. Trump's investigation follows renewed scrutiny into Biden's mental and physical capacity, including the publication of a book and audio recordings highlighting cognitive decline.
