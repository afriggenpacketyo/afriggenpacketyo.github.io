          <p>Intense overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have resulted in at least five deaths and widespread power outages across Ukraine. The strikes targeted infrastructure in several regions, including the western city of Lviv, where four fatalities occurred. In response to the aerial assault near its border, neighboring Poland scrambled its own fighter jets, along with allied NATO aircraft, to ensure the security of its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks, stating that Russia launched over 50 missiles and numerous drones, and he reiterated the urgent need for enhanced air defense systems to counter this aerial terror.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new powers that will allow police to place conditions on recurring protests by considering their cumulative impact on communities and public spaces. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified that this measure is not a ban but enables restrictions, such as relocating demonstrations that have repeatedly occurred at a single site. The move follows a weekend of arrests at protests and comes amid concerns that frequent demonstrations leave religious communities, particularly the Jewish community, feeling intimidated and unsafe. The government will also review existing protest legislation to ensure police powers are sufficient and consistently applied.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged the public to remain calm following numerous drone sightings over airports and military facilities, stating that the drones have not posed a concrete threat thus far. The incidents, which caused significant disruptions at Munich Airport and occurred during Oktoberfest, have prompted plans to establish a joint drone defense unit. While Russia is suspected of orchestrating the overflights to provoke uncertainty as part of a hybrid warfare strategy, officials are focused on enhancing the capabilities of federal and state police to manage such situations. An arrest was made in a separate drone incident near Frankfurt Airport.</p>

          <p>At least 22 people have been killed and a dozen more are missing in Nepal following heavy monsoon rains that triggered devastating landslides, flash floods, and lightning strikes. The eastern Ilam district was hit hardest, with multiple villages swept away and 18 fatalities reported, including six members of a single family whose home was buried. Rescue operations are underway, but efforts are being hampered by continuous rainfall and blocked roads. The severe weather has also disrupted domestic flights and shut down major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu, to the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the December ouster of former leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a direct popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by electoral colleges in various districts, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating an accurate voter registry due to mass displacement from the civil war as the reason for this system. While the process has drawn criticism, the results are being watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite record electric vehicle sales in the last quarter, the U.S. market is lagging behind global counterparts like China and Europe in EV adoption. A recent surge in American sales was largely driven by a government subsidy that expired at the end of September, with automakers now expecting demand to drop significantly. Policy differences, higher average EV prices in the U.S., and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to tariffs are key factors contributing to the slower transition. The future of the U.S. EV market now hinges on how carmakers adjust pricing in the absence of tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the club's growth has been more gradual than some expected, constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules, which limit financial losses. This has prevented the ownership from simply buying its way to the top, forcing a more strategic approach to player development and signings.

          <p>A growing number of politicians from both parties are supporting the expanded use of civil commitment, a legal process to force individuals into medical care for severe addiction and mental illness. President Trump has advocated for this approach to clear homeless encampments, but Democratic-led states like Oregon, California, and New York are also enacting laws to make such interventions more common. Proponents argue it is a necessary tool for people in crisis who cannot help themselves. However, critics and civil liberties advocates raise concerns about potential over-institutionalization and question whether sufficient resources exist for effective, humane treatment.</p>
