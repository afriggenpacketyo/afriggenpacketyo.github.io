          <p>This opinion article posits that China is uniquely positioned to shape the future of the Middle East due to its extensive trade and defense relationships throughout the region. The author argues that as the world's second-largest power and the top trading partner for many nations, Beijing can leverage its economic influence to foster constructive solutions and prevent wider conflicts. This contrasts with the West, which the article claims has failed to prevent multiple simultaneous conflicts despite advocating for a rules-based international order.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without Kyiv having to concede territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast, Clinton emphasized that a valid peace agreement must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a 'greater Russia.' She expressed a hope, which she termed a 'dream,' that Trump might stand up to Putin to protect not just Ukraine but also U.S. security interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in young adults achieving key milestones traditionally associated with adulthood. Researchers found that compared to previous generations, fewer people aged 25 to 34 are moving out of their parents' homes, getting married, or having children due to economic barriers and changing societal norms. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four major milestones, a figure that has dropped to less than a quarter today.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is positioning itself to enter the electric vehicle market with a low-cost, American-made pickup truck. The company's strategy involves selling a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 different accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate's primary challenge is maintaining its affordable price point, especially as the Trump administration has rolled back federal EV tax credits, potentially raising the vehicle's cost.</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental organizations has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Energy secretly commissioned a report by known climate contrarians. The lawsuit claims this "secret report," which is full of inaccuracies, was created to provide a scientific pretext for the EPA to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a key ruling that allows for the regulation of greenhouse gases. The groups argue the process violated federal transparency laws for government advisory panels.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted an injunction that was blocking the Trump administration from conducting mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court ruled that a lower court did not have jurisdiction to halt the layoffs, setting the stage for the administration to resume its plan to fire 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling is a major development in the ongoing legal and political battle over the future of the powerful consumer watchdog.</p>

          <p>A new report from Deloitte indicates that the cost for parents to pack a school lunch is rising, with the average price now at $6.15, up nearly 3% from the previous year. This increase is a direct result of broader food inflation, which has driven up the prices of grocery staples like whole milk and bananas. In response, many caregivers are planning to switch to store brands and choose cheaper meal options to manage the higher costs.</p>

Researchers found that roughly one in ten pediatric mental health ER visits for children on Medicaid result in them 'boarding' for three days or longer. This dangerous situation is caused by a nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for young people, and experts warn that these delays in appropriate care can worsen a child's condition.</p>
