        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off nearly 2,000 domestic employees as part of a major reorganization plan aimed at downsizing the federal workforce. The move follows a recent Supreme Court decision that permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the job cuts. The reorganization, initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, intends to streamline the department by eliminating or merging over 300 of its bureaus and offices deemed redundant. Affected employees are being notified, with the terminations expected to start imminently as the department aims to transition to a more 'results-driven diplomacy' model.</p>

Wang has called for a fairer international order, criticizing what he termed 'unilateral protectionism.'

          <h2>US Administration Announces 35% Tariffs on Canadian Goods Effective August 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 22:22:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating a trade dispute with one of its largest partners. The announcement, made via a letter to Canada's prime minister, cites Canada's retaliatory tariffs and alleges a failure to stop fentanyl trafficking as justifications for the new duties. This move extends a broader strategy of using tariffs to address trade imbalances and other policy goals, with the administration having sent similar letters to over 20 other nations. Economists express concern that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts are closely watching for the release of China's first-half economic performance data, anticipating it may reveal a need for greater fiscal stimulus to counteract external pressures. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns persist about underlying weaknesses in domestic demand and employment. The primary challenge remains the external uncertainty created by shifting U.S. trade policies, which has led many economists to advocate for more robust government support. These measures would be aimed at stabilizing the domestic economy and ensuring the full-year growth target is achieved amidst the ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean singer Moon Tae-il, a former member of the popular K-pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to sexual assault. The Seoul Central District Court delivered the sentence, which also includes a mandatory sexual violence treatment program, to Taeil and two other men involved in the 2024 assault of an intoxicated foreign tourist. The incident led to Taeil's departure from the group last year after his agency, SM Entertainment, acknowledged the seriousness of the criminal case. Prosecutors had initially sought a seven-year sentence for the defendants.</p>

          <h2>Political Strategist Claims to Have Identified the Eight Most Effective Words for Campaign Slogans</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe argues that a small set of words consistently resonates with voters in political campaigns worldwide. After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he identified eight key words: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. Bruni-Lowe suggests these words act as 'emotional shortcuts' that form the building blocks of successful slogans, from Bill Clinton's 'Putting People First' to Labour's recent one-word message, 'Change.' While not a guarantee of victory, he posits that these words effectively tap into universal voter sentiments across different cultures and political ideologies.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult classic novel *Trainspotting*, is releasing a new sequel titled *Men in Love* that explores his famous characters' lives immediately after the original story. In a recent interview, Welsh expressed concern that modern society, particularly due to the internet and artificial intelligence, is becoming a 'post-culture society' of 'dumbed down machines.' He fears that as machines think for us, human intellect atrophies, a change from the 1990s era his work captured. The author also reflected on the social decay that inspired his original work and how those themes of economic precarity are still relevant today.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, an opinion piece reflects on the international community's recurring pledge of 'never again' in the face of mass atrocities. The author, Ed Husic, draws a parallel between the suffering endured during the Bosnian war and the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article highlights the story of a Srebrenica survivor and questions how long it will take for the world to apply the same level of concern and action to Gaza as it has retrospectively to past genocides. It serves as a powerful call to break the cycle of witnessing, inaction, and belated recognition of human suffering.</p>

The application seeks approval for autonomous vehicle operations both with and without human safety drivers. This expansion follows Tesla's recent pilot program in Austin, Texas, where its vehicles operate with a remote supervisor and an in-car safety monitor. While once a pioneer, Tesla is now playing catch-up to Waymo, which has operated a public driverless service in the Phoenix area since 2020, as it works to refine its camera-based autonomous driving technology.</p>

Harris, a key free-agent acquisition for the Chargers, signed a one-year deal and is anticipated to be a major contributor to the team's running game. The confirmation from his agent helped to quell online speculation about a more severe injury, providing relief for the team and its fans as they prepare for the new season.</p>

          <p>As the UK experiences its third heatwave of the year, analysis shows that this is part of a clear, long-term trend driven by human-induced climate change. Spring 2025 was the UK's warmest on record, and recent temperatures are significantly above average, a pattern consistent with global warming. Climate scientists warn that a 1°C rise in global temperature can translate to heatwaves that are 3-4°C warmer regionally. While many compare the current heat to the summer of 1976, data shows that event was an isolated anomaly in a cooler decade, whereas today's extreme heat is becoming a more frequent and widespread feature of UK summers.</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry even as it struggles with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility treatments rose by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022, and one in six babies in Seoul last year was born with such assistance. Experts attribute this to a generational shift, with more people delaying childbirth for social and financial reasons and then turning to medical technology to start families later in life. While the country's demographic crisis remains severe, the demand for these services signals a persistent desire for children among the population.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate that outpaces the general trend of global warming. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, indicate that the longest and most extreme heat waves are becoming more frequent and will accelerate with each fraction of a degree of warming. This phenomenon poses significant risks, particularly in tropical regions, and underscores the urgent need for accelerated adaptation strategies to protect populations, agriculture, and infrastructure. The researchers warn that continued cuts to climate science funding could hamper the ability to make specific regional projections for risk management.</p>

UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima stated this could lead to an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths in the next four years.

The National Head Start Association warned the move could create fear and confusion among all families, not just those directly affected.

The updated forecast assumes a 30% tariff on China and 10% on the rest of the world, but the company acknowledges this could change as U.S. trade policy evolves. (not investment advice)</p>
