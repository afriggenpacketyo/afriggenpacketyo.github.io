          <p>Nvidia has stated it expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China soon, following assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This development comes after previous U.S. restrictions had halted sales of the chip, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The move is seen as a significant win for Nvidia, potentially boosting its market share in China and reflecting a possible shift in U.S. tech export policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's president is reportedly planning a visit to the U.S., with potential stops in New York and Houston, a move expected to provoke anger from Beijing. The visit is framed as a "stopover" en route to Paraguay, a diplomatic ally, and follows a preparatory trip by Taiwan's foreign minister. Analysts suggest the choice of non-political hubs like New York is intended to leverage global financial connections while avoiding the direct political provocation of a visit to Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. Despite the strong headline figure, the growth rate slowed from the previous quarter, and underlying data reveals weaknesses, including a slowdown in retail sales and a deepening slump in real estate investment. While the better-than-expected performance may reduce immediate pressure for major stimulus, economists point to fragility and disinflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the BBC's annual salary report reveals why many of its highest-profile stars do not appear on the public list of top earners. The disclosure requirement only applies to talent directly employed by the BBC, not those hired through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. This means the salaries of stars from major shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and "The Apprentice" are not included, providing an incomplete picture of the corporation's total spending on top talent.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these products are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. The study noted that ingestions of these pouches, which are often flavored and colorfully packaged, were more likely to result in serious medical outcomes compared to other nicotine products.</p>

          <p>The article profiles FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a former right-wing podcaster whose future is uncertain after a reported clash with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a controversial appointee with no prior FBI experience, allegedly threatened to quit after a heated meeting regarding the public fallout from a DOJ memo that concluded Epstein died by suicide and a rumored "client list" did not exist. This internal conflict highlights deep divisions within the Trump administration over the politically charged case.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to decline hearing an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued her conviction was invalid because a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Epstein should have also protected his co-conspirators. The DOJ countered that the agreement was only intended to apply within the specific Florida district where it was made and that Maxwell was an incidental beneficiary.</p>

While two men face sentencing for the act, experts and charities argue the incident reveals systemic weaknesses, as many ancient and culturally significant trees lack automatic protection. There are now calls for new legislation to create a statutory list of "heritage trees" with stricter penalties for damaging them, similar to protections for historic buildings.</p>
