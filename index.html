          <p>A German data protection authority has called on Apple and Google to block the Chinese artificial intelligence app, DeepSeek, from their app stores. The Berlin data protection commissioner stated that the app unlawfully transfers German user data to China, where it could be accessed by Chinese authorities, violating the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This action follows similar scrutiny from regulators in Italy and Ireland and could potentially lead to an EU-wide ban if other member states concur or if the tech giants comply with the request. The case highlights growing European pressure on Chinese tech firms regarding data privacy and security.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the presidential debate one year ago between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, which is framed as a pivotal moment that severely damaged Biden's reelection campaign. The performance reportedly amplified existing concerns about his age and mental fitness, leading to widespread panic within the Democratic Party and calls from allies for him to step aside. Despite initial defenses from the White House, the pressure mounted, culminating in Biden withdrawing from the race less than a month later and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. The piece details key moments from the debate and the subsequent political fallout that reshaped the presidential election.</p>

          <p>The once-iconic hotel minibar, popularized in the 1970s, has largely fallen out of favor with major hotel chains due to logistical and financial challenges. High operational costs, food spoilage, and theft made the amenity more of a burden than a revenue generator for many establishments. In response, hotels have shifted towards more modern and profitable alternatives like 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery services such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub. While some luxury and boutique hotels are reimagining the minibar with curated local products, it is becoming a relic in most midscale hotels, replaced by more convenient options for travelers.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies and governments are heavily investing in quantum computing, a technology that promises to solve problems currently impossible for traditional computers, though it remains largely in the research phase. While potential applications include breakthroughs in medicine, material science, and AI, the most immediate concern is its ability to break current encryption standards, posing a significant national security risk. Researchers are focused on overcoming major hurdles like error correction and scaling the number of qubits from dozens to the millions needed for a practical machine.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, invite-only launch for its robotaxi service in Austin, which generated both praise and criticism. While some participants, like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, lauded the experience as smooth and impressive, other vehicles reportedly exhibited erratic behavior, including driving on the wrong side of the road and stopping abruptly in traffic. The event highlights Tesla's unique camera-only approach to autonomous driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar. CEO Elon Musk's long-standing promises of full autonomy remain unfulfilled, and the limited, supervised nature of the launch suggests the technology is still far from a widespread, driverless reality.</p>

The strategy includes reintroducing popular Hemi V-8 engines, launching a new industry-leading powertrain warranty, and returning to NASCAR to boost brand visibility. Kuniskis aims to reclaim a substantial market share, targeting a figure in the 20-29% range, up from the current 17%, by focusing on both retail sales and operational efficiency. The turnaround plan, which extends through 2026, also involves delaying some electrification projects to align with current market demand and launching new models. (not investment advice)</p>

Amid the fallout, Araghchi also declared that there are no plans to resume nuclear negotiations with the United States.

This move follows a similar warning from rival Adidas about price hikes. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China have reportedly agreed on a framework for a trade deal involving rare earth metals, though uncertainty remains as a 90-day tariff pause nears its expiration.

Officials described how analysts meticulously studied the fortified Fordo facility, leading to the development of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb specifically for the target. During the strike, twelve of these bunker-buster bombs were dropped into ventilation shafts to cause maximum internal damage.

          <p>Scientists report they may have found the oldest rocks on Earth within Canada's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Quebec. Using two different dating techniques, a new study estimates the rocks are approximately 4.16 billion years old, settling a long-standing dispute over their age. These primordial rocks are extremely rare, as Earth's tectonic activity typically recycles older formations. Studying such ancient samples provides a valuable glimpse into the planet's earliest history, including how its crust formed and potentially how life began. The site, located on Inuit tribal lands, is currently restricted to prevent damage while a plan for its protection and research is developed.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government has scaled back its planned welfare reforms, significantly reducing the expected savings from £5 billion to approximately £2 billion annually. The U-turn means that changes to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) eligibility will now only apply to new claimants, sparing hundreds of thousands of current recipients. This reversal, alongside other concessions, complicates the chancellor's efforts to meet self-imposed borrowing rules and will likely require finding funds through higher taxes or other spending cuts.

Senators including Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated their belief that significant nuclear capabilities and knowledge remain in Iran, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years or decades as the president claimed. They expressed concern that the administration was misleading the public and lacked a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Most of England is under heat health alerts as the country prepares for a second heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach the mid-30s Celsius early next week. An amber alert, indicating potential impact on the entire population and health services, is active for London and southern and eastern regions, while a less severe yellow alert covers the Midlands and Yorkshire. The heat is forecast to coincide with the Glastonbury Festival and the start of the Wimbledon tennis championships, which could see its hottest opening day on record. While sunny conditions are expected, authorities warn of the risks associated with high temperatures, especially for the elderly and vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A wave of clemency applications is being sent to the White House, with prisoners and their attorneys carefully crafting their requests to appeal to President Donald Trump's personal inclinations and political grievances. Applicants are highlighting themes of political persecution, criticizing the FBI, and framing themselves as victims of a weaponized justice system, mirroring language often used by the president himself. This trend comes as Trump has largely bypassed the traditional Justice Department review process, instead granting over 1,600 pardons and commutations to political allies, supporters, and others. Legal experts describe the situation as a "free-for-all" that has replaced established procedures with presidential caprice.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta argues that the U.S. military's effectiveness and the nation's security depend on it remaining apolitical. He emphasizes that service members swear an oath to the Constitution, not the president, and that their judgment must be based on mission objectives, not partisan goals. Panetta contrasts this with autocratic regimes where the military's primary role is to protect the ruler. He warns that any attempt by a president to misuse the military for political purposes undermines the trust of the American people and weakens the fundamental principles that separate a free society from a tyranny.</p>

          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," uses a historical fantasy setting in Dust Bowl-era Nebraska to explore the dangers of memory erasure. The story centers on a "prairie witch" who stores painful memories for townspeople, allowing them to avoid guilt, including the founding shame of stealing land from American Indians. The novel argues against the fantasy of shedding the past, suggesting that memories, both personal and collective, must be kept in circulation for societal health and individual self-knowledge. Through its characters, the book posits that confronting and sharing difficult histories, rather than hiding them, is essential for justice, healing, and maintaining a true sense of identity.</p>

          <p>A contentious debate is underway over whether to remove the grizzly bear from the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) list, a decision with major implications for conservation policy. After being listed in 1975, the grizzly population in the Yellowstone area has recovered successfully, exceeding all biological benchmarks and now numbering over 1,000. Proponents of delisting argue that the ESA's purpose is to recover species, not protect them indefinitely, and that state agencies are equipped to manage the population. Opponents fear that removing federal protections would expose the bears to new threats like hunting and habitat loss, arguing the recovery is still fragile and could be reversed by political pressures.</p>

The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum previously threatened her with a knife, and he had tracked her location before the attack. Despite pleading guilty to manslaughter, the jury found him guilty of murder, as well as stalking and making threats to kill, following a nationwide manhunt that ended with his arrest in Buckinghamshire.</p>

This is creating intense competition and price wars in sectors like the auto industry, leading experts to believe a market consolidation is inevitable.

The Justice Department is not asking the court to overturn those decisions but is arguing that judges exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide injunctions.

          <p>A new report indicates a split in the luxury real estate market, with ultra-high-net-worth individuals (worth $30M+) continuing to make large, all-cash purchases despite economic uncertainty. In contrast, less wealthy but still affluent buyers are acting more cautiously, being more sensitive to high interest rates. According to a survey of luxury agents, over half have seen an increase in all-cash offers in 2025, as wealthy buyers seek to avoid high borrowing costs and leverage real estate as a hedge against inflation. However, the market saw a dip in May, and buyers at all luxury price points have become more discerning about property condition and amenities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Russian missile attack on the town of Samar in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region has killed five people and left 23 injured, according to the regional governor. This strike is part of a recent escalation of attacks on the industrial region as Russian forces attempt to establish a foothold there. The attack follows another deadly strike earlier in the week that killed at least 23 people in the area. Meanwhile, in a separate diplomatic development, Russia summoned the German ambassador to announce retaliatory measures over the alleged "persecution" of Russian journalists in Germany, further straining relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon draw has pitted British number one Emma Raducanu against 17-year-old British wildcard Mimi Xu in a notable first-round match. Raducanu, who narrowly missed being seeded, faces a potentially challenging path, with a possible third-round encounter against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. A record 23 British players are in the singles draws this year, the most since 1984, though many have received difficult draws against seeded opponents. Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz could face British qualifier Oliver Tarvet in the second round, while seven-time champion Novak Djokovic is in the same quarter as Britain's top-ranked man, Jack Draper.</p>
