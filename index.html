          <p>Congressional Democrats have released new files from the Jeffrey Epstein Estate, which appear to show Elon Musk was invited to Epstein's private island in 2014. The documents also include a flight manifest from 2000 listing Prince Andrew as a passenger on a flight with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Other prominent figures like Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon are also mentioned in Epstein's schedules, though the files do not suggest they were aware of his criminal activities. The release has intensified calls for greater transparency regarding Epstein's network of powerful associates.</p>

          <p>Austin police have identified Robert Eugene Brashers as a suspect in the 1991 quadruple murder of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop, a case that has remained unsolved for over three decades. The breakthrough came from new DNA evidence linking Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, to the crime scene. Brashers was a known predator, and DNA also linked him posthumously to three sexual assaults and murders in other states. Two other men were previously convicted for the murders, but their convictions were later overturned due to a lack of DNA evidence.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired up to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a protest in Washington, D.C., following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Sources indicate the agents, many from the Washington Field Office, knelt as a de-escalation tactic when faced with a large group of protesters. An earlier internal review had found their actions were not a political statement. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the terminations, calling them part of a "dangerous new pattern" by the FBI Director that damages trust and morale within the bureau.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is facing a potential shutdown as Congress has only four days to pass a funding bill. Republicans are advocating for a "clean" temporary extension, while Democrats want to include extensions for Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. A shutdown would furlough hundreds of thousands of non-essential federal employees and could delay the release of crucial economic data, such as the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The political standoff has increased the likelihood of a shutdown, with both parties preparing for the potential fallout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has found that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan shooting in July, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied. Investigators believe he was targeting the NFL's offices, blaming the league for concealing the dangers of head injuries.

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the deployment of Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities nationwide. The move is a response to what ICE describes as a spike in attacks and threats against its agents amid increased immigration enforcement operations. Bondi also directed Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate these incidents as potential "domestic terrorism," signaling a significant escalation in the federal response to protests and violence directed at immigration authorities. The specific DOJ agencies to be deployed have not been detailed.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 major hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph. As of Friday night, the storm was located approximately 390 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands and was moving west. The National Hurricane Center has not issued any coastal watches or warnings for the U.S. mainland at this time. Forecasters are also monitoring a second weather system in the Caribbean that is likely to develop into a tropical depression and could bring heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Humberto strengthens in the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with a nearby developing storm system, potentially creating a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely due to the second system's relative weakness, it remains a scientific possibility. The interaction could slightly change the forecast tracks of both storms as they move through the western Atlantic region.</p>

Shortly after communicating this legal requirement, she was abruptly terminated from her 15-year career at the Department of Justice.

          <p>A 29-year-old California man, Varun Suresh, has been charged with murder for allegedly carrying out a planned, vigilante-style killing of a 71-year-old registered sex offender.

Suresh reportedly told police that he deliberately targeted the victim, David Brimmer, due to his past conviction for lewd acts with a child.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with its freeze on over $4 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved by Congress. In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority ruled that the potential harm to the president's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the harm to aid recipients. The three liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision undermines Congress's constitutional "power of the purse" and the separation of powers. This ruling supports the administration's broader policy of significantly reducing U.S. foreign aid, a move that humanitarian groups warn could have severe global consequences.</p>

This move reflects a broader national strategy encouraged by Beijing for Chinese tech firms to prioritize domestic hardware.

          <p>The three detainees shot during a "targeted attack" on a Dallas ICE facility have been identified in multiple news reports. Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador was fatally shot, while Miguel Angel García-Hernandez of Mexico and Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela were injured. The alleged shooter, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, reportedly left notes indicating his targets were ICE employees, not the detainees. The family of García-Hernandez, who was shot multiple times and is in serious condition, has started a GoFundMe campaign to cover expenses as he was their main provider.</p>

          <p>Researchers have reported a major breakthrough in the treatment of Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no current cure. A new gene therapy has been shown to slow the disease's progress by 75% in a clinical trial, offering unprecedented hope to patients and their families. The treatment involves a complex brain surgery to deliver the therapy. While the full study results are yet to be published and regulatory approval is still years away, the news has been met with emotional relief within the Huntington's community, which has long awaited any effective treatment for the devastating condition.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted three women on charges of conspiracy and illegally disclosing the personal information of a federal agent. The women are accused of "doxing" an ICE agent by following him from a federal building to his private residence in Baldwin Park and live-streaming the event. According to the indictment, they shouted phrases like "la migra lives here" to alert neighbors. The case is one of the first prosecutions related to doxing federal immigration agents, a tactic that has drawn concern from law enforcement amid protests against the administration's immigration policies.</p>

The school board expressed surprise, stating they were still gathering facts about the case and described Roberts as an integral part of their community.

Decker, a former soldier with survival skills, was the subject of a monthslong manhunt before his minimal skeletal remains were recently found and identified via DNA. The coroner stated that due to the condition of the remains and the time that has passed, an autopsy is not possible. Decker was the sole suspect in the May suffocation deaths of his three daughters, ages 9, 8, and 5.</p>

          <p>The urban planning philosophy long championed by King Charles is reportedly inspiring the design of a new generation of towns in England. Government officials have outlined plans for 12 new towns that will prioritize walkability, "gentle density" like terraced housing over high-rises, and environmental sustainability. These principles align closely with the King's advocacy for traditional architecture and community-focused design, as seen in his projects like Poundbury. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's views on creating humane and harmonious living spaces are now being integrated into mainstream government planning for future housing developments.</p>

Their journeys revealed the emotional toll of chasing views, the burden of engaging with comments, and the struggle to maintain authenticity. While some found that social media could amplify their professional work, the experiment highlighted the immense time, effort, and mental resilience required to achieve even modest online traction.</p>

While data confirms that some car models are sitting on lots for over 100 days and 0% financing offers exist, these trends may not signal a full-blown crash. Factors such as a mismatch in regional demand, a slowdown in EV sales, and manufacturers' inventory strategies also contribute to the current market conditions.
