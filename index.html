          <p>Consumer price inflation in the euro zone rose to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time in months. This figure, which matched economists' expectations, followed a drop to 1.9% in May. Core inflation remained steady at 2.3%, while services inflation saw a slight increase. The data reinforces expectations that the ECB may proceed with an interest rate cut in the third quarter, with the bank's chief economist suggesting the recent cycle of policy interventions is now complete.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office amid an investigation into a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen. The call, in which she criticized a Thai military commander, prompted a petition for her dismissal over ethical concerns. This development continues a pattern of political turmoil for the Shinawatra family, which has seen multiple leaders removed from power. The court's decision underscores its significant influence in Thai politics, a power that critics argue is often used to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL player and U.S. Representative, has officially launched his 2026 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas. His entry sets the stage for a competitive race, particularly as incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton. Allred's campaign focuses on lowering costs and opposing what he terms corrupt politicians. Democrats view the race as a key opportunity, though they face significant historical challenges, having not won a statewide Texas race since 1994.</p>

          <p>A research report published in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's decision to cut over 80% of U.S. foreign humanitarian aid could lead to more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030. The study estimates that a third of these potential premature deaths would be among children under five. Researchers state the funding cuts, overseen by an initiative led by Elon Musk, risk reversing two decades of health progress in low- and middle-income countries. The move has been widely condemned by humanitarian organizations amid what the UN calls the deepest funding cuts ever to hit the sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article frames the victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary as a cautionary tale for the American right. The author argues that Mamdani's success with a platform of price controls, free transit, and higher taxes demonstrates the power of left-wing populism. The piece contends that by embracing state power and economic interventionism, right-wing populism inadvertently legitimizes the left's more radical promises. It warns that if conservatives abandon principles of limited government and free enterprise, they will ultimately lose to politicians who can more effectively wield populist rhetoric.</p>

          <p>China has appointed Chen Xiaojiang as the new Communist Party secretary for the Xinjiang region, a historically significant position. Chen, 63, previously served as the executive deputy minister of the United Front Work Department, which oversees ethnic and religious affairs. The role of Xinjiang party chief traditionally includes a seat on the powerful 24-member Politburo. This appointment positions Chen for a potential promotion within the party's top leadership, placing him at the helm of a region central to Beijing's policies on ethnic minorities and security.</p>

Mamdani defended his proposals for free public transit and expanded childcare, arguing they are feasible and popular, citing his past success with a fare-free bus pilot. He also clarified that his controversial remarks about billionaires were meant to highlight extreme wealth inequality, not to propose their elimination. Mamdani acknowledged the racist and anti-Muslim attacks against him but affirmed his commitment to representing all New Yorkers and tackling hate crimes.</p>

Conversely, in-person voting surged, with a majority of ballots cast either early or on Election Day for the first time.

          <p>State and national lawmakers are pushing for legislation to improve medical training on menopause, addressing a significant gap in physician education. A 2023 study found that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, leaving many patients with unresponsive or inadequate care for symptoms like hot flashes and cognitive issues. California's Assembly Bill 432, if passed, would mandate menopause coursework for license renewal for certain doctors. This legislative trend, seen in over a dozen states, aims to ensure physicians are better equipped to treat a condition experienced by half the population.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old gardener in Chesterfield, UK, experienced a life-threatening accident when a chainsaw he was using to trim hedges flipped and slashed his neck. The man, Christopher York, lost over two liters of blood from a two-inch gash that missed his jugular vein by only one millimeter. In a strange turn of events, his wife was briefly suspected by police of attacking him after she attempted to dispose of the blood-soaked chainsaw. Thanks to the quick work of a vascular surgeon, York survived the incident and is now in recovery after spending weeks in intensive care.</p>

The legislation's fate is uncertain as Republicans, who control Congress, are divided over the extent of welfare program cuts needed to fund extensions of Trump's tax breaks. The bill, which passed the House by a single vote, is projected by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The lengthy "vote-a-rama" process involves debates and votes on numerous amendments, highlighting deep intra-party fissures over fiscal policy.</p>

This follows a trend among Chinese tech companies, like Baidu, to promote open-source development. Experts believe this will incentivize the use of Huawei's other products, particularly its Ascend AI chips, which are China's primary competitor to Nvidia's advanced hardware. By integrating its software and hardware, Huawei aims to solidify its position across the entire AI value chain, overcoming U.S. export restrictions.</p>

To counter this, experts proposed leveraging open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services.

Economists at Nomura and strategists at Citi also view the bill as a short-term positive for growth, though others, like the Tax Foundation, have flagged long-term fiscal irresponsibility and administrative burdens.

          <p>China has offered a tax refund to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and RÃ©my Martin, amid an ongoing anti-dumping investigation into European brandy. According to a source, the offer is conditional on the companies agreeing to a minimum selling price and committing to fair trade practices. The investigation is set to conclude on July 5, and if no agreement is reached, temporary tariffs of up to 39% could become permanent. This move is seen as a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between China and the European Union.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a major review of the parental leave and pay system, aiming to modernize policies for maternity, paternity, and shared leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds described the current system, with its eight different leave types, as confusing and unsupportive compared to other countries. The review comes after a parliamentary committee labeled the UK's system one of the worst in the developed world. Campaigners have welcomed the move as a generational opportunity, noting that low statutory pay discourages many fathers from taking leave.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly decline since February 2023. This drop may be a reflection of weaker demand following April's changes to stamp duty thresholds, which increased the tax burden for many buyers. Despite the monthly fall, the annual price growth rate slowed to 2.1%. However, economists expect the housing market to rebound in the coming months, supported by low unemployment, rising earnings, and the potential for lower interest rates from the Bank of England.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is grappling with a significant backbench rebellion over its plans to tighten eligibility for disability benefits. Over 120 Labour MPs have threatened to oppose the changes, forcing ministers to offer concessions, such as delaying the implementation of stricter criteria for new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) claimants until late 2026. Despite having a large majority, the government is engaged in a major persuasion effort to unify the party ahead of a key vote.

The board points to Trump's criticism of Senator Thom Tillis, who subsequently announced he would not seek reelection, as the latest example of self-sabotage. The editorial argues that by creating pickup opportunities for Democrats, Trump risks losing the Republican majority in Congress. This would effectively render his administration powerless to advance legislative reforms or confirm judicial nominees, leaving his presidency "dead in the water."</p>

The charity received over 34,400 cruelty reports between June and August, up from nearly 26,000 in the same period the previous year. The RSPCA suggests the summer spike is partly due to more people being outdoors and witnessing abuse.

The extreme violence is attributed to a bloody power struggle between two rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, known as Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. The conflict has turned the city into a warzone, with daily killings and a pervasive sense of fear as authorities struggle to regain control.</p>

          <p>California's fire season has started intensely, with over a dozen wildfires breaking out in a 72-hour period across the state. The largest blazes, the Wolf and Juniper fires, are burning in Riverside County, forcing evacuations and road closures. The Wolf fire has grown to over 2,400 acres, while the Juniper fire has prompted evacuation orders for hundreds of residents. Officials are warning that these fires are a precursor to a dangerous summer and fall, following an unusually dry winter and spring, with red flag warnings active in several Northern California counties.</p>

          <h2>Over 130 Charities Call for Shutdown of Controversial Gaza Aid Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 01:02:06 EDT</div>

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, is demanding the closure of the Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The groups state that over 500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 4,000 injured while seeking aid since the GHF began operations, alleging that Israeli forces and armed groups routinely open fire on civilians at distribution sites. The charities argue the program violates humanitarian norms by forcing people into overcrowded, militarized zones. Israel denies deliberately shooting aid recipients and defends the GHF system.</p>
