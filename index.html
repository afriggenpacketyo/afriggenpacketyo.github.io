          <p>A small Vans RV-10 plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood, resulting in the deaths of the pilot and a passenger on board. The aircraft had departed from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster and was en route to Camarillo Airport when the incident occurred. Residents inside the two-story, single-family homes were safely evacuated without injuries as firefighters extinguished the blaze and managed salvage operations. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days and a full report potentially taking up to two years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of offering citizenship to foreign investors, effectively banning the last "golden passport" program in the EU. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a mere commercial transaction, undermining solidarity and mutual trust between member states. While Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, stating it had raised millions for charitable causes, the court's decision has led to discussions about extending the reasoning to "golden visa" programs, which offer residence permits for real-estate purchases or other major investments. These schemes raise concerns about security, money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption risks for the EU as a whole.</p>

          <p>The South Texas facility and launch site for Elon Musk's SpaceX has been formally approved as the new city of Starbase after a vote among residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The vote tally was overwhelmingly in favor of the incorporation. Musk celebrated the decision, highlighting the importance of Starbase for SpaceX's rocket program, which is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA. Critics, however, worry about Musk's increased control over the area and the potential for restricted access to a local beach and state park for launches, while SpaceX officials emphasize the need to streamline launch operations and manage local infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Kenya is grappling with a severe economic crisis, leading to increased payroll taxes and new excise taxes on various goods to generate revenue and manage its staggering foreign debt. These measures have significantly reduced the take-home pay of Kenyans, impacting their buying power and causing widespread discontent. The country's debt has surged to $80 billion, with nearly 60% of revenue being used to pay off loans, leaving limited funds for essential services like healthcare and education. While the government aims to stabilize finances for long-term growth, the heavy tax burden on a small percentage of the population and concerns about corruption are fueling public frustration and raising the specter of further protests.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has presented a serious challenge to the governing Labour Party and the opposition Conservatives, potentially disrupting Britain's traditional two-party system. Reform U.K. has made extensive gains in local elections in England, energized by Farage's vigorous campaigning, indicating a growing disenchantment with the two main parties. Political analysts suggest that both Labour and the Conservatives are struggling to compete with smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, as well as Reform, which is attracting voters who feel the traditional parties have lost touch with working-class concerns. The next general election in 2029 will be a crucial test of whether this shift in voter sentiment will lead to a lasting change in British politics.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's manufacturing sector, a key driver of its economic growth, faces uncertainty as President Trump considers imposing a 46% tariff on goods imported from the country. This prospect is causing concern among factory workers and managers, with some companies already cutting jobs or freezing hiring due to canceled orders from American retailers. Vietnam's textile and garment factories, operating on thin profit margins, risk significant losses if the tariffs are implemented, potentially impacting the country's dependence on demand from the United States. While the Vietnamese government is seeking a deal with the Trump administration to reduce tariffs, the uncertainty surrounding the trade situation is already affecting the country's economic stability.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, further disrupting the broadcaster's operations. The court's decision reverses an earlier order that mandated the Trump administration to reinstate VOA employees and contractors who were placed on leave following an executive order. The ruling has sparked concerns about the future of VOA, with one judge dissenting and warning that the network may cease to exist in any meaningful form.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students.

Supporters, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private education.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name upon marriage.

While some political parties advocate for the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values.

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by aggressive expansion, price competition, and increasing accessibility to the masses, leading to a surge in coffee shop openings. This growth is occurring alongside an official push to promote domestic beans. While the overall market is expanding, Starbucks' market share in China has significantly declined, falling from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as domestic and international competitors gain ground. Much of the market's growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, indicating a broader adoption of coffee culture beyond major urban centers.</p>

          <p>Germany's foreign ministry has pushed back after Marco Rubio criticized the country’s decision to designate the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force incompatible with its constitution. The ministry said that the courts would have the final say and that “we have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped”. The US secretary of state had called the move “tyranny in disguise”. The spat unfolded as the US continued its crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech, with nine activists arrested at an encampment at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.</p>

The idea, initiated by San Francisco Democrats in a resolution, will be considered by the statewide party when it holds its convention later this month.
