          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:59:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new political party. This follows the announcement by ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she is leaving the party to co-lead a new left-wing movement with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's decision and stated that the foundations for a "new kind of political party" are taking shape. These talks aim to formalize the group of independent, pro-Gaza MPs coordinated by Corbyn into an official party, potentially to contest local elections next year. The development signals a significant shift on the UK's political left, challenging the current Labour leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 08:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top European Union and German officials have proposed that the EU lead the formation of a new global trade body to function as an alternative to the struggling World Trade Organization (WTO). The initiative, floated by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, addresses the paralysis of the WTO's dispute resolution system, which has been blocked by the U.S. for years. The proposed organization would focus on partnerships with like-minded nations, potentially by joining the CPTPP trade bloc, and would initially exclude the U.S. and China. The goal is to liberalize trade and enforce fair competition rules, though some business groups caution against splintering the global trade system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump held a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the congressional passage of his massive tax and policy proposal, which he dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” He touted the legislation as delivering the largest tax and spending cuts in U.S. history. During the event, Trump also previewed plans for next year's "America 250" celebration, announcing a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a national sporting event for high school athletes. He also referenced recent U.S. strikes on Iran, describing the past two weeks as highly successful for his administration and recounting a conversation where Iranian officials purportedly gave him a respectful warning before a counterstrike.</p>

          <p>Animal rights organization PETA has announced plans to protest at the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, coinciding with the return of competitive eating champion Joey Chestnut. PETA activists intend to distribute vegan hot dogs to spectators, promoting an "animal-friendly" Fourth of July celebration. Chestnut is making his comeback to the Coney Island event after being temporarily banned over a sponsorship deal with a plant-based food company. In a previous contest, Chestnut famously subdued a protester who rushed the stage, highlighting the potential for confrontations at the high-profile event. He remains the overwhelming favorite to win his 17th title.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign a sweeping budget bill that makes significant changes to U.S. fiscal and social policy after a contentious passage through Congress. Key provisions include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, which primarily benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, and increasing the standard deduction. The bill also enacts steep cuts and new work requirements for Medicaid, potentially leaving millions without health coverage. Furthermore, it boosts defense and immigration enforcement funding, cuts food benefits under the SNAP program, and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. The legislation passed despite internal Republican disputes and unified Democratic opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan reportedly involves a 60-day truce, the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli withdrawal from parts of Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations continue across the Gaza Strip, with recent overnight strikes in Khan Younis killing at least 15 people. In Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages held a rally urging the Israeli government to accept a deal that would secure the release of their loved ones and lead to a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The United States is approaching a July 9 deadline, after which a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs against numerous countries is set to expire, creating significant economic uncertainty. If new trade deals are not reached, country-specific duties could be added to the existing 10% baseline tariff, potentially triggering inflation and harming businesses. The Trump administration has announced new agreements with the UK, China, and Vietnam but has not indicated plans to extend the deadline for others. Experts speculate that the administration may grant extensions to countries negotiating in good faith while allowing tariffs to snap back for others, prolonging uncertainty for the global economy.

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of unusually large 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site. Eight of the discovered shoes are over 30cm long, with one measuring nearly 13 inches, equivalent to a modern US size 15. This proportion of large footwear is significantly higher than at other Roman sites, puzzling researchers. The shoes were found preserved in an old defensive ditch, which the Romans often used as a garbage dump. Scientists are now investigating which military regiments were stationed at Magna to understand why so many large-footed individuals might have been present there.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the contradictions of celebrating the Fourth of July at a time when American democracy and freedoms feel increasingly under threat. The authors, three legal professionals, argue that marginalized communities have always recognized the gap between America's ideals and its reality. They contend that the nation is witnessing a dangerous backslide with the erosion of civil rights and the stoking of racial division. Instead of despair, they call for grassroots action and community engagement to defend and transform democracy from the ground up. The piece advocates for a "radical hope" and collective effort to build a more inclusive nation that lives up to its promises.</p>

Without passports for their children, these parents face the risk of family separation or rendering their children stateless if they are forced to leave the country.

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic franchise, 'Jurassic World Rebirth,' attempts to reset the series but ultimately delivers a plodding and uninspired experience. Directed by Gareth Edwards, the film returns to a remote island setting where mercenaries and a shipwrecked family encounter dinosaurs. While the movie boasts impressive scale and clear action sequences, it suffers from a lack of compelling characters and a recycled plot reminiscent of earlier sequels. The ensemble cast, including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, is wasted on rote dialogue. The review concludes that the film adds more roaring dinosaurs but no narrative stakes, existing mainly as a summer blockbuster cash-in.</p>

          <p>This historical essay argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, played a crucial role in building the foundations of a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. Before the war, the colonies were disparate and competitive, lacking a shared culture. The army created this identity by establishing national symbols like a new flag, replacing the King's birthday with celebrations for Washington, and fostering a sense of shared purpose through common hardship and sacrifice. After the war, veterans continued this nation-building project through organizations like the Society of the Cincinnati and by advocating for a strong federal government, believing it essential to preserve the republic they fought to create.</p>

          <p>This essay explores a contemporary feminist reading of Virginia Woolf's seminal work, "A Room of One's Own." The author recounts her initial reluctance to read the book, viewing it as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism, but later found a deep connection with Woolf's arguments about the necessity of financial and personal independence for women's creativity. The article draws parallels between Woolf's 1928 observations and today's world, noting persistent issues like the gender pay gap and the dismissal of women's stories. While acknowledging the book's historical limitations, the author argues that Woolf's core ideas about economic control and intellectual freedom remain profoundly relevant and intersectional.</p>

          <p>China has issued a stern warning to India, urging it to stop using Tibet-related issues to interfere in Beijing's internal affairs. The statement from China's foreign ministry came in response to comments from an Indian minister regarding the succession of the Dalai Lama. Beijing reiterated its stance that the succession process must adhere to Chinese law and tradition. A ministry spokeswoman called on India to recognize the "anti-China and separatist nature" of the Dalai Lama and honor its commitments on Tibetan matters. The exchange highlights the ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two neighboring powers over the sensitive issue of Tibet.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's extensive budget bill has intensified concerns among analysts about the long-term trajectory of U.S. national debt and the stability of the dollar. The legislation is set to raise the federal debt ceiling by $5 trillion, allowing for greater government borrowing but also accelerating debt accumulation. According to one analyst, investors were already seeking to diversify away from U.S. dollar assets even before the bill's passage. This new fiscal measure could further fuel momentum in countries looking to reduce their exposure to the U.S. currency amid worries over its reliability as a safe-haven asset.

          <p>A year after returning to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is facing significant headwinds, with his popularity falling amid unfulfilled economic promises. The government's primary mission to boost growth has stalled, as high inflation and borrowing costs continue to pressure households and businesses. With little fiscal room to maneuver, Chancellor Rachel Reeves may be forced to consider tax hikes in the next budget. Concurrently, the rival Reform UK party is gaining in the polls, reflecting public disaffection. While the government has secured several international trade deals, these successes have not been enough to reverse the challenging domestic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The move comes after reports of commercial tour operators conducting "disaster tours" to profit from the devastation caused by a recent wildfire that destroyed over 6,000 structures and killed 12 people. Councilmember Traci Park, who introduced the motion, called the practice "gross" and dangerous, as it could interfere with ongoing debris-clearing and recovery operations. The ban will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency response, with the city also considering permanent restrictions on large buses in the area's narrow, winding streets.</p>

          <p>A targeted drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and at least fourteen others wounded. The attack occurred late Wednesday night as a crowd was leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police report that occupants of a dark vehicle fired into the group, with victims ranging from 21 to 32 years old. Authorities believe the shooting was a targeted attack, possibly gang-related, and are preparing for potential retaliation.

Officials cited a lack of funding and stalled progress as reasons for the decision, leaving the 800-hectare site near Mbodiène mostly empty.

The national civil aviation authority requested airlines to cancel 40% of flights at Paris airports and up to 50% at other major hubs like Nice. The strike, led by unions demanding more staff to handle surging air travel and better pay to combat inflation, affects all flights over French airspace. Low-cost carrier Ryanair alone canceled over 400 flights, impacting an estimated 70,000 passengers.</p>

          <p>A new Republican-led budget bill contains over $1 trillion in federal cuts to Medicaid, which experts warn will severely impact healthcare access, particularly in rural America. The cuts could force states that recently expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, like North Carolina, to end their programs due to "trigger laws." This would leave millions of low-income and disabled residents uninsured. Healthcare providers in rural areas, already operating on thin margins, could face closures, as they rely heavily on Medicaid to serve their communities. The cuts are part of a broader bill that also delivers large tax cuts favoring the wealthy.</p>

          <p>A rare, handwritten letter from Thomas Jefferson, previously thought to be lost, has been discovered and is being offered for sale. Penned in 1783, the letter discusses the right of citizens to bear arms in the context of revolutionary movements spreading across Europe. Jefferson expresses support for Dutch citizens demanding rights against their rulers, noting that nearly all who are able to bear arms are joining the cause. The document provides a unique insight into Jefferson's views on armed citizenry as a check on autocratic power, linking the American Revolution to broader democratic fervor.

Researchers tested water upstream and downstream from 32 sites across the country, finding significantly higher PFAS levels downstream in 95% of cases. The practice of spreading sludge as agricultural fertilizer, known as "biosolids," is highlighted as a key pathway for re-polluting water and introducing toxins into the food supply.

The author argues that streaming culture has conditioned listeners to prefer innocuous, vibe-based background music over active, engaged listening. AI-generated music, with its generic lyrics and blended genres, perfectly serves this purpose, becoming a kind of aesthetically and morally neutral sonic wallpaper. The article suggests that as music becomes a tool to simply fill silence or create an atmosphere, the distinction between human and machine-made art becomes increasingly irrelevant to many listeners, signaling a profound shift in our relationship with music.</p>

Envisioned by then-CEO Michael Eisner, the park aimed to present a serious and unflinching look at U.S. history, including slavery and the Civil War, in an entertainment format. The proposal sparked a massive culture war, drawing opposition from historians, environmentalists, and locals concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history and its proximity to the Manassas battlefield. The intense public and political backlash, including congressional hearings, eventually led Disney to abandon the project, which serves as a precursor to today's ongoing battles over how American history is told.</p>

However, the deal's scant details have left economists questioning how it will be enforced, particularly how officials will define "made in Vietnam" versus a transshipment. The agreement makes Vietnam the latest nation to secure some trade relief ahead of a looming U.S. tariff deadline and is seen as a model for pressuring China in future trade negotiations.
