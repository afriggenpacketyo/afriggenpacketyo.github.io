          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor contract with Samsung Electronics, a deal set to run until the end of 2033. Musk stated that Samsung's new Texas facility will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, highlighting the strategic importance of the partnership. He also indicated the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure, as Tesla will assist in optimizing manufacturing efficiency. Following the news, Samsung's shares saw a significant rise in trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework trade agreement, averting further tariff escalations. The deal sets a 15% tariff rate on most EU goods, a reduction from the 30% threatened by President Trump, but still a significant increase from pre-existing levels. European leaders and analysts have expressed concern that the agreement is unbalanced and puts the EU at a disadvantage, despite providing temporary stability. Uncertainty remains as many details, particularly concerning the steel and pharmaceutical sectors, are still under negotiation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Nurses' Union Poised to Reject Pay Offer, Raising Prospect of Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 02:54:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to announce an overwhelming rejection of the government's 3.6% pay award this week. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque" for being lower than increases given to other public sector workers. This rejection, following a consultative vote with high turnout, raises the possibility of a formal ballot for strike action later in the year. The RCN is urging ministers to enter negotiations over the summer to avoid industrial action, a call echoed by the GMB union, which also recently rejected the pay deal.</p>

          <p>The new US-EU trade framework is being hailed as a significant political win for President Donald Trump, who secured a 15% tariff on many European goods. While this is a major concession from the EU, which had aimed for zero tariffs, it avoids the threatened 30% rate and brings some level of certainty to a tense trade relationship. In return, the EU has agreed to open its markets to some American exports and purchase billions in US energy and arms. Analysts describe the deal as asymmetric, noting it could have been worse for the EU but still represents a challenging outcome for international trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has praised a new trade agreement with the European Union as a "powerful deal" that will see the EU increase spending on US energy products. The announcement came after a meeting in Scotland with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In other administration-related news, US House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed hesitation about the idea of granting a pardon to Ghislaine Maxwell. Another Republican suggested a pardon could be considered if it helped obtain more information about the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material as part of a major investigation called Operation Grayskull. The network had over 120,000 members and hosted millions of illicit files. The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or utilized the sites, including a key administrator who was sentenced to life in prison. Officials described the takedown as one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat rising violence in prisons, the UK government is launching a trial to issue Tasers to specially trained staff in men's facilities in England and Wales. The pilot follows new data showing over £20 million has been paid in compensation for assaults in prisons over the past five years. The Tasers will be used by a specialist unit responding to serious incidents like riots or hostage situations. While the Prison Officers' Association has long called for the measure, some critics worry about the risks if the weapons were rolled out more widely.</p>

          <h2>Tariff Simulator Projects Significant Drop in US Imports Following EU Trade Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:04:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity forecasts a dramatic reconfiguration of global trade following the new US-EU trade deal. The model predicts that total global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent years, while U.S. exports may rise by 12%. The 15% tariff framework is expected to cause the U.S. to import less from countries like China, Canada, and Mexico, who may in turn rewire their trade relationships away from America. Logistics experts warn that the tariffs will make many products more expensive. (not investment advice)</p>
