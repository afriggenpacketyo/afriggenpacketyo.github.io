While initial consumer interest and preorders appear strong, the launch comes at a critical time for the company.

          <p>A drone strike attributed to Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed dozens of civilians at a mosque in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people in North Darfur. Medical and aid groups reported casualties ranging from 43 to 75 people in what was described as a "horrific massacre." The attack is part of the RSF's ongoing offensive to seize control of El-Fasher, the last army-held city in the Darfur region. The incident underscores the escalating violence in Sudan's forgotten war and its devastating impact on civilians.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are attempting to reverse several key health protections related to toxic PFAS "forever chemical" pollution from U.S. military bases.

The decision to invite the controversial leader was made by the British government, but the Queen made her disapproval clear.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that while the navy has a working relationship with the UK Border Force, the military's primary focus must remain on national defense and key global issues. The comments were made during Trump's state visit and as the UK government began implementing a new "one in, one out" migrant return agreement with France.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation has revealed significant problems within Walmart's third-party online marketplace, including the sale of counterfeit goods and sellers operating with stolen business identities. The report suggests that in its aggressive push to expand its e-commerce platform and compete with Amazon, Walmart relaxed its seller vetting standards, creating an environment where bad actors could thrive. This has led to shoppers receiving fake and potentially unsafe products, particularly in categories like health supplements and beauty, betraying consumer trust in the Walmart brand.</p>

          <p>A federal vaccine advisory committee for the CDC has voted to alter its recommendation for the MMRV vaccine, a combination shot for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. The panel now advises that children under the age of four should receive the MMR and chickenpox vaccines as two separate shots instead of the single combined dose. This change, which awaits final approval from the CDC director, could affect insurance coverage for the combination shot and came during a meeting noted for its contentious debate over established vaccine science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years since the pandemic began, experts are clarifying why COVID-19 can cause vastly different reactions even among healthy individuals. A primary factor is the initial viral load; being exposed to a higher concentration of the virus can lead to a more severe illness, akin to a larger initial invasion force. Additionally, a person's immune history, shaped by vaccinations and previous exposures, plays a crucial role in how effectively their body can fight off the infection. While new variants continue to emerge, the virus is showing a more predictable seasonal pattern similar to the flu.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded with a furious statement after a federal appeals court ruled that his imposition of sweeping, across-the-board tariffs was illegal. Trump claimed the decision, if upheld, would "literally destroy the United States of America." The court determined that the president had overstepped his authority, emphasizing that the Constitution grants Congress, not the executive branch, the power to impose tariffs. The administration is appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court, with the controversial tariffs remaining in effect for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by artificial intelligence and information overload, the president of Dartmouth College argues that the residential university experience is more vital than ever. The article contends that the core purpose of higher education is not merely to transfer knowledge but to teach students how to think and to cultivate essential human skills like critical thinking, empathy, and collaborative leadership. These qualities, it asserts, are best developed through direct, face-to-face dialogue and debate, which are increasingly threatened by the isolating nature of social media and AI.</p>

The court rejected a last-minute attempt to block the removal, ruling that France is a safe country and that the deportation was in the public interest as part of a policy to disrupt criminal smuggling operations. This case marks the first legally contested removal under the new scheme, which aims to deter small boat crossings of the English Channel.</p>
