Despite the loss, Messi displayed moments of his signature skill, earning praise from commentators for his clever play.

The resignation was reportedly submitted to resolve demands related to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Warner stated the threat was explicit, warning that if Ryan did not resign by a specific deadline, the university would face significant funding cuts affecting employees and students.

In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, suggesting that many politicians prioritize political points over the welfare of their constituents.

          <p>The public discourse over the effectiveness of the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities highlights the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA). Historically, from World War II to the first Gulf War, determining the true impact of airstrikes has been challenging, involving factors like munition precision, delivery aircraft, and the type of damage inflicted. Modern precision-guided weapons have significantly improved accuracy, but assessing functional and indirect effects remains difficult without on-the-ground intelligence. Experts suggest that a full assessment of the Iran strikes will take time, but initial educated guesses indicate the damage to Iran's nuclear ecosystem was likely severe and lasting.</p>

          <p>A new assessment from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the Senate's version of President Trump's budget bill could leave nearly 12 million Americans without healthcare and add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt. The report is expected to complicate the Republican effort to pass the legislation, which narrowly cleared a procedural vote. The bill's proposed $1 trillion cut to healthcare funding, particularly to Medicaid, has become a central point of contention for both Democrats and some concerned Republicans, like Senator Thom Tillis, who recently announced his retirement.

A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes President Xi Jinping is likely to grant.

          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, formed on Sunday off Mexico's Atlantic and Pacific coasts, respectively, threatening the region with heavy rainfall. Tropical Storm Barry, located in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall in southeastern Mexico, bringing three to six inches of rain and prompting a tropical storm warning. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie formed in the Pacific and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane, though it is expected to remain offshore. Flossie is still projected to bring significant rainfall to several southwestern Mexican states through the early week.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing U.S. intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the damage from recent U.S. military strikes on their nuclear program. This account raises further questions about the actual extent of the damage, contrasting with President Trump's claims that the facilities were "obliterated." While a source confirmed the intercepts to Reuters, they also cautioned that the Iranian officials may not have been truthful, deeming the communications unreliable. The White House dismissed the report, reiterating its confidence that Iran's nuclear weapons program is now over.</p>

The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and announced the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service.

Despite knowing about this vulnerability for over 15 years, successive administrations have failed to create a coherent strategy to build independent supply chains. China's recent export controls and invasive licensing requirements, which demand sensitive company data, are described as a form of "competitive surveillance."

He argued that while the bill contains some popular provisions, its negative impacts on health insurance access, rural hospitals, and food assistance will ultimately harm Republicans politically.

Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling.

          <p>Lakers superstar LeBron James will make NBA history by returning for his 23rd season, breaking a tie with Vince Carter for the most seasons played. James exercised his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season. At 40 years old, James is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played in a career.

In a Fox News interview, Trump stated that reporters and their sources could face prosecution if they do not comply, framing the issue as a matter of national security. The leaked assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggested the strikes had only limited success, a conclusion that contradicts the administration's public claims of having "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program.
