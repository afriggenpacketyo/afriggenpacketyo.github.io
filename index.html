          <p>Victims of the January 6th Capitol riot and Democratic lawmakers are accusing the Trump administration of hypocrisy in its response to recent protests in Los Angeles compared to the events of January 6th. Former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn and others point to the contrast between the administration's condemnation of those who allegedly assaulted police in Los Angeles and their defense of individuals who attacked officers during the Capitol siege. Democrats also highlight Trump's swift deployment of the National Guard to California, despite his delayed response to the Capitol attack. Critics argue that Trump's rhetoric and actions reveal a double standard, where the law is applied differently to his allies and adversaries. Optimism in the situation is low due to the perceived hypocrisy and potential for escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom, White House "border czar" Tom Homan clarified that there is "no intention to arrest" Newsom at this time. The administration and Newsom have been at odds over the handling of protests in Los Angeles sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. Homan stated that arrests would only be considered if officials impede ICE operations, leaving the decision to the Justice Department. The situation underscores the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement and the deployment of federal forces. The overall tone suggests a volatile political climate.</p>

Roger Ford, a local energy startup president, laments the departure of the region's best and brightest and the struggles of those left behind. The region, once a hub of coal mining, has suffered economic losses, leading to a sense that modern Democrats have failed to address their concerns. Despite voting overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2024, many residents acknowledge that his promises have not materialized.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated rice prices. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to take action.

The government insists that nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though the project will take at least a decade to complete.

          <p>A group of cross-party MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" with "fundamental flaws." A report by the Women and Equalities Committee states that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes." The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. The current system allows most new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report highlights that paternity leave has not changed noticeably since its introduction more than two decades ago. The need for reform is evident.</p>

The training materials state that teachers can use AI to "help automate routine tasks" and focus on "quality face-to-face time." Teachers should be transparent about their use of AI and always check its results. AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking such as quizzes or homework. The guidance aims to support teachers in utilizing AI effectively. The implementation of AI may have a positive impact on education.</p>
