          <p>Elon Musk acknowledged a challenging position, expressing reluctance to publicly oppose the Trump administration while also disclaiming responsibility for all its policies after a four-month stint leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk defended his record in government, noting DOGE's role in cutting federal jobs, but voiced concerns over the GOP's spending package and its potential impact on national debt. He stated the spending bill undermines DOGE's work, revealing a difference in opinion with the administration. Musk's departure from DOGE comes amid debate over government spending and economic policy.</p>

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people and numerous injuries, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witness accounts. Witnesses reported gunfire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denied its forces were involved. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated it delivered aid without incident and dismissed reports of casualties, but previous GHF distributions have been marred by chaos and claims of Israeli troops firing on crowds. The incident occurred amid faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with both sides trading blame.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that "tariffs are not going away," despite a federal court ruling that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the duties. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would uphold Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration argues that overturning the tariffs would undermine his negotiating leverage with other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Scottish men, Eddie Lyons Jnr and Ross Monaghan, with links to a Glasgow-based criminal gang, were shot dead at a bar in Fuengirola, Spain. A masked gunman opened fire at Monaghans Bar, killing both men before fleeing in a vehicle. Monaghan had previously been acquitted of a gangland murder and was himself shot in 2017. Police Scotland is directing inquiries to Spanish authorities, and the shooting may be connected to drug crime.</p>
