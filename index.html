          <p>A California family is suing Harrison-Ross Mortuary after they discovered the wrong body dressed in their uncle's clothes in his casket. Amentha Hunt noticed the error when preparing her uncle, Otis Adkinson, for burial, but was initially dismissed by a mortuary worker. The family waited three hours for the mortuary to correct the mix-up. The funeral home denies the allegations, and the family's attorney emphasizes the mortuary's failure to meet basic standards of care. Hunt says she remains traumatized by the incident.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists are working to solve the mystery of a dinosaur mass grave at Pipestone Creek in Alberta, Canada, nicknamed the 'River of Death.' The site contains thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus bones, believed to be from a herd that died in a catastrophic event 72 million years ago. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were migrating when a flash flood struck, killing a large portion of the herd. The site is one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique opportunity to study dinosaur biology and community structure.</p>

China leads in industries like steel, electric vehicles, and 5G equipment, with projections showing they will account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030.

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russian forces are increasing their military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move that could signal Moscow's post-Ukraine war strategy. New construction includes tents, warehouses, and renovated fighter jet shelters. NATO officials say this buildup is not comparable to the pre-invasion buildup on the Ukraine border. Finland, a recent NATO member, shares an 830-mile border with Russia, which military analysts predict could become a hot spot.</p>

          <p>Sergei Lebedev argues that Russia's aggression in Ukraine mirrors the Soviet Union's occupation of Eastern Europe, marked by violence, oppression, and the erasure of national identity. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the Soviet occupation as a crime to comprehend the fears of Russia's neighbors and ensure European security. Russia's tactics include imposing citizenship, confiscating property, reversing memory politics, and employing filtration techniques. The article calls for a coordinated effort to counter Russia's narratives and strengthen unity in Europe.</p>
