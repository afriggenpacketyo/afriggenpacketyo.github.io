          <p>A boat capsized on Lake Tahoe, resulting in eight fatalities after the body of the last missing person was recovered. The 27-foot Chris-Craft boat capsized due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park, initially reporting six adults dead, two rescued, and two missing. The search covered over 390 square miles before the final body was found. A sudden storm with high winds contributed to the dangerous conditions, highlighting the importance of boating preparedness, including having a radio, life vests, and boating knowledge, as conditions can change rapidly and unexpectedly on Lake Tahoe.

          <p>Florida will receive federal funds to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the facilities would be funded largely by FEMA's shelter and services program, expanding capacity for holding detainees awaiting deportation. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said the "Alligator Alcatraz" facility, a repurposed airfield, could house immigrants with criminal records, with no escape due to the surrounding wetlands. This initiative is part of a broader effort by Republican-led states to aid the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, expanding immigration arrests with the help of law enforcement in states like Louisiana, Texas, and Florida.

          <p>Florida officials have petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law criminalizing unlawful entry into Florida. Attorney General James Uthmeier seeks to halt a federal judge's decision that deemed the law likely unconstitutional. The law, known as SB 4-C, aims to help the Trump administration curb illegal immigration by mirroring federal law, but it has faced legal challenges arguing it is preempted by federal statutes. Uthmeier defends the law as a necessary measure to protect Florida's citizens from the harms of illegal immigration, citing state lawmakers' concerns over the issue.

The government says it will provide more help for children with communication challenges through its Plan for Change, but the charity advocates for better training for teachers, school staff, and mental health professionals to identify and support these children early.

The three liberal justices dissented, calling it a "gross abuse" and saying it was "rewarding lawlessness". The Department of Homeland Security said the ruling was "a victory for the safety and security of the American people."</p>

While the market has considered this threat for over 20 years, Iran has never actually closed it, and oil prices dropped on Monday, indicating the market's skepticism. Braziel also noted that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
