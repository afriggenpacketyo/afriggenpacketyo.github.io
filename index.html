          <p>Tanzania's main opposition party, CHADEMA, reports the arrest of several members en route to a rally supporting their leader, Tundu Lissu, who faces treason charges. The party accuses President Samia Suluhu Hassan of authoritarian tactics reminiscent of her predecessor, John Magufuli. Lissu's arrest and trial come amid increasing government targeting of the opposition ahead of upcoming elections. Amnesty International has condemned the government's actions as a campaign of repression, citing heavy-handed tactics to silence critics.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Attempt to Require Citizenship Proof for Voter Registration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 14:20:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, arguing that the Constitution grants Congress and the states, not the President, the power to regulate federal elections. Judge Kollar-Kotelly's ruling prevents the administration from unilaterally reshaping election processes through executive orders. The decision also halts a provision requiring government agencies to assess citizenship before providing voter registration forms to public assistance enrollees. This ruling is a victory for voter registration groups and Democrats challenging Trump's executive order, which aimed to enforce election protections but was criticized for potentially disenfranchising millions of eligible voters.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has lowered its full-year outlook, citing a decline in consumer spending and the impact of increasing global tariffs. The company, which manufactures Pepsi, Gatorade, Doritos, and Cheetos, reported a decrease in revenue and net income for the recent quarter. According to PepsiCo's CFO, there is growing concern regarding consumer sentiment compared to three months prior.

          <p>Existing home sales in March experienced a significant drop of 5.9% from February, marking the largest monthly decline since November 2022, signaling a continued slump in the housing market. High mortgage rates are cited as a major factor, with rates climbing in recent weeks due to President Trump's tariff threats impacting bond markets. Despite increased inventory, sales remain lower compared to the previous year, suggesting less economic mobility as people stay in their current homes. New home sales, however, present a brighter picture, increasing by 7.4% from February, driven by homebuilders constructing smaller, more affordable homes.</p>

          <p>Meta has acknowledged that Facebook's feed is plagued with spammy posts and plans to crack down on the worst offenders by reducing the reach of creators who share posts with long, irrelevant captions. The company is also taking more aggressive steps to combat spam networks that coordinate fake engagement and testing a feature for users to anonymously downvote comments. This update comes as Meta aims to revamp Facebook to attract younger users, but it does not specifically address the issue of AI-generated content designed to farm engagement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering investing in companies that mine and process critical minerals to reduce U.S. dependence on imports from countries like China. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested the U.S. could use a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners, competing against China's state-backed investments. This move comes after Beijing imposed export controls on rare earth elements in retaliation for President Trump's tariff hikes. The administration is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies investing in approved projects.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in March fell 5.9% from February to 4.02 million units, marking the slowest March sales pace since 2009.

Despite a sharp increase in available listings, sales remained sluggish, with the West experiencing the hardest hit. Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, noted that the sluggishness signals the troublesome possibility of less economic mobility for society.</p>
