        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation reveals that ticket touts, who buy tickets in bulk and resell them at inflated prices, allegedly received assistance from staff at major ticketing firms. Former employees at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claim they worked closely with touts, and court documents show some staff even bought tickets for them. Touts allegedly received financial incentives and were offered meetings with top Ticketmaster lawyers to help them. Ticketmaster denies the allegations, stating they refer to long-defunct businesses and have no relevance to today's ticketing landscape. The article highlights how this alleged collusion may have short-changed fans and undermined efforts to combat ticket touting. </p>

          <p>South Korea has ceased its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking a step towards easing tensions. The decision, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has not yet commented on the move, but the South hopes this will encourage dialogue after years of heightened tensions. This action follows Lee's campaign promise to halt the broadcasts, which had caused discomfort for South Korean residents near the border, and is seen as a proactive effort to reduce military tensions.</p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan has criticized the decision to drop the misconduct investigation into a Met Police officer who led an inquiry into false sexual abuse claims against her late husband, Lord Leon Brittan.

Lady Brittan expressed a loss of trust in the Met and the police watchdog, citing a "complete lack of professionalism."

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert has posted satellite images of a suspected new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The images, taken in April, support earlier reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding the construction of a new structure with features similar to an existing enrichment plant. The facility includes a large central hall where centrifuges could be installed, surrounded by support spaces. This development raises concerns about North Korea's ongoing nuclear activities and its potential to expand its production of enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul is criticizing the White House for "immaturity" after he and his family were disinvited from the annual White House picnic. The move came after Paul raised concerns about President Trumpâ€™s sweeping policy bill, specifically the increase of the national debt limit. Paul described the White House's action as "petty vindictiveness" and expressed a loss of respect for Trump. He also took aim at White House aide Stephen Miller, accusing him of casually discussing the suspension of habeas corpus. Paul said that his wife, Kelley, along with his son, daughter-in-law and infant grandson were all planning on attending the event.</p>
