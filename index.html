          <p>Forensic tests have confirmed that human remains found on a remote mountain in Washington state belong to Travis Decker, who was wanted for the murder of his three young daughters. Decker, a former soldier with survival training, had been the subject of a three-month search after his daughters, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found suffocated at a campsite in June. The Chelan County Sheriff's Office expressed regret to the girls' mother for the time taken to resolve the case. Authorities are continuing efforts to determine the exact cause and time of Decker's death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since early April, outperforming rivals and shifting focus away from previous takeover speculation. This improved sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, a leadership change, progress in cost-cutting, and recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized growth, and the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. Analysts note the selection of a new chair with turnaround experience as a significant catalyst, further reinforcing BP's position as it doubles down on hydrocarbon exploration and development.</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger, Reform UK's newest MP, has refuted claims of a 'pensioner deportation programme' under his party's proposals to abolish indefinite leave to remain. Kruger, who recently defected from the Conservatives, stated that while the party aims to prioritize UK citizens and culture, long-term residents would be encouraged to apply for British citizenship. He controversially argued that Muslim immigration poses a threat to UK culture and criticized the suppression of 'legitimate concerns' regarding migration. The article highlights the party's stance on ending indefinite leave to remain to curb what it perceives as mass migration.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart is content with the declining resale prices of its popular Labubu monster toys, stating that the crash aligns with its goal of making art accessible to genuine collectors. Resale markups previously soared, reaching over 2,000% for some editions, attracting scalpers and even leading to a $30,000 heist. The company has significantly increased production, now churning out 30 million plush toys monthly, ten times last year's volume. Pop Mart aims for a sustainable model that fosters connection with the art rather than solely profit-driven purchases, while also expanding globally and investing in animation.</p>

          <p>Denmark's critical infrastructure, including airports and military bases across Jutland, has been exposed as vulnerable following a series of drone incidents. While no harm or damage occurred, the events highlight a national security challenge in an era of hybrid warfare. Defence chiefs opted not to shoot down drones due to safety concerns, but this is not a long-term solution. Denmark, a NATO member, is considering invoking Article 4 for consultation, with officials defining the incidents as a 'hybrid attack' possibly linked to Russia, despite Moscow's denials.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, clarified that pregnant women should take Tylenol if advised by a doctor, especially for fevers, despite President Trump's recent comments on a potential link to autism. Oz emphasized that acetaminophen remains the safest option for treating fevers during pregnancy, which can pose health risks. While an FDA commissioner's letter mentioned an association between acetaminophen and autism, it explicitly stated no causal relationship has been established. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, strongly advise against avoiding acetaminophen without physician consultation, fearing women might turn to less safe alternatives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a memorandum aimed at combating 'domestic terrorism,' which critics fear could lead to a broad crackdown on his political opponents. Trump suggested targeting figures like George Soros and Reid Hoffman, whom he claims fund 'lunatics.' The initiative, presented as a comprehensive strategy against organized political violence, involves the FBI, Justice Department, and Treasury Department. Civil liberties groups, like the ACLU, warn this move could stigmatize non-profits and activists, echoing historical targeting of civil rights leaders. The article highlights concerns about the administration's politicization of law enforcement and its potential impact on free speech.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by loud commercials, aims to regulate streaming service ad volumes, potentially impacting nationwide practices. Federal law already governs broadcast TV ad loudness, but streaming services are currently exempt. The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, seeks to close this loophole, asserting California's power to set a national standard due to its market size. Despite unanimous state Senate passage, the Motion Picture Association is fighting the bill, citing challenges for independent streamers. The article highlights the consumer frustration over jarring ad volumes and the legislative effort to address it.</p>

          <p>U.S. country music megastar Luke Combs observes significant differences in British country music fans compared to his American audience, as the genre experiences rapid growth in the UK.

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the hurricane season, is currently swirling north of the Caribbean and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane. Meteorologists are monitoring a second developing storm nearby, raising the possibility of a Fujiwhara effect, where two storms merge or orbit each other. While unlikely to result in a dramatic 'dance' due to Humberto's stronger nature, any interaction could slightly alter their paths. The article explains this rare meteorological phenomenon and its potential implications for the southeastern U.S. coast, which could face downstream impacts from these systems.</p>
