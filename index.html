          <p>A CNBC investigation reveals a surge in cargo theft targeting the U.S. supply chain, with criminals exploiting technology to steal valuable products from trucks, warehouses, and trains. Strategic theft, involving deceptive tactics to divert cargo or payments, is increasingly common, with losses estimated to be near $1 billion annually. Experts say the lack of deterrents and the low risk/high reward nature of the crime contribute to the problem, impacting consumers through retail price increases. Companies are investing in technology and security measures to combat theft, but the challenge persists due to the sophistication and global reach of criminal networks.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate detained by immigration authorities after her student visa was revoked, is undergoing a bail hearing. The Trump administration revoked her student visa, and her lawyers argue her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. Ozturk, who co-authored an opinion piece critical of Tufts' stance on Israel, alleges she has suffered multiple asthma attacks in ICE detention due to poor conditions and limited medical attention. Tufts' president has defended Ozturk, and her lawyers are urging the court to grant her bail, citing significant health risks and the implications for academic freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning to expedite the resettlement of white South Africans, classified as refugees, to the United States, while refugee admissions remain largely suspended for others. The administration claims Afrikaners face racial persecution in South Africa, a claim disputed by the South African government. This initiative contrasts sharply with the slower processing times for refugees from other regions. The resettlement is being funded through the Department of Health and Human Services, and refugee advocates have criticized the administration's prioritization of Afrikaners over other vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and U.K. reached a trade agreement that suggests a 10% baseline tariff will likely remain for most trading partners under President Trump's administration. While the U.K. secured some sector-specific tariff reductions for autos, steel, and aluminum, most other goods will still be subject to the baseline tariff.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to raise the cost of baby products by up to $1,000 a year for new parents, according to industry players. The tariffs, particularly on goods from China where most baby essentials are manufactured, are already leading to price increases on items like car seats and strollers. Advocates are calling for exemptions on critical baby products to alleviate the financial burden on families. The rising costs are also driving more parents to resale platforms in search of affordable options.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is moving forward with a plan to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza through private companies, a move that has drawn criticism from the UN, who say they will not cooperate. The US claims that this new system is necessary to prevent Hamas from stealing aid, but the UN says they already have strong supervisory mechanisms in place. The UN has also expressed concern that the private distribution hubs are designed to displace Gazans, and that the amount of aid being proposed is significantly less than what is needed.</p>

          <p>As the Philippines prepares for midterm elections, many young voters are expressing a desire to end the concentration of political power among long-entrenched dynasties. These dynasties are often linked to poverty and underdevelopment, with power concentrated within families across different government functions. Despite constitutional prohibitions, term limits are evaded by helping family members get elected, leading to calls for enforcing the ban on political dynasties and promoting leadership that represents the needs of all Filipinos.</p>

          <p>The fate of the Indian Premier League (IPL) restart hinges on the "mood of the nation," with the potential absence of overseas players adding complexity. Most of the 10 England players are leaving India, while the Australians involved are also likely to depart. If a short-term restart is not possible, there would an overwhelming desire to complete the tournament later in the year because of its financial value. Long-term questions linger over future matches between India and Pakistan due to escalating tensions.</p>
