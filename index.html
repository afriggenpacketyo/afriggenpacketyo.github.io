          <p>Experts at a tech conference emphasized the need for nations to build "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. Many current prominent AI models are English-based, creating a dependency on foreign technology and perspectives. Panelists suggested that emerging economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, can leverage open-source models and cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services to democratize access and foster their own AI ecosystems. This approach helps create a collective energy for innovation and ensures technological benefits are more inclusively distributed globally.</p>

          <p>A coalition of six California Republican state legislators has formally requested that the Trump administration redirect its immigration enforcement efforts. They argue that current widespread ICE raids are creating fear, disrupting key industries like construction and hospitality, and arresting many non-criminal individuals. In a letter to the president, the lawmakers urged a focus on deporting violent criminals while also streamlining legal guest worker programs to address labor shortages. They contend this approach would better serve public safety and the state's economy.</p>

          <p>A 69-year-old woman was arrested in Merced County, California, on 93 counts of animal cruelty after authorities discovered 134 cats inside a U-Haul van. A deputy found the van in a Taco Bell parking lot, with many cats visibly in distress and pressed against the windshield on a 100-degree day. Inside, officials found 106 living but emaciated cats and 28 deceased ones, with no food or water available.

The sanctions, which bar him from entering China, Hong Kong, and Macau, were announced after his term as a lawmaker ended. Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which asserts Manila's claims in the South China Sea, and he also led investigations into alleged Chinese espionage.

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers saw a surprising return to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, largely driven by an increase in new export orders. This contrasts with the official government PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, though the two surveys poll different types of firms. The resilience is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has passed significant housing legislation aimed at accelerating construction by easing environmental regulations under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Governor Gavin Newsom championed the bills, even using a "poison pill" provision in the state budget to ensure their passage despite opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. The new laws exempt most urban housing projects from CEQA review and streamline the process for other developments, a move experts call one of the most consequential reforms to the 55-year-old environmental law. Proponents believe this will unlock numerous stalled housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>The White House asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump by agreeing to rescind a proposed digital services tax on large U.S. tech companies. Trump had threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade talks, prompting Canada to halt the tax, which was set to charge firms like Google and Meta 3% on Canadian revenues. Canadian officials framed the move as part of a broader negotiation, and trade talks between the two nations have since resumed. The tax was projected to generate C$5.9 billion over five years for Canada.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is grappling with a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to disability benefits, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces opposition from 40 to 50 of his own MPs who are concerned the reforms will harm vulnerable people. The government argues the changes are necessary for the long-term stability of the welfare state amid a spiraling benefits bill. The dispute is creating significant tension within the party, with a crucial vote looming in the House of Commons.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a marathon voting session on the "One Big Beautiful Bill," President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation. The bill, which passed narrowly in the House, includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" procedure to force votes on numerous amendments, putting Republicans on the record on controversial issues. GOP leaders are rushing to finalize and pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, navigating slim margins and opposition from a few of their own members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It does this by inhibiting a specific enzyme, effectively acting as a messenger that translates physical activity into physiological benefits. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of how exercise promotes longevity and could inform future anti-aging strategies.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical barriers, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK. Experts found that parents face difficulties booking appointments, getting time off work, and accessing clear information about their child's vaccination status. This decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. The report recommends improving booking systems via NHS apps, expanding vaccination services, and finalizing a "digital red book" for parents to track immunizations.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported that the company has not yet observed significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs on imported goods. In an interview, he attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making forward buys and deploying inventory in advance to avoid the duties. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, helps keep prices down as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides a buffer for customers against the immediate impact of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
