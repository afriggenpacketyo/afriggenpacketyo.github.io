          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the government of Qatar, prompting the Pentagon to assess its suitability for use as the new Air Force One. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the acceptance, stating that the Department of Defense will ensure the jet meets all necessary security measures and functional mission requirements. While President Trump is reportedly keen on using the jet, experts estimate that converting the 13-year-old aircraft into a secure Air Force One could cost over $1 billion and take several years. This move comes as Boeing faces delays in delivering the two 747s already being converted into the next Air Force Ones.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is set to acquire io, the AI device startup founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. Ive will assume significant creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io, with io merging into OpenAI while Ive's LoveFrom studio remains independent. This acquisition, OpenAI's largest to date, follows the company's recent purchase of AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion, marking a significant push into hardware to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. OpenAI is investing heavily in hardware to bring AI into the physical world, previously hiring Meta's AR glasses lead and investing in robotics startup Physical Intelligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bill that would provide a tax break on tip income, potentially benefiting a small subset of the U.S. workforce primarily in the restaurant, hotel, and courier service industries. Both President Trump and Vice President Harris supported the idea during campaign appearances in Nevada, and the bill allows workers to deduct 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028 if they are reported. However, experts raise concerns about fairness, potential income misclassification, and shifts in compensation structures, noting that lower-income tipped workers may not benefit significantly. The policy could also incentivize the introduction of tipping in new occupations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for potentially weaponizing the Justice Department by targeting political opponents and critics, even without sufficient evidence for prosecution. Ed Martin, leading the Justice Department's 'weaponization' group, plans to expose and discredit individuals he deems guilty, regardless of prosecutable crimes. This approach deviates from traditional prosecutorial norms, which emphasize impartiality and focusing on crimes rather than individuals. Critics argue that this tactic violates ethical and procedural rules, potentially infringing on the privacy and reputation of uncharged targets. The shift raises concerns about the erosion of justice impartiality and the potential for abuse of power.</p>

While some coaches and executives have expressed concerns about the play's safety and aesthetics, the NFL has maintained that no injuries have been directly linked to the 'tush push.'

          <p>California public school enrollment has experienced its seventh consecutive year of decline, coupled with an increase in students from low-income and homeless families. The most striking statistic is the significant difference between the number of 12th-grade students and 1st-grade students, indicating a shrinking school-age population. This demographic shift is attributed to lower birth rates and families migrating out of California due to high housing costs and remote work opportunities. Declining enrollment poses financial challenges for school districts, leading to job cuts and program reductions, although transitional kindergarten is seeing growth.</p>
