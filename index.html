          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" if deemed necessary, to address ongoing protests targeting immigration detention centers. This decision, announced via Truth Social, aims to protect ICE facilities from groups labeled as "domestic terrorists" like Antifa. However, the directive has faced strong opposition from Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, who assert that the city is safe and calm, with no national security threat warranting federal military intervention. The article highlights this as an expansion of Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and political dissent, raising concerns about potential constitutional challenges to the designation of groups as domestic terror organizations.</p>

This action follows a deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, described as a "targeted attack" by the FBI. Bondi vowed "ZERO TOLERANCE" for political violence, threatening federal charges for anyone threatening or assaulting federal officers and promising to dismantle groups funding extremists.

          <p>Former MP George Galloway and his wife were stopped by counter-terrorism police at Gatwick Airport following their return from Moscow via Abu Dhabi. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the pair, a man in his 70s and a woman in her 40s, were detained under Schedule 3 of the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, which permits questioning at ports to assess involvement in hostile activity. However, no arrests were made, and they were subsequently released. Galloway's Workers Party of Britain strongly criticized the detention, interpreting it as an attempt to intimidate political opponents advocating for improved international relations with nations like Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has launched a strong attack on Reform UK, labeling the party and its leader Nigel Farage as "toxic" and "unpatriotic" ahead of the Labour conference in Liverpool. Starmer accused Farage of spending more time making money in America and talking down the UK, rather than representing his constituents. The article highlights Labour's strategy to position itself as a patriotic alternative to Reform, especially concerning immigration policies like abolishing indefinite leave to remain, which polls show divides the public. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also commented on linking long-term settlement to broader community contributions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated public interest for decades. Trump noted Earhart's vanishing act nearly 90 years ago, which occurred during her attempt to circumnavigate the world. While the prevailing theory suggests she ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific, other unproven theories persist, including one that she was on a spy mission and captured by the Japanese. The article mentions a lawmaker's push for declassification and previous FBI and National Archives releases that debunked spy theories, with experts largely dismissing alternative explanations as "nonsense."</p>

This reported mass sacking is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader initiative to remove officials and policies deemed "woke" or left-leaning from federal agencies. While some right-wing commentators criticized the agents, others argued the act was a de-escalation tactic. The FBI Agents Association has condemned these dismissals, asserting that the agents' rights were violated and that such actions weaken the Bureau's capacity to recruit and retain skilled personnel, ultimately posing a risk to national security.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science has found that chimpanzees regularly consume substantial amounts of alcohol from naturally fermented fruit in their wild habitats, equivalent to approximately one small bottle of beer for humans each day. Researchers in Uganda's Kibale National Park and the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park observed these primates ingesting fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, accumulating to nearly 14 grams of alcohol daily. This groundbreaking discovery suggests that routine alcohol consumption may not be exclusively a human cultural trait but could possess deeper evolutionary origins within our closest primate relatives.

However, meteorologists are monitoring its potential interaction with another developing storm system in the western Atlantic, which could trigger the rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon involves two tropical storms merging or rotating around a shared center, an "intense dance" whose outcome depends on the storms' characteristics. While an interaction with Humberto is considered unlikely due to the other system's weaker state, the article notes it could still subtly alter their projected paths. South Carolina has proactively declared a state of emergency in anticipation of potential downstream impacts from these systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his participation in a New York protest where he urged American soldiers to disobey President Donald Trump's orders. Petro, who was in the U.S. for the annual U.N. General Assembly, publicly called on soldiers not to "point your rifles against humanity" and to "disobey the orders of Trump." Colombia's first leftist president, Petro, responded by citing international law granting him immunity and his European citizenship, indicating the revocation did not concern him. The article underscores growing diplomatic tensions between the two countries, previously strained by disagreements over drug trafficking and Petro's strong criticisms of Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have reportedly killed at least 57 people across Gaza, including nine from a single family in the Nuseirat refugee camp and five from a displaced persons' tent.

The article highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza City, where famine is reported and hospitals face collapse due to shortages and damage. US President Donald Trump, however, expressed optimism about a new peace plan, including a potential pathway to a Palestinian state, a concept Netanyahu has rejected.</p>

          <p>The Danish defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings at various defense facilities overnight, following a series of similar unexplained incidents earlier in the week that led to temporary airport shutdowns. Drones were specifically observed at Skrydstrup Air Base and the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, with local media also reporting activity near the major military Karup Air Base. These repeated, unidentified drone activities, which have also impacted neighboring Norway and Germany, have significantly heightened security concerns across northern Europe. In response, NATO has declared a significant upgrade to its Baltic Sea mission, incorporating enhanced intelligence and air-defense capabilities, and pledged a "resolute response" to such "reckless behavior" and Russian airspace violations, despite Moscow's denials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested that the Supreme Court uphold its executive order, enacted on President Trump's first day back in office, which seeks to deny birthright citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants or individuals holding temporary visas. This order has been consistently blocked by lower court judges who argue its unconstitutionality under the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The Justice Department contends that the "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" phrase excludes children of non-permanent or unlawful residents, asserting the policy is vital for national border security. The article highlights that this policy could lead to a substantial increase in the number of undocumented immigrants by 2050.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new 100% tariffs on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports, effective October 1, 2025, with an exemption for companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S. This move, communicated via social media, aims to incentivize domestic production but leaves many details unclear, particularly the distinction between branded and generic drugs. The article notes that major pharmaceutical companies have already pledged significant investments in U.S. production, potentially exempting them. Experts, however, predict these tariffs will increase costs for American patients and disrupt global supply chains, with countries like Ireland, Germany, and Switzerland being the top exporters to the US.
