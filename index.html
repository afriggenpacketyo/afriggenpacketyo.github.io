            <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump recently engaged in discussions regarding ongoing trade talks, addressing the situation in Ukraine, Iran, and Yemen. This call occurred after Trump imposed tariffs on UK goods, including a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from the UK and a higher 25% rate on imports of cars, steel, and aluminum. The leaders emphasized their commitment to free and open trade while protecting national interests, with Trump looking forward to a state visit with King Charles III later this year. The White House readout mentioned discussions on bilateral trade and efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Following the Canadian election debate featuring Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, NDP's Jagmeet Singh, and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, voters shared their impressions. Voters appreciated Carney's fresh perspective as a non-career politician, while others found Poilievre's message repetitive but effective. Concerns about the environment, cost of living, and Canada's sovereignty were common themes, with some expressing disappointment that climate action wasn't more concretely addressed. Overall, the debate was seen as civil and useful, reinforcing the feeling that Canada is in capable hands regardless of the election outcome.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred recently met at the White House to discuss baseball-related issues. The specifics of their conversation remain unclear, but one potential topic was Pete Rose's Hall of Fame candidacy, as Trump previously expressed support for Rose's posthumous pardon. The meeting occurred after a feature story about Jackie Robinson's military service was briefly removed from the Department of Defense's website before being restored. The meeting comes amid Trump's other activities such as spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

Eurostar apologized to affected passengers, initially citing a fire near the tracks as the cause of the disruption. All trains are now moving again after the issue was resolved.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to reclassify tens of thousands of career civil servants as "at-will" employees, making it easier to terminate their employment. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has proposed a rule that would reclassify these workers as "Schedule Policy/Career," removing civil service protections. The White House stated that this measure aims to address "unaccountable, policy-determining federal employees who put their own interests ahead of the American people's." OPM estimates that approximately 50,000 positions, or about 2% of federal workers, will be affected by the rule.</p>

Democrats are in a precarious position, defending due process for an individual with a concerning record, while public opinion on immigration shifts to the right.

            <p>The article explores the rise of dark humor as a coping mechanism in the face of political repression and chaos, drawing parallels to historical instances where humor served as a form of dissent. It references examples from Franco's Spain, Communist East Germany, and contemporary China, highlighting how authoritarian regimes often attempt to weaponize humor for their own purposes. The piece argues that black humor can be a form of self-defense and a way to express solidarity in the face of overwhelming malice, even if it acknowledges its own limitations. It also touches on the challenges of satire in an era where reality often surpasses hyperbole.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's response to the recent shooting at Florida State University, where two people were killed and six injured, has drawn criticism. Trump described the event as "a shame, horrible thing," and reiterated his support for the Second Amendment. Social media users have expressed outrage, with some noting the perceived lack of empathy in Trump's remarks.

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status amid an ongoing dispute over federal funding and allegations of insufficient protection for Jewish students. The threat comes after Harvard rejected demands from the administration to change its policies. Legal experts say that revoking Harvard's tax-exempt status would be a significant financial blow and could face legal challenges. The case of Bob Jones University, which lost its tax-exempt status due to racial discrimination, is being cited as a potential precedent.</p>

            <p>The White House has replaced government websites providing COVID-19 information with a new site dedicated to the lab leak theory. The new page, titled "Lab Leak. The True Origins of COVID-19," criticizes the Biden administration's response to the pandemic and promotes the theory that the virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. Scientists have expressed mixed reactions, with some criticizing the site as political propaganda. Federal agencies have issued conflicting reports about the origins of the pandemic.</p>

            <p>The Canadian party leaders' debate highlighted key issues such as trade relations with the U.S. and affordability. Liberal leader Mark Carney faced scrutiny over the legacy of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, while the leaders discussed strategies for negotiating with President Trump and responding to his tariffs. The debate also covered domestic policy issues, including housing, crime, and immigration. Smaller parties fought for air time as polls suggest a close race between the Conservatives and Liberals.</p>

            <p>A Texas school district, Lamar consolidated independent school district, has banned the Virginia state flag and seal from its online learning platform for younger students due to the depiction of a bare breast on the Roman goddess Virtus. The district cited its policy against "visual depictions or illustrations of frontal nudity" in elementary school library material. The decision has sparked controversy, with critics calling it a form of censorship. The Virginia flag has been subject to similar debates in the past.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is shifting its focus away from protecting marginalized groups to prioritizing Donald Trump's agenda, including investigating noncitizen voters and protecting white people from discrimination. New internal mission statements sent by Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally, emphasize voter fraud prevention and enforcement of Trump's executive orders. Critics argue this represents an abdication of the division's core responsibilities and a politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

            <h2>Trump Administration Aims to Reclassify Some Career Civil Servants for Easier Dismissal</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 16:03:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a new rule to classify some career civil servants as "at-will" federal employees, making it easier to fire underperforming or subversive employees. The rule, formerly referred to as "Schedule F," empowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles without lengthy procedural hurdles. The Office of Personnel Management estimates about 50,000 positions will ultimately be changed to the new status. Civil service employees currently have more protections than political appointees, under a rule intended to prevent turnover from administration to administration.</p>
