        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge comes as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate prices. JP Morgan Asset Management suggests that reducing rice prices could boost household spending if the reductions extend to processed foods and restaurant prices. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could also impact energy prices, further complicating the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing potential military action against Iran, including targeting its nuclear enrichment facility, while facing legal and political challenges at home. Lawmakers are debating the legality of military intervention without congressional approval, citing the War Powers Resolution. Critics fear escalation and retaliation from Iran, potentially endangering U.S. officials stationed overseas. The situation raises questions about potential violations of international law and the UN Charter, while supporters argue action is necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month in response to trade tensions with the United States. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Last month's cut was the first since October, and a number of commercial banks also reduced their deposit rates to protect their net interest margin. The loan prime rate influences corporate and household loans, while the five-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to allocate special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, earmarking 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the province's fiscal budget marks the first instance where these bonds, typically reserved for revenue-generating construction projects, will be used to cover government arrears. Proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. Experts suggest this move is a step in the right direction but may be insufficient given the scale of local government debt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The judge sided with 20 plaintiff states, issuing a preliminary injunction that barred the government from enforcing the new immigration rules. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. The administration's policy was deemed arbitrary and lacking specificity in how states should cooperate on immigration enforcement in exchange for transportation dollars.</p>

The exact nature of the site's protection is not fully known, and the weapon has never been used in combat. Even if damage is inflicted, Iran has the knowledge, experience, and resources to move forward with its nuclear program relatively easily. The expert suggests that military strikes are not a good option for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
