          <p>In Farmersville, Illinois, Chris Smith survived a gunshot to the head on Thanksgiving 2021, but his date, Leslie Reeves, was killed. Smith was found barely alive in his kitchen, with Reeves dead in the living room. Smith's dog, Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, kept him warm during the 12 hours before he was rescued, which EMTs believe helped him survive the cold temperatures in the house after the side door was broken during the incident. Robert Tarr, Reeves' ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder and attempted murder for the crime.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training vessel, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in two deaths and at least 22 injuries, according to Mayor Eric Adams. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before the crash, causing its masts to smash against the bridge's underside. The incident prompted a brief closure of the bridge and a large emergency response, as the vessel was supposed to head south to Iceland, but instead headed in the wrong direction. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the mechanical issues cited as the cause of the crash, as this is not the first time a tall ship has struck the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>China is shifting from direct government loans to Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models to finance infrastructure projects in Africa. This involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. The shift is evident in projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway, the stalled railway, and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. This approach allows Chinese contractors to recoup their investments through toll fees and operating rights over extended periods, addressing African governments' debt concerns.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election after the previous vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities. The initial election saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round. The annulment followed investigations into alleged electoral violations, including the use of fake social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages, which were deemed part of a Russian hybrid attack. Georgescu was subsequently banned from running in the May rerun.</p>

The proposal also includes charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. These measures aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall, attributed to factors such as tariffs and increased healthcare costs. While Newsom stated that no one would be removed from Medi-Cal, the changes are considered necessary to ensure the program's long-term financial stability.</p>

Despite India's economic growth and international standing, the ongoing tensions with Pakistan divert resources and attention. The risk of escalation, coupled with religious nationalism and superpower politics, complicates the situation. The conflict also undermines India's efforts to be seen as a major global player, as it remains entangled in regional disputes.</p>
