          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are deploying hundreds of their states' National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This move is in support of the Trump administration's initiative to address crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. The deployment has faced criticism from local officials, including D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who view it as an overreach of federal power and a challenge to the city's self-governance. The action follows President Trump's recent declaration of a public safety emergency in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin quickly escalated from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane due to a phenomenon known as rapid intensification. This process, where wind speeds increase dramatically in a short period, was fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Experts note that climate change is making such events more common, creating stronger storms that are harder to forecast and prepare for. While Erin is not expected to make landfall in the continental U.S., its strength highlights the growing risks of a busy hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Washington, D.C., to protest President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and his administration's efforts to exert federal control over the city's police force. Marching from DuPont Circle to the White House, protesters voiced their opposition to what they describe as a federal overreach and a politically motivated exaggeration of crime in the city. The demonstration followed a legal victory for D.C. officials, who successfully blocked the appointment of a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner." Organizers have indicated that more protests are planned for the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>After rapidly intensifying into a Category 5 storm, Hurricane Erin has slightly weakened to a Category 4 hurricane over the Atlantic. The storm's center is forecast to pass north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, remaining offshore and avoiding a direct impact on the islands. However, tropical storm watches are in effect for several areas, with officials warning of heavy rain, potential flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions. Current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward and staying well away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

Wheeler, a three-time All-Star and a leading contender for the Cy Young Award, currently leads the major leagues in strikeouts. No specific timetable has been provided for his return, marking a significant setback for the team as they lead the NL East division. The team is, however, anticipating the return of pitcher Aaron Nola, who has been sidelined for three months with his own injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly altered his approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, now advocating for a permanent peace agreement instead of a ceasefire. Following a summit with Vladimir Putin, reports indicate Trump is urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a deal that would require Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would reportedly freeze the current front lines in other occupied territories. This shift has caused concern among European allies and in Ukraine, with Zelenskyy scheduled to meet Trump in Washington to discuss the proposal.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., may be armed as part of their mission, a shift from previous guidance. While the troops are not authorized to make arrests, they will be equipped to protect federal property and support law enforcement. This development comes as part of President Trump's declared public safety emergency, which placed the city's police under federal control. The increased and potentially armed military presence in the nation's capital continues to draw criticism and protests from local residents and officials.</p>

After a challenging and costly restoration, the island now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million.

          <p>Despite ongoing hot weather, parts of the UK are showing signs of an early autumn, with trees shedding leaves and berries ripening ahead of schedule. Experts explain this is not a true seasonal shift but a stress response from nature due to a prolonged hot and dry summer, which is on track to be one of the warmest on record. This "false autumn" could have negative consequences for wildlife, as an early depletion of food sources like berries may leave birds and other animals struggling in the winter. The phenomenon is seen as another indicator of the chaotic impact of climate change on natural cycles.</p>

The dispute led to the exhumation of his body and a decade-long inquest that ultimately could not determine a cause of death.

          <p>Samsung has increased its share of the U.S. smartphone market, narrowing the gap with Apple, largely due to the growing momentum of its innovative foldable phones. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share rose to 31% while Apple's declined to 49%, signaling a renewed competition between the two tech giants. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget models to premium foldables like the Z Fold 7, is proving effective. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond by launching its own foldable iPhone to compete in this emerging category. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is more critical than ever and should be defended against political efforts to weaken it. While the law has successfully helped some species recover, many marine mammals like the North Atlantic right whale remain critically endangered. The author contends that new threats, including climate change, warming oceans, and pollution, are causing populations like West Coast gray whales to crash. Weakening these environmental laws, the article concludes, ignores the reality that the health of marine life is a key indicator of the planet's overall health.</p>
