          <p>A federal court hearing concluded without a ruling on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order against President Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook's lawsuit challenges the legality of her removal, arguing that the president lacks the required "cause" as stipulated by the Federal Reserve Act. Her legal team described the mortgage fraud allegations leveled by a Trump ally, which formed the basis for the dismissal, as a politically motivated smear campaign. The Justice Department countered that determining cause falls within the president's discretion, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector, who initially considered selling it but was persuaded by his wife to find its owner. Using the engravings on the ring, he connected with a classmate of the original owner via a university Facebook group. The owner, now 77, called the ring's return a miracle, highlighting a story of integrity and human connection across decades and distances.</p>

          <p>Ahead of its 51st season, 'Saturday Night Live' is facing a significant cast shake-up, with several performers announcing their exits. Long-serving cast member Heidi Gardner is departing after eight seasons, joined by Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim, who also confirmed they will not be returning. The departures follow the show's milestone 50th season, after which creator Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for a change to reinvent the program. These exits signal a period of transition for the iconic sketch comedy show as it prepares to introduce a new cast dynamic for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was a response to actions that undermine peace efforts, including seeking unilateral recognition of statehood and pursuing legal cases against Israel in international courts. This move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials attending UN headquarters. The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision as a violation of international law, while the UN expressed hope for a resolution.</p>

          <p>Shares for the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged by 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that significantly exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on $876 million in revenue, representing a 33% year-over-year increase and a shift to profitability from a loss in the previous year.

A source familiar with the matter stated that lawmakers learned of Mueller's health issues and intend to withdraw the subpoena that compelled his appearance. Mueller led the FBI from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Epstein was first investigated by federal authorities and received a controversial non-prosecution agreement. The committee's probe into Epstein's network and the handling of his case by federal agencies will continue with other high-profile witnesses.</p>

This unique and elaborate armor challenges previous theories that early ankylosaurs had simpler defenses that evolved over time.

Despite this, consumer spending increased by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend, though many are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases.

A Republican victory in the special election, scheduled for May 2026, would result in a tied 19-19 chamber.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a move to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress had previously allocated for the current fiscal year.

The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The action has drawn bipartisan criticism for circumventing Congress's constitutional power of the purse and is likely to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A father from Uganda shares his emotional experience of watching his son start kindergarten in a well-resourced public school in Maryland. He contrasts his son's bright, welcoming classroom with his own first school experience in a dirt-floored church building in rural Uganda, highlighting the vast difference in opportunity. The author reflects on his journey from Uganda to the U.S., made possible by an adoptive American family, and the profound gratitude he feels for being able to provide his child with an education he once only dreamed of. The moment represents the culmination of personal sacrifice and the hope for a better future.</p>

          <p>Amid a leadership crisis at the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn sharp criticism for making several questionable health claims. Following a school shooting in Minneapolis, he suggested a link between psychiatric drugs and gun violence, a remark that was condemned by lawmakers. He also claimed he could identify children with "mitochondrial challenges" simply by observing them in airports. This comes as former top CDC officials revealed that Kennedy has not been briefed by the agency's experts on key public health topics, raising further concerns about his leadership and the basis for his policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Canadian Colombian singer Tei Shi has released her fourth studio album, "Make believe I make believe," an intimate project she is self-releasing after departing her former record label. The album was born from a creative retreat in British Columbia, where she reconnected with her artistic vision free from outside pressures. The 10-track record explores a blend of genres, including what she calls "Canadianatón," which combines sounds from her Vancouver upbringing with Latin influences. The release marks a new era of creative control for the artist and will be supported by an upcoming North American headline tour.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates remaining elevated, seniors looking to tap into their home equity without refinancing have several viable options. One key method, available only to homeowners aged 62 and older, is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Other alternatives include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. These financial tools allow seniors to access their accumulated wealth while preserving their existing low-rate primary mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology dropped 15% after the company reported data center revenue that missed analyst expectations and provided a weaker-than-expected forecast for the current quarter. While overall second-quarter revenue met estimates and grew 58% year-over-year, driven by AI demand, sales in its key data center segment fell short. The company's guidance for third-quarter revenue was also slightly below consensus, with executives citing the non-linear growth patterns of its custom AI chip business. The results prompted a stock downgrade from Bank of America over concerns about the company's near-term AI growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed proposals for a buffer zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces as part of a potential peace agreement. He argued that such a concept is outdated and fails to account for the realities of modern drone warfare, which he said has already created a "dead zone" along the front lines. His comments followed reports that European officials were considering a 40-kilometer buffer as a component of a ceasefire. Zelensky reiterated that any deal requiring Ukraine to cede territory is unacceptable and stated that Russia could create distance by retreating from occupied Ukrainian lands.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., ostensibly to combat crime, has created a surreal and tense atmosphere in the city. While some residents express relief, many others, particularly in immigrant communities, feel a sense of fear and view the military presence as a step toward authoritarianism. The Guard's mission appears ambiguous, with troops observed performing tasks like landscaping and patrolling tourist areas, leading to confusion even among the soldiers themselves. The move is seen by critics as a potential test case for using the military as a domestic police force in other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Tesla is appealing a verdict that found the company partially liable for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system, resulting in a potential $242.5 million payout. The automaker has asked the court to either throw out the verdict or grant a new trial, arguing that the crash was caused entirely by driver recklessness, not a vehicle design defect. The lawsuit stemmed from an incident where a driver, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, failed to prevent his Model S from striking a parked car, killing one person and severely injuring another. Tesla's lawyers are also arguing for a steep reduction in damages.</p>

          <p>A growing number of historic, multigenerational ranches in the American West are being listed for sale as heirs find themselves in disagreement or have little interest in continuing the family legacy. Brokers report a significant increase in inventory of these trophy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. These sprawling properties, some on the market for the first time in over a century, represent a major transfer of generational wealth as families choose to cash out rather than manage the complex and capital-intensive operations of a modern ranch.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in its attempt to end the humanitarian program. The court noted that the TPS statute, as written by Congress, is designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides a significant, though potentially temporary, reprieve for Venezuelans who fled their country's political and economic crisis.</p>
