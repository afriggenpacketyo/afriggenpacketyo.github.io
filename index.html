          <p>Google has confirmed a data breach where the hacking group ShinyHunters stole customer data from an internal Salesforce database. The attackers used "vishing," or voice phishing, by impersonating company employees in phone calls to persuade IT support to reset login credentials. While Google stated the stolen data was primarily public business information, the incident highlights the vulnerability of even major tech companies to social engineering tactics. This article emphasizes that human error remains a critical weak point in corporate cybersecurity defenses.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware of what they need to furnish their new living spaces. The initiative, started after learning of a student who arrived with only a trash bag, aims to level the playing field and ensure these students feel prepared and equal to their peers. The program provides everything from bedding and towels to toolboxes and school supplies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of book removals is sweeping through Florida schools, driven by pressure from the state's board of education. Following a warning of legal action against one district for allegedly "pornographic" titles, numerous other districts have proactively pulled hundreds of books, including classics by Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut, to avoid similar conflict. Critics describe the actions as "state-driven censorship" aimed at erasing LGBTQ+ voices and discussions of race and gender. The bans are part of a broader national trend targeting diverse authors and topics.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations after more than 10,000 flight attendants went on strike, leaving thousands of travelers stranded during the peak summer season. The strike began after the airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees failed to reach a new contract agreement. Key points of contention include wages and compensation for unpaid work performed when aircraft are not in the air. The shutdown is expected to impact approximately 130,000 passengers daily, with significant disruptions to both domestic and international travel.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the Atlantic season's first hurricane, now a Category 4 storm with winds up to 130 mph. While the storm is forecast to pass north of the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico, it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast next week. Although the majority of meteorological models predict Erin will remain hundreds of miles offshore, coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, could face significant beach erosion. A cold front is expected to help keep the hurricane out at sea.</p>

          <h2>Fewer Young Adults Achieving Traditional Milestones of Adulthood, Census Bureau Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals that fewer young adults aged 25 to 34 are reaching key life milestones traditionally associated with adulthood, such as moving out, getting a job, marrying, and having children. Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had achieved all four, less than a quarter have done so today. The report attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over marriage and parenthood.</p>

While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new form factors are attracting consumers.

Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, have caused U.S. grain exports to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing prices.

          <h2>Ukrainian Firm Develops Unjammable Fiber-Optic Drone with 100km Range</h2>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons company is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by a fiber-optic cable, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The new design aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind the front lines. This innovation reflects the changing nature of the battlefield, where long-range precision strikes are becoming crucial. While longer cables present technical challenges, the immunity to jamming offers a major tactical advantage.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its influence in Africa's Sahel region by providing significant military equipment to Burkina Faso. This move comes as the nation's junta-led government turns away from traditional Western security partners like the United States and France. The arms deliveries, which include fire support vehicles and rocket launch systems from Chinese state-owned contractor Norinco, are part of Burkina Faso's military modernization plan to combat jihadist insurgencies. The growing military cooperation signals a strategic shift, with China filling the security vacuum left by Western powers.</p>

          <h2>Baltimore's Violent Crime Rate Reaches 50-Year Low Through Targeted Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 07:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its homicide rate falling to the lowest level in five decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence. The city's approach combines offers of social support, such as housing and job training, with the threat of focused law enforcement for those who refuse help. This multi-agency effort, which includes social workers, police, and community groups, represents a significant shift from previous policing tactics.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people are expected to participate in "Fight the Trump Takeover" protests across 34 states to oppose Republican plans for mid-decade redistricting. The demonstrations are a response to efforts in states like Texas and Florida to redraw congressional maps in a way that would heavily favor Republican candidates in future elections. The protests are being organized by a coalition of left-leaning groups and the Democratic National Committee. This follows a move by California's governor to counter-gerrymander if red states proceed with their plans.</p>

          <p>Hundreds gathered for a vigil in Monrovia, California, to honor Carlos Roberto Montoya, a Guatemalan day laborer who was struck and killed by a vehicle while fleeing an immigration raid. Montoya ran onto a freeway after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared at a local Home Depot. Community organizers and politicians at the vigil blamed the Trump administration's immigration policies for creating a climate of fear that leads to such tragic outcomes. The Department of Homeland Security stated that its agents were not actively pursuing Montoya at the time of his death.</p>

          <p>An LGBTQ youth center in Bell, California, has been repeatedly targeted by vandals who have been throwing bags of dog feces at the building's entrance. The Mi SELA youth center, a partnership between the Los Angeles LGBT Center and the Latino Equity Alliance, provides vital resources to the local community. Organizers have denounced the incidents as "abhorrent" and "targeted hate," and a local county supervisor has pledged funds for security cameras. Staff at the center say they will not be deterred from their mission to support LGBTQ youth.</p>

          <p>A great horned owl was rescued in Orange County after becoming entangled in a glue trap, a device intended for rodents. A well-meaning individual cut the bird's wings to free it, inadvertently causing severe damage that will require the owl to undergo a complete molt before it can fly again. Wildlife experts warn that this recovery could take more than a year and are using the incident to highlight the indiscriminate and cruel nature of glue traps, which often harm unintended wildlife. They advise the public to bring trapped animals to rescue centers without attempting to free them.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing crisis of homelessness among older Americans, health care organizations are increasingly venturing into providing housing solutions. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally aim to keep frail seniors in their homes but now find they must first secure housing for their clients. Rising housing costs and economic precarity are pushing more people over 55 into homelessness for the first time. This has prompted PACE and even some hospitals to partner with housing providers or build their own facilities to ensure patients' basic needs are met.</p>
