          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she described as "disgusting" and "humiliating." She recounted being directed by Combs in these encounters, specifying the color of her nails and the sex acts she performed, stating she felt as though her career was performing for Combs' sexual satisfaction. Ventura's testimony included graphic descriptions of acts she said she did not consent to, further explaining that she stayed with Combs due to love and fear of disappointing him, also fearing his power over her career and potential blackmail. The judge denied a request to downplay Ms. Venturaâ€™s visible pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend some reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. reduced tariffs imposed on China to 30% from 145%, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain a portion of the tariffs for negotiation, and China agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals. The two nations will establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns, aiming to iron out details for their future trade relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants to treat injuries, showcasing a form of 'forest first aid.' Researchers observed chimpanzees applying plants to their own wounds and, in some instances, tending to the wounds of other chimps, even those unrelated. This behavior includes dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the chewed material to open injuries. The study, published in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, suggests that chimpanzees possess a capacity for empathy and builds on previous findings that they consume specific plants for self-medication, with many of these plants exhibiting antibacterial properties.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which provide personalized wealth management services to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth, but struggle to find qualified money managers. The demand for talent is outpacing the supply, as family offices face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds. While trust is a key criterion for hiring, family offices also seek professionals who can combine multiple roles, such as chief investment officer and CFO, which is a difficult combination to find. European family offices are increasing compensation packages to attract and retain talent, including bonuses, co-investment opportunities, and profit sharing.</p>

          <p>Families of the victims of a Jeju Air plane crash in South Korea have filed a criminal complaint against 15 individuals, including the transport minister and the airline's CEO, citing professional negligence. The crash, which occurred at Muan International Airport, resulted in 179 fatalities out of 181 passengers, prompting calls for a thorough investigation into potential mismanagement and preventable risks. The complaint raises questions about air traffic control's response and regulatory compliance concerning runway construction and bird control measures. The investigation continues to determine the precise causes of the crash, with earlier findings indicating bird feathers in the jet's engines.</p>

In response, Carney has invited King Charles to open the Canadian parliament as a symbol of sovereignty.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will lift sanctions on Syria and plans to meet with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia. The decision to lift sanctions was met with celebration in Damascus, as the previous sanctions had blocked foreign financing, including aid. Trump stated that this policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness." However, concerns remain regarding the protection of ethnic minorities, particularly after mass killings of civilians from the Alawite sect during clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists, as well as clashes between Islamist factions and the Druze religious minority.</p>

This move comes despite recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries following a deadly military clash in the Galwan Valley in 2020.

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan aims to be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

Despite this, he defended Biden's cognitive abilities during his term, emphasizing that Biden was effective and engaged, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse. Buttigieg's visit to Iowa has sparked speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run, although he remains coy about his future plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated descriptions of U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have caused friction in Indian politics, particularly regarding claims about trade incentives and warnings. India has directly contradicted Trump's assertions, stating that trade was never discussed during negotiations. The Indian government is concerned about appearing to have halted military actions under external pressure, especially in a conflict with Pakistan. Trump's approach, which treats India and Pakistan as equals and offers to mediate bilateral issues, has left Indian political leaders vulnerable to criticism.</p>

This increase comes after a previous 20% rate hike last year, drawing criticism from consumer groups and homeowners who have struggled to receive fair compensation after their homes were destroyed. State Farm requested the emergency rate increase citing a "dire situation," but Consumer Watchdog argues that the insurer has exaggerated its financial strain.
