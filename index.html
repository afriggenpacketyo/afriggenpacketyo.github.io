          <p>Eleven high school lacrosse players in upstate New York are facing charges of unlawful imprisonment after allegedly kidnapping a younger player at gunpoint. The incident involved the victim being taken to a remote area, where individuals dressed in black, armed with a handgun and a knife, placed a pillowcase over his head, tied him up, and put him in the trunk of a car. The district attorney issued a 48-hour ultimatum for the perpetrators to turn themselves in to avoid facing felony kidnapping charges. The school district is cooperating with the investigation and remains committed to student safety and accountability.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that semaglutide, the compound in Wegovy, could be effective in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a common liver disease. A study involving 800 adults with MASH showed that semaglutide reduced liver inflammation and scarring. The drug may be approved as a treatment for MASH, and longer-term data will assess its ability to prevent liver transplants or death from liver disease. Patients in the trial received nutrition and exercise counseling, contributing to improved liver health.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Oklahoma's use of government funds for the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The justices appeared divided on whether excluding the school would constitute religious discrimination. The case raises questions about the First Amendment and the separation of church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could impact laws in other states and affect the balance between government funding for private and religious schools.</p>

The U.S. government used the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center. The arrangement with El Salvador involved sending MS-13 leaders back to the country in exchange. The process has faced legal challenges and scrutiny regarding the assessment of who was deported.</p>
