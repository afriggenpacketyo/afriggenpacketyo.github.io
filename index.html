            <p>Kerri Pegg, a 42-year-old prison governor, has been found guilty of two counts of misconduct in a public office after beginning a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang boss incarcerated in her prison.

Many Chinese manufacturers had relocated to Vietnam to avoid previous U.S. tariffs, but the new levies could undermine this strategy.

            <p>According to analyst Francisco Pinto, the Lakers have undergone a profound transformation with the addition of Luka Doncic, altering their playing style and overall identity. While the team already had Anthony Davis as a central figure, Doncic's arrival has raised the team's ceiling. LeBron James has adapted by assuming a secondary role in ball-handling, allowing Doncic to become the primary playmaker. Pinto believes that if the Lakers remain healthy and develop strong chemistry, they could be a formidable contender in the Western Conference playoffs.</p>
