          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, following the administration's moves to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. The address comes after West Point disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers, following the administration's guidance. Critics, including former West Point teachers, have argued that these programs did not hinder the values of the academies, while Trump's supporters claim that such programs were infiltrated by 'Woke Leftist Ideologues.'
