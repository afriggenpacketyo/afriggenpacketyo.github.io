            <p>Former President Donald Trump voiced his hope that Russia and Ukraine will reach an agreement following the recent Easter ceasefire, suggesting it could lead to lucrative business opportunities for the United States. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of violating the ceasefire numerous times, casting doubt on Russia's intentions. Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick echoed Zelenskyy's skepticism, emphasizing Vladimir Putin's history of not keeping his word. The temporary ceasefire followed Trump's announcement of a minerals deal with Ukraine, with details remaining relatively unknown. Optimism for a deal is tempered by mistrust and ongoing conflict. </p>

Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee reportedly stemmed from NIL-related issues. The quarterback will have three seasons of eligibility remaining at UCLA and is expected to compete for the starting role. The addition of Iamaleava raises questions about the future of current UCLA quarterback Joey Aguilar.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claimed its troops opened fire believing they faced a threat, and that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. The inquiry resulted in the dismissal of a deputy commander and reprimand for another officer. The incident occurred in what the IDF called a "hostile and dangerous combat zone."</p>
