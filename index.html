China's commerce department spokesperson stated these steps undermine the Geneva deal, vowing to protect China's interests. China has maintained control over rare earth exports, contrary to U.S. expectations, signaling a firm stance in negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda.

The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity with the Sounders, demanding a fair share of the FIFA Club World Cup prize money. Despite FIFA paying MLS teams large amounts to participate, the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of those funds to the players, leading to a dispute over bonus distribution.</p>

However, residents are subject to an officer's discretion upon entering the country. If a resident stays outside the US for more than six months, immigration considers that they have abandoned their residency, so it is better to apply for a permit.</p>
