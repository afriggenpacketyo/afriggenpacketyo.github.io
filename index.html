          <p>A 36-year-old Nevada man, Jesse James Dallmann, has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman's body was discovered at a remote, undeveloped campsite in Sierra County, California. Deputies found the woman deceased and Dallmann in an "incoherent" state at the scene early Friday morning. The Sierra County Sheriff’s Office is leading a homicide investigation, stating they believe it was an isolated incident with no further threat to the community. The victim's identity has not yet been released, and Dallmann also faces a charge of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.</p>

          <p>Hundreds marched in London demanding Hamas release all Israeli hostages, while also protesting the UK government's plan to potentially recognize a Palestinian state. The demonstration, which included relatives of hostages, ended near the Prime Minister's office, with organizers arguing that freeing the captives should be the top priority. The event followed a separate protest where over 500 supporters of the recently banned pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action were arrested for intentionally violating anti-terror laws. These back-to-back demonstrations highlight the intense and conflicting public reactions in Britain to the ongoing Israel-Gaza war.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey's western Balikesir province, resulting in the death of an 81-year-old individual and injuring at least 29 others. The tremor, centered in the town of Sindirgi, caused the collapse of 16 buildings and was felt as far as Istanbul, approximately 200 kilometers away. According to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, search and rescue operations have concluded without finding more casualties. Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in Turkey, which is situated on major fault lines, and this event recalls the devastating 7.8 magnitude quake in 2023.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have reportedly agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from certain advanced chips sold to China. This deal would grant them the necessary export licenses to sell specifically designed chips, like Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308, in the Chinese market. The agreement highlights the White House's strategy of using tariff policies and exceptions as negotiation tools in its ongoing economic competition with China. Nvidia confirmed it adheres to U.S. government rules for global market participation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fierce political battle has erupted over a Republican-led effort to redraw Texas's congressional maps, a move Democrats are calling "cheating" to secure an unfair advantage in upcoming elections. To prevent the Republican-controlled state House from reaching a quorum to pass the new maps, a group of Democratic lawmakers has fled Texas. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the lawmakers arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special legislative sessions. Prominent Democrats, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Bernie Sanders, have defended the maneuver as a necessary fight against an undemocratic power grab.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a planned military takeover of Gaza City, asserting it is the only way to "complete the defeat of Hamas" and free the remaining hostages. Speaking to foreign media, he stated the goal is not to occupy Gaza but to demilitarize it and install a non-Israeli civilian administration, operating on a "fairly short timetable." The plan has drawn widespread international condemnation and sparked fears for the safety of civilians and hostages, with the UN Security Council holding an emergency meeting to address the potential humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire has been burning on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, prompting authorities to close all hiking routes in the popular national park to tourists. Firefighting efforts involve numerous ground teams, six Canadair planes, and the army, which has created a fire break to contain the blaze. The fire is concentrated on the densely vegetated Mount Somma side and has affected over 1,200 acres, with smoke visible from the nearby Pompeii archaeological site. The incident is part of a broader trend of severe wildfires across Europe, fueled by intensifying summer heatwaves linked to climate change.</p>

Vance confirmed that President Trump is "thinking about it" but has not yet made a final decision, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship. This potential action is part of the administration's broader strategy to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The move would utilize broad executive authority to penalize any country found to be importing Russian oil, signaling a potential escalation in trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The article profiles settler leaders who openly state their goal is to ensure Palestinians have no future in the land, while UN data shows a sharp rise in daily settler attacks. The report argues that this activity, supported by far-right ministers in the Israeli government, is part of a broader agenda to expand settlements and extinguish hopes for a Palestinian state.

He highlights that the war destroyed much of the infrastructure and communications built in the preceding decades. This widespread destruction effectively forced China to "start again" in the post-war era, profoundly influencing its subsequent political and social development.</p>

          <p>Bobby Whitlock, the soulful keyboardist, singer, and songwriter who co-founded the influential blues-rock band Derek and the Dominos with Eric Clapton, has died at 77. Whitlock was a crucial contributor to the band's legendary 1970 album "Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs," co-writing half its tracks, including "Bell Bottom Blues." He began his career at Stax Records before joining Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, where he connected with Clapton and George Harrison, playing on the latter's "All Things Must Pass." His wife and musical partner, CoCo Carmel, remembered him as a man who saw life as an adventure.</p>

          <p>Key European leaders are stressing that Ukraine must be a participant in any peace negotiations between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who are scheduled to meet in Alaska. In a joint statement, leaders from France, Germany, Poland, the U.K., and the EU welcomed efforts to end the war but firmly stated that a path to peace "cannot be decided without Ukraine." The statement follows a meeting between Vice President JD Vance and European officials, where Vance described the upcoming summit as a "major breakthrough" aimed at finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict.</p>

          <p>The man who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer before dying himself, has been identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. According to a law enforcement official, White had become fixated on his distrust of the COVID-19 vaccine, which he blamed for making him depressed and suicidal. He was armed with five guns and had attempted to enter the CDC building before being stopped by guards, after which he began shooting from across the street. The incident has prompted a union representing CDC workers to demand that federal officials condemn vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a nightclub in Santa Lucía, Ecuador, has left eight people dead and three others injured, marking the latest deadly incident in the nation's struggle against surging crime. Authorities reported that heavily armed suspects arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire on the patrons. The shooting occurred in the coastal province of Guayas, one of the country's most dangerous regions, which remains under a state of emergency. Officials attribute the escalating violence to turf wars between organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels, with thousands of homicides recorded this year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer from preventable heat-related illnesses and deaths. Advocates and some lawmakers argue that an ineffective enforcement system by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA, is largely to blame for the ongoing danger. A recent state audit criticized the agency for insufficient staffing and failure to take proper action when workers fall ill. The risks are compounded by the fact that many farmworkers are undocumented and fear retaliation if they complain about unsafe conditions, a situation worsened by intensifying heatwaves.</p>

          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has revealed that his only early symptom was a change in bowel movements, which he dismissed at the time. The 48-year-old "Dawson’s Creek" star said he was otherwise healthy and had no glaring red flags before his diagnosis, highlighting how silently the disease can develop. Medical experts confirm that changes in bowel habits are a key sign, along with fatigue, blood in stool, and abdominal discomfort. Van der Beek's experience underscores the importance of the updated screening recommendation for adults to begin at age 45.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, the union representing its employees has demanded that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation, which they say created a climate of hostility. The gunman, who killed a police officer, was reportedly motivated by a deep distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. The union stated the attack "compounds months of mistreatment, neglect, and vilification that CDC staff have endured," and called on HHS leadership to take a clear stance against disinformation to protect scientists. The union is also demanding enhanced security for its members.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had any "bad intention" when a minute's silence for former player Diogo Jota and his brother was disrupted at the Community Shield match. The referee cut the remembrance short after shouting was heard from the Palace supporters' end of Wembley stadium. Slot suggested an unaware fan may have started cheering, leading other Palace fans to try and quiet them, which inadvertently created more noise. Jota, 28, and his brother Andre Silva, 25, died in a car crash last month.</p>

          <p>The German government has ordered a partial halt to arms exports to Israel, specifically suspending weapons that could be used in a potential offensive in Gaza City. Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended the decision, stating that while Germany's solidarity with Israel is unchanged, it cannot supply weapons for a conflict where thousands of civilians could be killed. The move represents a significant policy shift for Germany, one of Israel's staunchest allies, and comes as Israel faces growing international condemnation for its war plans. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said he hopes Merz will reverse the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing significant turmoil, exemplified by its handling of a gene therapy from Sarepta Therapeutics for a rare muscular dystrophy. The agency granted the costly $3.2 million treatment an accelerated approval despite weak clinical data, a decision praised by some for its flexibility but later complicated when three patients died, forcing a suspension. This case highlights the immense pressure the FDA is under to balance the urgent needs of patients with rare diseases against the rigorous, data-driven standards for drug safety and efficacy. The incident underscores the difficult dilemmas plaguing the critical regulatory agency. (not investment advice)</p>
