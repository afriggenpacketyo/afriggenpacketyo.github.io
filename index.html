          <p>A cat owner in the UK is sharing his story after his pet nearly died from a toxic reaction to counterfeit flea treatment purchased from a major online retailer. The incident prompted an urgent warning from the UK government about the dangers of fake veterinary products, as more pet owners turn to online sellers to cope with rising vet bills. The counterfeit product, which looked nearly identical to the genuine brand, was found to contain a chemical highly toxic to cats. Officials are urging owners to buy medications only from vets or registered online retailers and to be vigilant for signs of fake products.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, four individuals were arrested for projecting unauthorized images onto the walls of Windsor Castle. The projections reportedly included a photo of Trump with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as Trump's mugshot from his indictment in Georgia. Thames Valley Police responded swiftly to the incident, arresting the four adults on suspicion of malicious communications. The stunt occurred as the president began his official visit, which includes a ceremonial welcome and state banquet at the royal residence.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded lower, following losses on Wall Street, as investors cautiously awaited the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 both saw declines, while South Korea's Kospi experienced a more significant drop. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut, but uncertainty remains about the size of the cut and the central bank's future guidance. The cautious trading reflects global investor sentiment ahead of the key economic decision from the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old Honduran man, identified by ICE as an illegal immigrant who had been previously deported, has been charged with murder in Queens, New York. The suspect, Edwin Cruz Gomez, allegedly ran down a 16-year-old girl and her mother with his vehicle after they rejected his sexual advances. The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene, while her mother is in stable condition. According to an ICE source, Gomez has a history of prior DUI arrests and was released under the Alternatives to Detention program in 2013, after which he disappeared from monitoring.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, placing the company's valuation at $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of the previously expected range and marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to go public, which had been delayed twice. Co-founder Eric Baker, who reacquired the company in 2020, is bringing it to the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB."

          <p>A new study from Yale University researchers reports that thousands of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are being subjected to "forced militarization" and "reeducation" at a minimum of 210 facilities. The report details how children are indoctrinated with pro-Russian narratives and, in some cases, engaged in combat training and the production of military equipment. This research adds to the evidence behind the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for the war crime of unlawful deportation of children. Ukraine's government estimates over 19,500 children have been abducted since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the two state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The judge ruled that the charges were "legally insufficient," stating there was no evidence of a desire to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and multiple weapons offenses, in addition to separate federal charges that carry a possible death penalty. His lawyers had also argued for the entire state case to be thrown out on double jeopardy grounds, but that request was denied.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its decision on interest rates, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The central bank faces a complex economic landscape, balancing a slowing labor market against inflation that has been creeping higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs. While President Trump has publicly pressured the Fed for a rate cut to stimulate the economy, officials maintain their decisions are data-driven. The announcement is highly anticipated, as it could signal a broader policy pivot and set the tone for borrowing costs for the remainder of the year.</p>

The lawsuit follows a $1.2 billion fine and a research funding freeze imposed on UCLA over accusations of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. The plaintiffs claim the administration's demands, which include government access to university data and a ban on diversity scholarships, represent a grave threat to the university's independence.

As part of the visit, a major technology deal was announced, with US firms pledging £31 billion for UK-based AI and nuclear power initiatives. Despite the diplomatic focus, the trip has also drawn protests, including images of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein being projected onto Windsor Castle.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Examines the Contradiction of Using Charlie Kirk's Murder to Suppress Dissent</h2>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic explores the irony of Charlie Kirk's allies calling for crackdowns on "hate speech" following his murder, given Kirk built his career on provocative, free-speech advocacy. It notes that while Kirk championed debate as a tool to spread his often-controversial views, some supporters are now using his death to justify censorship and legal action against political opponents. The piece highlights a tension within the MAGA movement, which is simultaneously lionizing Kirk as a free-speech martyr while its leaders threaten to punish dissenting voices and suppress ideas they dislike.</p>

          <p>Two Labour Members of Parliament, Simon Opher and Peter Prinsley, were denied entry into Israel while on a parliamentary delegation to the occupied West Bank. The MPs, who are both doctors, intended to observe medical and humanitarian work being done by aid organizations in the region. They were stopped while crossing from Jordan and told they were not being admitted on "public order" grounds before being sent back. The UK Foreign Office condemned the decision as "totally unacceptable," marking the second time this year that British MPs have been barred from entering the Palestinian territories by Israeli authorities.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, in the US temporarily to help build an electric car battery plant, were detained in a large-scale immigration raid in Georgia. Several engineers told the BBC they were treated like criminals, handcuffed and shackled with chains by armed agents, despite believing they were in the country legally on short-term visas or waivers. The workers described freezing conditions and unsanitary water at the detention center. The incident has shaken relations between the two allied nations, and South Korean officials are investigating potential human rights violations by US authorities.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old wild burro is recovering after being shot with an arrow in Moreno Valley, California, the latest in a series of at least six such attacks since June. The arrow punctured the burro's lung, requiring emergency surgery to remove the arrowhead. The animal, nicknamed Cupid, is now stable at a sanctuary run by the non-profit DonkeyLand, which is offering a $24,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Wild burros are a protected and iconic species in the region, and the repeated, deliberate attacks have sparked outrage and an ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray detailed the case against Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Gray revealed text messages where Robinson allegedly confessed to his roommate, stating he acted because Kirk "spreads too much hate" and that "some hate can't be negotiated out." The prosecutor announced he would seek the death penalty, citing aggravated murder charges based on evidence that Robinson planned the attack and targeted Kirk for his political expression.

A new agreement with the IOC provides the league with better promotional rights and improved conditions for players.

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that more major sports conglomerates will go public. Speaking at a conference, Harris explained that sports assets have historically been valued more highly in private markets, and publicly traded teams often trade below their intrinsic value. He argued that private ownership allows for a long-term perspective focused on winning, which can involve significant spending that public markets might not embrace. Instead, leagues like the NFL are turning to approved private equity firms for minority investments, which provide capital while allowing owners to maintain long-term control.</p>

Lilly recently paused plans for a biotech incubator in the UK, joining other firms concerned about policies like the government's rebate system for branded medicines. Ricks warned that capital flows to where it is welcomed, suggesting the US should take note of the UK's struggles as it considers its own drug pricing reforms.</p>
