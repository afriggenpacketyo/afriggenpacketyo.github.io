          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to refine his pitching approach after recent struggles, including a blown save against the Mets. Despite having good "stuff," Scott has been leaving too many pitches in the middle of the strike zone, leading to hits. Pitching coach Mark Prior suggests Scott needs to focus on getting more chase out of the zone, even if it means walking a few more batters. With several other high-leverage relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the Dodgers' bullpen stability. (not investment advice)</p>
