        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu, an assortment of common respiratory viruses, widely affects new university students due to close living conditions, late-night socializing, and shared facilities. Immunologists explain that students' immune systems are often compromised by stress, poor diet, and insufficient sleep during this transitional period, making them highly susceptible. While typically not serious, the illness can spread easily, with individuals transmitting viruses even before symptoms appear. The article highlights how social pressures often lead students to prioritize activities over necessary rest, exacerbating the spread and severity, and advises seeking medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, to ensure proper recovery and rule out more serious conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Deborah Boardman, appointed by President Biden, has sparked conservative outrage for imposing an eight-year prison sentence on Nicholas Roske, who attempted to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The Department of Justice had sought a 30-year term, but the judge cited Roske's confession and cooperation as mitigating factors. Conservative figures, including Mike Davis and Attorney General Pam Bondi, condemned the sentence as "lenient" and an "affront to the judicial system," with some critics also questioning the consideration of Roske's transgender identity during sentencing. The DOJ has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deploying 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, a move opposed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who views it as a "manufactured performance" by the Trump administration rather than a genuine public safety effort. This deployment follows an incident where federal agents shot an armed individual after allegedly being rammed and surrounded by vehicles near an ICE facility. Local leaders have criticized DHS for what they perceive as escalating aggression against Illinois citizens, pointing to a separate event where border patrol agents reportedly used chemical agents during an immigration enforcement action, fueling federal-state tensions.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback and Fox Sports commentator Mark Sanchez was arrested on misdemeanor charges, including battery with injury and public intoxication, after being hospitalized for a stabbing in downtown Indianapolis. Police responded to a disturbance where Sanchez and another individual sustained injuries, with Sanchez initially in critical but stable condition. The specific details of the altercation remain unclear, though a suspect has been detained. The Marion County Prosecutor’s Office will determine the final charges, as Sanchez was in the city to broadcast an NFL game. This incident casts a shadow over the former player's public profile.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, clashed with anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace, deploying water cannons and pepper spray. The unrest is rooted in last year's disputed parliamentary election, which the pro-European Union opposition alleges was rigged, and the government's subsequent suspension of EU membership talks. Demonstrators, waving national and EU flags, demanded the release of political prisoners and new parliamentary elections, accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party of aligning with Russian interests. This confrontation on local election day underscores the country's profound political polarization and persistent civil unrest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration initiative that sought to transfer immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18, reinforcing an earlier court order. Judge Rudolph Contreras's ruling mandates that these individuals be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless deemed a danger or flight risk. This legal intervention occurs amid criticisms that the administration is reviving family separation practices and offering financial incentives for children to self-deport. Advocates argue these policies coerce vulnerable minors into abandoning legal claims and returning to perilous conditions, highlighting ongoing contentious immigration issues.</p>

Despite her traditional views on social issues, she has recently proposed policies supporting women's health and childcare, drawing from personal caregiving experiences. Her election marks a significant moment for Japan's political landscape, though she faces challenges in regaining voter trust and addressing a rising far-right.</p>

This situation hinders a comprehensive federal investigation into the fire's root causes.

          <p>The protracted federal government shutdown has significantly impacted U.S. National Parks, leading to widespread closures, reduced staffing, and a reliance on state and third-party donations for basic operations.

Significant concerns have been raised about potential vandalism, sanitation problems, and ecological harm, echoing issues from previous shutdowns where parks like Joshua Tree experienced severe damage.

The plan also involves transforming the immigration enforcement unit into a "Removals Force" with significantly increased funding and powers, taking inspiration from US policies.

          <p>Jack Daniel’s, owned by Brown-Forman, has terminated its 45-year program of providing free spent grain to local Tennessee farmers, a decision feared to severely impact the regional agricultural economy. Farmers, many with deep ties to the distillery, express feelings of betrayal by a company that has long leveraged its small-town roots in its branding. Jack Daniel’s asserts the change, communicated in 2022, is vital for meeting global environmental goals and maintaining international sales, as a new facility will convert waste into renewable energy. The article underscores the growing conflict between corporate sustainability initiatives and the preservation of long-standing local community relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 13:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is considering minting a commemorative $1 coin featuring President Donald Trump, with the phrase "Fight, Fight, Fight," to mark the nation's 250th anniversary. The proposed design includes Trump's profile and a depiction of him raising his fist after a 2024 assassination attempt. This initiative stems from bipartisan legislation signed by Trump in 2020, authorizing special $1 coins for the semiquincentennial. However, legal provisions generally prohibit depicting living persons on U.S. currency, posing a potential hurdle. The article also notes Trump's declining approval ratings and the perceived negative economic impacts of his administration's policies.</p>
