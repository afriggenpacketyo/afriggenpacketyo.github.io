The company also reported $144 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. According to Suresh Singh, Thirty Ink's secretary-chairman, all businesses within the portfolio are profitable, which is a key differentiator from other athlete-driven ventures that don't always prioritize profit and mission.</p>

          <p>Former Congolese President Joseph Kabila's recent visit to Goma, a city controlled by M23 rebels, has ignited controversy, with the government accusing him of supporting the rebels and potentially facing treason charges. Kabila claims his visit aimed to promote peace in the embattled region, meeting with religious and community leaders. However, the government views his presence as legitimizing M23 and its political umbrella organization, AFC, alleging Kabila's involvement. The political situation remains tense as the humanitarian crisis worsens, with human rights organizations condemning M23 for mass murders of Congolese civilians.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a £15 billion investment in transport infrastructure across England, focusing on tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. Greater Manchester will receive £2.5 billion to extend its tram network, while the West Midlands will get £2.4 billion for service extensions, and £2.1 billion will be allocated to start building the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. The investment marks a move away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east, and aims to address regional inequalities. The funding is part of a five-year allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32, doubling the current spending allocation by 2029-30.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, is on trial for allegedly murdering her estranged husband's relatives by serving them poisonous mushrooms at a lunch in July 2023; Patterson claims she unknowingly used death cap mushrooms, believing they were dried fungi from an Asian supermarket. Prosecutors argue that she lured her guests with a false story about having cancer before deliberately serving them the toxic meal. Patterson testified that she was trying to improve the flavor of the dish, and that she herself was spared the worst effects because she self-induced vomiting after the meal. The trial continues with Patterson's cross-examination, where she faces potential life imprisonment if convicted.</p>

This marks a shift from the previous year's report, which cited high inflation as a barrier to entry. While there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding Eurozone membership, the country's Prime Minister supports the move, which is expected to bring more investment, trade, stability, and prosperity to the Bulgarian people.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced changes to the winter fuel payment in the UK, widening eligibility for more people to receive the allowance this year. The payment, worth up to £300 to help cover energy costs, was previously limited to those on pension credit, a policy that drew criticism. The means test will be increased to allow more pensioners to qualify, though details on the specific changes remain unclear. The government insists the partial reversal is possible due to improvements in the economic picture, following the initial decision to means-test the payment to stabilize public finances.</p>

The missile, which entered service in 1981, is accurate to within 500 meters, a critical factor for modern military doctrines.

In response, China lodged a solemn protest, accusing the U.S. of interfering in its internal affairs.

          <p>Experts say that while paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, it's not the only factor, and not all payments are factored into credit scores. Payments like rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities may not be reported to credit bureaus. Additionally, on-time payments for buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not help your credit score, and missed payments can negatively impact it.

          <p>Mortgage applications decreased by 3.9% last week, despite a slight dip in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to 6.92%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance applications fell by 4% for the week but were 42% higher than the same week last year, while applications for home purchases also decreased by 4% but were 18% higher year-over-year. According to Joel Kan, an MBA economist, refinance activity declined across both conventional and government segments as potential borrowers await larger rate drops. The main driver of increased purchase demand is more supply on the market, although sales should be even stronger given the highest supply level in five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Executives at major corporations, including Target, Goldman Sachs, and Pepsi, have expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Recent court rulings have added another layer of instability, causing companies to put hiring and investment plans on hold. Experts warn that this paralysis could hinder economic momentum and potentially lead to a downturn. The Trump administration defends its tariff approach as a strategic tool for trade negotiations, but companies fear potential losses due to the lack of clarity, which is creating an anxious environment for both businesses and consumers.

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has implemented a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, effective Wednesday, while responding to what the FBI has called an "act of terror" during a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado.

On Capitol Hill, the Senate is focusing on a megabill to fund Trump's agenda, as the administration seeks to advance its economic and trade policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed criminal charges against former Atlanta police officer Sung Kim in the death of Jimmy Atchison, ruling that Kim's actions were "textbook self-defense." Kim was indicted on charges including involuntary manslaughter and felony murder after fatally shooting Atchison, who was wanted for armed robbery, during an arrest operation in 2019. The judge cited Supremacy Clause immunity and self-defense immunity, stating that Atchison made a sudden move towards Kim, leading the officer to believe he was in danger. Kim's attorney stated that the prosecution was an inexcusable abuse of prosecutorial discretion, while Atchison's family expressed disappointment.</p>

          <p>Counterpoint Research has sharply reduced its forecasts for Apple and Samsung shipment growth in 2025, citing uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy and weakened demand in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. The research firm lowered its global smartphone shipment growth forecast from 4.2% to 1.9% year-on-year. While tariffs have played a role, weakened demand is also a significant factor, particularly for Apple, which faces scrutiny due to its reliance on China for iPhone production. Huawei is expected to be a bright spot, with an anticipated 11% year-on-year shipment growth due to easing sourcing bottlenecks.</p>

          <p>New data indicates that the average number of sick days taken by UK workers has decreased, with an estimated 148.9 million working days lost due to illness or injury in 2024. This equates to 2% of total working hours, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from the previous year. Minor illnesses were the most frequent cause of absence, followed by musculoskeletal problems, and women, older employees, and those with long-term health issues had the highest rates of sick leave. Advocates are calling for sick pay reform, arguing that many workers are forced to work while ill due to financial constraints.</p>

The National Trust has removed the piece from display to investigate the damage and consider next steps. The artwork has sparked controversy due to Rowling's views on gender identity, which have drawn both support and criticism.</p>

However, her release is not guaranteed, as the governor has the authority to veto parole decisions in notorious cases. Supporters emphasize her remorse, rehabilitation, and the impact of abuse and trauma in her past, arguing that she has demonstrated a commitment to helping others and should be given a chance at freedom.</p>
