Dr. Salha stated that the hospital staff were threatened with being killed or the hospital being bombed if they did not comply with the evacuation order.

          <p>British comedian Russell Brand pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault, in a London court. The charges stem from four separate alleged incidents involving different women between 1999 and 2005. Brand, who has previously denied the allegations, appeared in court clutching a collection of Puritan prayers. His trial is scheduled to begin on June 3, 2026, and is expected to last four to five weeks.</p>

          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging to mislead customers into buying store-brand versions. The lawsuit claims that Aldi's products, such as Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies and Thin Wheat, mimic the packaging design elements of Mondelez's popular snacks. Mondelez is seeking monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products. Aldi has faced similar lawsuits in the past regarding its product packaging.</p>

          <p>Despite JPMorgan Chase's increasing profitability and crucial role in the U.S. economy, CEO Jamie Dimon consistently expresses a pessimistic outlook on the economy and geopolitical landscape. While Dimon's leadership has led to record profits for JPMorgan, his economic predictions have not always been accurate, causing some to question his motives. Some speculate that Dimon's cautious remarks are intended to keep his management team focused on future risks and prevent complacency. Regardless, JPMorgan continues to thrive, driven by its size, technological investments, and Dimon's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization that he previously relied on for judicial nominations. Trump expressed disappointment with the Society's advice on judicial nominations and accused Leonard Leo, a co-chair of the Society's board, of having "separate ambitions" and being a "sleazebag." This split could diminish both Trump's power and the Society's influence in the long run, potentially altering the composition of the judiciary. Trump's criticism followed a court decision striking down some of his tariffs, with one of the judges being a Trump appointee.</p>

          <p>Investors should monitor gold prices closely this June, with potential for another price spike due to inflation data and Federal Reserve meetings. While the price is down from a recent record high, experts predict it could rise again, possibly reaching $4,000 per ounce. Gold prices typically increase over time, making it a reliable hedge against inflation and a tangible asset for portfolio diversification. Cost-effective ways to invest, such as fractional gold and dollar-cost averaging, are still available, but gold should be limited to 10% or less of the overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

These departures follow similar withdrawals by Nissan, Adidas, and Clorox, posing operational challenges for the event, which attracts 3 million attendees annually. Organizers fear they may have to drastically cut the festival in 2026 due to the financial impact. This trend reflects a broader pullback from corporate sponsorship of LGBTQ+ events, influenced by the White House’s condemnation of DEI efforts.</p>
