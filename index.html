          <h2>Trump Plans to Deploy Additional National Guard Troops to Los Angeles Amid Protests</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that President Trump intends to deploy an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, criticizing the move as an ego-driven decision unrelated to public safety. Newsom also mentioned that the initial 2,000 troops deployed lacked essential supplies, with many remaining unused in federal buildings. Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta are suing Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, challenging the federalization of the California National Guard as unlawful and a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit argues that Trump's action infringes on Newsom's authority and exceeds federal law, marking the first instance since 1965 of a president activating a state's National Guard without the governor's request.</p>

          <p>Police in New York City arrested 24 anti-ICE protesters who occupied the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, chanting slogans and reading names of deported immigrants. The protests, sparked by violent demonstrations in Los Angeles following ICE operations that led to arrests, spread across the country. Among those arrested in Los Angeles was an illegal alien from Vietnam with a prior conviction for second-degree murder for a shooting at a high school graduation party, killing two teenagers and injuring seven others. A Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary questioned why California officials seemed more concerned about violent criminals than protecting their own citizens, as Democratic lawmakers criticized President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in response to the protests. </p>

Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), claiming it had become a "rubber stamp" for vaccines.

Kennedy's move follows months of controversy over his changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, defunding of bird flu vaccine research, and spreading of misinformation about measles shots.

Mark Davids, co-head of Asia-Pacific equities, suggests investors should carefully screen stocks and sectors to identify potential winners. Chinese stocks have rallied this year, but global investors remain underweight, indicating that an improvement in the profitability of Chinese companies is needed for a sustained re-rating.

          <p>The government has committed Â£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while critics like Alison Downes condemned the move as a costly mistake. The final investment decision on the funding model is due later this summer, amidst opposition at local and national levels. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are engaged in a heated dispute over the handling of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles. Trump has deployed National Guard members, while Newsom has requested their removal and is suing the Trump administration, claiming the federalization of the National Guard is illegal. The conflict has become highly politicized, with both sides accusing each other of exacerbating the situation for political gain. The situation has put Newsom back in the national spotlight and at the center of a contentious political issue.</p>
