          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones. The concept involves fitting small drones with side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion," allowing them to perform high-G maneuvers to dodge incoming missiles in the final seconds of an attack. Digital simulations, detailed in a Chinese defense journal, showed this system could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent. This innovation aims to counter sophisticated air defense systems that have proven effective against current drone technology.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman was killed and another person was seriously injured after being mauled by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. When police arrived, they encountered several canines, believed to be strays, and an injured woman. As an officer assisted her, two more dogs charged, prompting the officer to shoot and kill one of them. The deceased victim, Teodora Mendoza, was found nearby with severe injuries and later died at a hospital, with authorities removing 14 dogs from the park.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a global network of online groups dedicated to sharing graphic videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. With thousands of members, including some in the UK, these groups operate on encrypted messaging apps, where they sell and distribute footage of extreme animal cruelty. Evidence suggests some UK-based members discussed adopting kittens from the RSPCA for the purpose of abuse. Animal rights activists have documented a new video of a cat being tortured or killed being uploaded approximately every 14 hours.</p>

          <p>In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Avril Benoit, CEO of Doctors Without Borders USA, described the harrowing humanitarian situation in Gaza, including a manmade famine and catastrophic trauma injuries. She detailed how civilians are being killed or injured at chaotic aid distribution sites, not just by airstrikes but also by gunfire and trampling. When the host shifted the focus to a video of a malnourished Israeli hostage released by Hamas, Benoit acknowledged the horrific situation for hostages while reiterating that Israel's control over aid is starving everyone in the territory, including captives and aid workers.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade negotiations, China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to stop buying oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will secure its energy supply based on national interests. The U.S. had threatened a 100% tariff to pressure Beijing, aiming to cut off revenue for Moscow's war in Ukraine and Tehran's military activities. Despite this friction, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed optimism that a broader trade deal could still be reached. Analysts suggest China is confident in its position, questioning whether the U.S. would risk derailing progress by enforcing such a severe tariff.</p>

          <p>To combat record-high infection rates, sexual health clinics across the UK have begun rolling out a vaccination program for gonorrhoea. The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, will initially be offered to high-risk groups, such as gay and bisexual men with multiple partners. Health officials hope the program, which is a world-first, will prevent up to 100,000 cases over the next decade and help slow the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains. Gonorrhoea cases in 2023 surpassed 85,000, the highest number since record-keeping began nearly a century ago.</p>

Ramsey advocates for a strict financial plan that includes creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the "debt snowball" method, and paying for purchases with cash. He emphasizes that income is a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if it is not given away to lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson narrowly missed out on a spot in the 200m final at the US Track and Field Championships, ending her bid to compete in the event at the upcoming World Championships. She finished her heat just one-hundredth of a second behind the final qualifier. This comes during a difficult week for the athlete, who was arrested over a domestic violence allegation. As the defending 100m world champion, Richardson automatically has a spot to compete in that event, but she will not be able to race the 200m.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described himself as "useless" after a difficult weekend at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he qualified 12th and finished in the same position. His Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc, started on pole, highlighting a performance gap that left Hamilton deeply frustrated. Despite his mood, Hamilton dismissed rumors of quitting and affirmed his commitment to returning after the summer break. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed understanding for Hamilton's frustration but remained confident in the driver's ability to bounce back, attributing the poor result partly to a failed race strategy.</p>

          <p>The recent sale of the iconic American company U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel includes an unusual provision granting President Donald Trump significant influence over the company's future. The terms of the deal reportedly give Trump a "golden share," a mechanism that provides special voting or veto rights over key corporate decisions. This arrangement gives the U.S. president an outsized say in the strategic direction of a major industrial company now under foreign ownership. The article highlights this unique intersection of corporate finance and executive power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a jobs report showed downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, while Trump had claimed the numbers were "rigged." The firing drew sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warned it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue the administration is "shooting the messenger" for politically inconvenient economic news.</p>
