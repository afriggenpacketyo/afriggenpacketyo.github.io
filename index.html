Analysts have revised sales estimates upward, citing stable consumer spending and the industry's ability to navigate economic uncertainty, though concerns about a "K-shaped" recovery persist. Automakers like GM and Ford are still expected to report earnings declines, but the sector's overall performance has exceeded bearish expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

The unprovoked attack was captured on video and is part of a recent surge in settler violence targeting Palestinians during the annual olive harvest. Human rights monitors note that such attacks are often intended to intimidate Palestinians from their land, with the vast majority of perpetrators facing no legal consequences.</p>

          <p>Following a bold heist at the Louvre Museum, experts are contemplating the destination of priceless stolen French crown jewels from the Napoleon III era. While well-known artworks are difficult to sell, historical jewelry can be dismantled for its precious metals and gems, though specialists believe the thieves may try to keep these identifiable pieces intact. The incident is the latest in a series of major art thefts, often linked to organized crime networks that use stolen cultural heritage as currency in illegal trades.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate supported by left-wing parties, has won the Turkish Cypriot leadership election with a decisive 62.8% of the vote. His victory is seen as a strong message in favor of resuming negotiations for a federal solution to the Cyprus problem, rejecting the two-state policy pursued by his predecessor and Turkey. Erhurman's campaign also emphasized preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived interference from Ankara, a stance that resonated strongly with voters.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest has fired manager Ange Postecoglou just 40 days after his appointment, following a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea. The move was seen as inevitable, as Postecoglou's high-pressing, attacking style of football was a fundamental mismatch for a squad that found success last season by playing a deep, counter-attacking game. The brief and ill-fated tenure raises questions about the decision-making of both the club's owner and Postecoglou himself for entering into such an obviously incompatible partnership.</p>

          <p>President Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. could severely impact the global film industry, with Britain's sector being particularly vulnerable. The UK film and TV industry relies heavily on investment from U.S. studios, which accounted for 65% of production spending last year. Industry experts and politicians warn that such a tariff, while potentially impractical to enforce, could jeopardize thousands of jobs and hinder the creation of British films that depend on international collaboration.</p>

This year's report noted a trend of previously affordable cities, particularly in Texas, becoming unaffordable due to rising rents, likely driven by an influx of new residents.</p>
