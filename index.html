          <p>European leaders are voicing strong opposition to a potential U.S.-Russia peace deal that could exclude Ukraine, emphasizing that Kyiv must be involved in any decisions about its future. The concerns follow President Trump's announcement of a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where reports suggest a deal could cede Ukrainian territory to Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any agreements made without his country's participation, stating such actions would undermine peace and reward Russian aggression. The joint European statement reinforces that international borders cannot be changed by force.</p>

          <p>Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over a tribute to former Palestinian player Suleiman al-Obeid. Salah highlighted that UEFA's statement failed to mention the circumstances of al-Obeid's death, which the Palestinian Football Association attributes to an Israeli forces attack during an aid distribution in Gaza. Known as the "Palestinian Pele," al-Obeid's death has drawn attention from other figures in the football world who have also expressed sorrow over the conflict. The incident underscores the ongoing tension and the impact of the conflict on the sports community.</p>

It remembers him not just for his on-field talent but for his profound humility, gratitude, and deep connection to his roots, remaining close to those who supported him from his early days. Friends, former coaches, and teammates recall him as an "ordinary boy living in a world of superstars" who never forgot where he came from. The piece highlights his character through anecdotes, such as inviting his former dormitory caretaker to his wedding and forgoing gifts for charitable donations.</p>

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, Wang Xingxing, predicts that robotics could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While acknowledging that current hardware is sufficient, Wang states that the "AI for embodied intelligence" remains the critical missing piece. He expressed some skepticism about current models but suggested that new approaches, like generating interactive models from text prompts, show greater promise.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to stop all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage affecting 9,200 households. The disruption began Tuesday when a critical water control valve broke during a heatwave, and a boil water advisory was subsequently issued. Efforts to repair the system are being hampered as continued water use prevents a large reservoir tank from pressurizing, which is essential for restoring normal service. A subsequent failure of a temporary bypass pipe has caused further delays to the complex underground repairs.</p>

          <p>Northern China is experiencing another year of severe flooding during its traditional rainy season, with Beijing being hit particularly hard by deadly floods for the fifth time since 2012.

In contrast, previous major flooding events in 2016 and 2023 primarily affected the city's southern regions. The recurring nature of these severe weather events highlights the persistent environmental challenges facing the area.</p>

The piece expresses alarm at the lack of widespread public opposition, contrasting the current "eerie silence" with the passionate anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s.

          <p>The rapidly advancing Lee Fire in northwest Colorado has prompted the evacuation of a state prison. Officials announced that all 179 inmates from the minimum-security Rifle Correctional Center were being safely transferred to other secure facilities outside the fire zone. As of Saturday evening, the wildfire had consumed over 92,000 acres, making it one of the largest in the state's recent history, with only 6% containment. Shifting winds have accelerated the fire's southern spread, leading to new evacuation orders in the surrounding counties.</p>
