          <p>The ongoing technology competition between the United States and China will ultimately be decided by global consumers, according to this opinion article. While the U.S. currently leads in most technological areas, China is rapidly closing the gap by emphasizing cost-effective alternatives and building a robust manufacturing supply chain. Chinese firms like Huawei and SMIC are commercializing advanced chips and equipment, offering viable options in a growing downstream market. As both nations introduce advanced tech, market share has become a key battleground for economic power, military influence, and the ability to set global industry standards.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack has voiced significant concern over the state of U.S. inflation, noting that the central bank has missed its 2% target for over four years. She highlighted particular worries about persistent price pressures within the services sector. Hammack described the current environment as a "challenging time for monetary policy," as the Fed must balance its dual mandate of fighting inflation and protecting employment. Her remarks follow a recent interest rate cut and stronger-than-expected economic data, which has tempered market expectations for further rapid easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russell M. Nelson, the 17th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has passed away in Salt Lake City at the age of 101. A revered figure and trained surgeon, Dr. Nelson became the oldest serving head of the church and was credited with leading significant policy changes during his presidency, which began in 2018. Notably, he oversaw the reversal of controversial anti-LGBT policies from 2015 and severed the church's long-standing ties with the Boy Scouts of America. Before his full-time church service, he was a pioneering heart surgeon who performed the first open-heart surgery in Utah.</p>

          <p>India's victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup cricket final was marked by a significant political gesture, as the Indian players refused to accept the championship trophy from the Pakistani Interior Minister. The incident delayed the presentation ceremony for over an hour and was the latest in a series of tense moments during the tournament, including a refusal to shake hands. The controversy reflects the heightened political rivalry between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which recently engaged in a brief military conflict. While the Indian captain stated the team was denied the trophy, he emphasized that being declared champions was what mattered most.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that the mysterious collapse of the ancient Sanxingdui civilization in southwestern China may have been caused by internal conflict. According to Sun Hua, a scholar at the Sanxingdui Research Institute, a war for control of the capital city likely occurred during its later period. This conflict led to the destruction of city walls, alterations to the water system, and the disappearance of key religious sites, ultimately spurring a population exodus. The Sanxingdui ruins, dating back about 4,500 years, are considered one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century.</p>

He fostered a quiet confidence within the team, utilized data analytics from vice-captain Edoardo Molinari, and ensured players were well-rested by arriving in New York nearly two weeks early.

The scheme builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will be funded from existing budgets, with full details to be revealed in the upcoming November Budget.

          <p>As autumn approaches, UK health officials are warning of a potential surge in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their overlapping symptoms. While flu often presents suddenly with fever, aches, and exhaustion, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now resemble a common cold, though fever, cough, and loss of taste or smell remain possible. A hoarse throat has become a notable feature of recent COVID-19 variants. Officials emphasize that vaccination is the most effective defense against severe illness from both viruses and are urging all eligible individuals to get their flu shots and COVID-19 boosters to protect themselves and reduce strain on the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is creating a potential two-tier system that benefits the wealthy, as access through the UK's NHS is tightly restricted.

Experts warn this could worsen existing health inequalities, as obesity rates are significantly higher in more deprived areas. With varying eligibility criteria creating a "postcode lottery" for NHS prescriptions, the vast majority of users are paying out-of-pocket, effectively turning a health solution into a luxury.</p>

BYD is now offering discounts of up to 1 million yen (US$6,700), which, combined with government subsidies, can reduce sticker prices by half.

          <p>The new Netflix historical drama "House of Guinness," created by "Peaky Blinders" writer Steven Knight, used Penrhyn Castle in North Wales as a primary filming location. The 19th-century neo-Norman castle stands in for the Guinness family's ancestral home in the series, which chronicles the dynasty's story following the death of Sir Benjamin Guinness in 1868. Producers chose the location for its architectural parallels to the real Ashford Castle in Ireland. The series, starring James Norton, explores the impact of Benjamin Guinness's will on his four children as they inherit the world's largest brewery.</p>

          <p>An Oxfordshire widow, Mimi Conder, is advocating for a new law that would require police to provide dedicated support to families bereaved by suicide. After her husband Jason's death, she found the official processes, including the police investigation and inquest, to be confusing and overwhelming with no aftercare provided. Her petition for "Jason's Law" calls for a family support officer (FLO) to be assigned in such cases to guide relatives through the procedures. Currently, Thames Valley Police deploy FLOs primarily for criminal investigations, not for deaths that are not considered suspicious.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused severe flooding across parts of Arizona, leading to the confirmed deaths of at least three people. In the city of Globe, two people died and others are potentially missing after a massive amount of rain fell in a short period, prompting a large-scale search and rescue operation. The flood also dislodged approximately 1,000 propane tanks from a distributor, creating a widespread hazardous materials situation. In suburban Phoenix, another person was found dead near a vehicle that had been submerged in fast-moving floodwaters, highlighting the extreme danger posed by the weather event.</p>

          <p>Two veterinarians are renewing calls for the management of a rare breed of wild sheep on the remote Scottish archipelago of St Kilda, arguing that hundreds starve to death each winter. The Soay sheep, which roam freely on the island of Hirta, suffer from a lack of sufficient grazing due to overpopulation. The vets contend that since the sheep are descended from domesticated animals, they should not be left to suffer, and propose a culling program to reduce their numbers. However, the National Trust for Scotland and the Scottish government classify the sheep as wild animals not covered by farm animal welfare laws.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new memoir, "107 Days," which covers her presidential campaign, portrays her as a politician lacking in self-awareness and overly focused on the spectacle of politics rather than substantive policy. The book reveals a candidate who leaned heavily on celebrity endorsements and positive media feedback, seemingly unable to connect with voters outside her bubble. According to the article, the memoir shows little evidence that she would have meaningfully diverged from the Biden administration's policies. The reviewer concludes that the campaign's failure was not due to a lack of time but to a candidate who invests too much in presentation.</p>

          <p>A BBC cybersecurity correspondent has shared his first-hand experience of being targeted by a criminal hacking group in an attempt to recruit him as an insider threat. The reporter was contacted by a representative of the Medusa ransomware gang and offered a 25% cut of a potential multi-million dollar ransom payment in exchange for his BBC login credentials. After he engaged with the hacker to learn about their methods, the criminals became impatient and launched an "MFA bombing" attack, flooding his phone with login notifications to pressure him. The incident provides a chilling insight into how cybercriminals leverage insiders to breach corporate networks.</p>

The Met stated that concerns have been raised about the potential impact of such memberships on impartiality, promotions, and misconduct investigations.

          <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that China's central bank is increasingly likely to implement monetary easing measures in the fourth quarter to support slowing economic growth. The forecast suggests a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This projection follows a recent central bank meeting where officials maintained a dovish stance but offered few new signals. The bank's more cautious description of the economy, shifting from "showing positive momentum" to "making strides while maintaining stability," was noted as a subtle indicator of a changing outlook.
