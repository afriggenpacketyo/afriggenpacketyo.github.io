            <h2>Potential iPhone Price Increases Loom Due to Tariffs on Chinese Goods</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 10:07:20 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>As the Trump administration implements tariffs on goods imported from China, the potential impact on iPhone prices in the United States is under scrutiny. While Apple has not yet revealed plans to pass tariff costs onto consumers, analysts suggest that US iPhone prices could significantly increase if costs are fully transferred, potentially reaching thousands of dollars. The company's strong brand loyalty might allow it to pass on some costs without major backlash, but relocating supply chains from Asia to the U.S. would be a complex and expensive undertaking.

            <p>A deal between striking Birmingham bin workers and the city council was reportedly hindered by interventions from Unite's national leadership, according to sources familiar with the situation. The dispute, centered on job role losses and pay cuts, has resulted in thousands of tonnes of rubbish accumulating on the city's streets, prompting a major incident declaration. While local union members were allegedly close to an agreement, national figures rejected it, sparking concerns about power struggles within Unite. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner urged striking workers to accept an improved deal to resolve the ongoing disruption.</p>

President Trump has been personally involved in pushing for the budget's adoption. The House faces a tight deadline to pass the measure before a two-week recess.</p>

            <p>Texas Republican Representative Lance Gooden has endorsed state Attorney General Ken Paxton in the upcoming GOP Senate primary, setting the stage for a potentially nasty and expensive intra-party battle against incumbent Senator John Cornyn. Gooden, known as a MAGA firebrand, believes Paxton will champion conservative values and support President Trump's agenda. Cornyn, who has the backing of Senate leadership, faces a tough re-election challenge amid accusations of not being conservative enough, while Paxton faces scrutiny over past legal troubles. The race may be further complicated by a potential bid from Representative Wesley Hunt.</p>

            <p>The US-China trade war escalates into a strategic battle as Washington raises tariffs on Beijing to 125 per cent, despite a 90-day reprieve for other nations. Chinese analysts view the situation as a test of strategic resolve, with no near-term negotiations in sight. While Trump expresses openness to talks, China insists on fair and mutually respectful negotiations. Both sides indicate a willingness to "fight to the end" if the US pursues a trade war. This escalation signifies a shift from mere tariff disputes to a broader competition of strategic determination.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% annually in March, slightly below expectations, signaling progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to curb inflation. Monthly prices experienced a 0.1% decrease, the first in nearly five years, primarily driven by lower fuel and travel costs. However, experts caution that tariffs could potentially cause inflation to rise later in the year, as the impact of import duties gradually affects the economy. Despite the recent easing, inflationary risks remain a concern, particularly with some tariffs still in effect or merely delayed.</p>

Trump reportedly stated his willingness to accept "pain" associated with the policy. Bond yields soared and equities plummeted before Trump rolled back some retaliatory tariffs. Kevin Hassett, director of the U.S. National Economic Council, attributed the bond market decline as a factor in Trump's decision, with the 10-year Treasury yield spiking above 4.5% amid speculation of foreign bond dumping.</p>

The current spending disparity between teams has fueled the debate, with some arguing that a salary cap would promote competitive balance and benefit players by tying salaries to league revenue.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences unveiled genetically modified wolves, claiming they've "de-extincted" dire wolves. However, these are hybridized modern wolves with limited genetic modifications. This raises ethical concerns about using animals for research and spectacle. De-extinction faces technical and ethical challenges, risking harm to surrogate parents and cloned animals. The focus should be on conserving existing species and addressing human behavior to ensure the survival of revived endangered animals, rather than playing God for commercial opportunities.</p>

            <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, saving money can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can offer a solution by providing higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in today's high rates for the term, and they are generally safe investments with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Short-term CDs often offer the best rates today due to the inverted yield curve, and online banks tend to have more competitive rates. Laddering CDs, by buying some with one-year terms, some with two-year terms, and some with three-year terms, is a practical approach to taking advantage of high rates while saving for the long term.

            <p>In the current housing market, characterized by high mortgage rates and limited inventory, it's crucial to stay informed about interest rate trends. Average mortgage rates are 6.70% for a 30-year mortgage and 5.96% for a 15-year mortgage, while refinance rates are 6.79% for a 30-year refinance and 6.12% for a 15-year refinance. Strengthening your credit profile and shopping around for different lenders are key to securing a good rate. Consider your loan term, fees, and overall payment when choosing a mortgage or refinance loan, and make sure to lock in your rate after making your decision. (not investment advice)</p>

The law has also limited women's access to public spaces and health care, and has prevented UN agencies from delivering services.

While the idea of concentrating weight in the bat's sweet spot seems logical, physicists argue that a bat's power depends on the overall weight distribution, not just one area. The bats may feel lighter, allowing for faster swings, but this could also reduce force upon contact. The trend highlights the data-driven approach of modern baseball, while also suggesting that superstition and individual preference still play a significant role.</p>
