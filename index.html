          <p>Elon Musk's Boring Company has proposed a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville, sparking a partisan conflict. Republican state leaders, including Governor Bill Lee, support the privately funded "Music City Loop," while Democratic lawmakers raise concerns about the lack of public input, environmental assessments, and transparency. The project, intended to connect downtown to the airport, is moving forward with state-level approvals, bypassing local oversight and prompting criticism over a no-cost land lease to the company. This situation highlights growing tensions surrounding Musk's business dealings and political influence in the state.</p>

The committee, investigating the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, has subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition but has refused to consider immunity. Maxwell's lawyer argued that testifying without such protections would compromise her ongoing legal appeals and constitutional rights, threatening she would otherwise invoke the Fifth Amendment. Meanwhile, relatives of victim Virginia Giuffre have strongly opposed any leniency for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela, by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic and other lethal substances. Prosecutors argued the crime was driven by greed, citing $4 million in life insurance policies and Craig's extramarital affairs, while presenting evidence of his incriminating internet searches. The defense had suggested the possibility of suicide, but the jury convicted Craig on all charges, including soliciting an inmate to kill the lead investigator. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year and missed market expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 94% slump in profits from its crucial chip division, attributed to inventory value adjustments and costs from export restrictions related to China. While overall revenue saw a slight increase, the poor performance of the semiconductor business overshadowed it. The company plans to focus on high-demand AI-related products to bolster its performance in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed the lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution, civil rights violations, and defamation, claiming he was unfairly targeted for political or professional gain. The case was dismissed without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. His attorney stated that they have been engaged in good-faith settlement discussions and will refile if a favorable resolution is not reached promptly.</p>

The demonstration, captured on video, was sponsored by groups including the Southern Wisconsin Grassroots Network and the Working Families Party. Rep.

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the airport's own long-standing plan. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex task of diverting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be cheaper, reduce risk, and could be operational by 2035, costing under £25 billion. This development introduces the first-ever competitive bidding process for the airport's expansion, a project that has faced numerous delays due to costs, legal challenges, and the pandemic.</p>

This move breaks from the long-standing U.S. position and isolates the Trump administration, which boycotted a recent UN conference on the matter, calling it a "publicity stunt." The article suggests the Trump administration lacks a coherent long-term plan for Gaza's future beyond the removal of Hamas, effectively aligning its strategy with that of the Israeli government.

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis indicates that President Trump's aggressive tariff policies are having tangible effects on the U.S. economy, though not always as intended. While government tariff revenue has tripled, the overall U.S. goods trade deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling imports to avoid the taxes. The tariffs have significantly reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has successfully shifted trade to other partners. Economists are now observing early signs that these tariffs are beginning to raise U.S. consumer prices on certain imported goods, despite the inflation rate remaining relatively stable for now.

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that a body recovered from the Kaweah River in Sequoia National Park belongs to Jomarie Calasanz, who went missing two months ago. Calasanz was swept away by the river's strong current on May 25 while trying to help her sister, who was also struggling in the water. The recovery operation was hampered for weeks by the dangerously fast-moving water, which required search teams to wait for conditions to improve. Her body was ultimately found less than a mile from where she was last seen, bringing a tragic conclusion to the prolonged search effort.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has issued a consumer warning after a production error led to some cans of Celsius energy drinks being filled with vodka. The mistake occurred when a packaging supplier sent empty Celsius cans for the "Astro Vibe Blue Razz" edition to the High Noon vodka seltzer company. As a result, both the affected Celsius drinks and some High Noon Beach Variety packs from the same production line are being recalled. The products were distributed in six states, and consumers are advised to check lot codes and dispose of any impacted cans.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explain Why Massive Russia Earthquake Resulted in Minimal Tsunami Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 18:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula caused surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this fortunate outcome. While the sparsely populated area near the epicenter saw significant waves, the main energy of the tsunami was directed into the open Pacific, largely between Alaska and Hawaii. This allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated coastlines like the U.S. West Coast, where wave heights were minimal.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer explained that the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates due to a highly mixed and uncertain economic environment. He noted that while some indicators, like a struggling housing market, might support a rate cut, other factors like a strong labor market and unclear inflationary pressures from tariffs make the decision difficult. According to Cramer, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is avoiding a premature move that could allow inflation to resurge. He believes the market's negative reaction was due to the Fed not signaling the inevitability of future cuts, creating uncertainty for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting an estimated $2 billion net impact from the import taxes. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations but also recorded a small net loss due to special charges, including a major vehicle recall. The company's updated guidance is lower than its pre-tariff forecast, reflecting the significant costs associated with the administration's trade policies. Ford's EV division continued to post substantial losses, while its commercial "Pro" business remained a key growth engine. (not investment advice)</p>

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of providing "cagey answers" and ignoring his directives, suggesting they may be trying to "run out the clock on the fiscal year" without using the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA. The agency has been largely non-operational since March, following the appointment of a Trump adviser who oversaw the loss of 85% of its staff.</p>

This growth was largely fueled by its Azure cloud computing business, which the company disclosed had generated over $75 billion in revenue for the fiscal year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the era of "comfort TV" may be waning, as audiences and critics increasingly embrace shows that induce anxiety and reflect real-world stress. Series like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" utilize high-pressure scenarios and hyperrealistic filmmaking to create a visceral tension that resonates with viewers. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be satisfying, as it allows audiences to experience a fight-or-flight response without any actual risk. The trend may also reflect a desire for more grounded, sincere storytelling that acknowledges the mundane, high-stakes challenges of modern work and life, particularly among younger audiences.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has publicly criticized the UK government's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." The former hostage stated that making recognition conditional on a ceasefire disincentivizes Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages, as they would lose that leverage if they agreed to a deal. Lawyers representing the families of British hostages echoed these concerns, imploring the UK prime minister to provide clarity that Hamas will not be rewarded. The reaction highlights the deep emotional and political complexities surrounding international diplomatic efforts in the conflict.</p>
