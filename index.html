          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to uphold the constitutionality of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a body that recommends no-cost preventive care under the Affordable Care Act. The decision reverses a lower court ruling, affirming that the task force's members are "inferior officers" who can be appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This ruling ensures continued access to free services like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention medication, which were challenged by a group of Christian-owned businesses on religious grounds.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index achieved a new all-time high, climbing to 6,156 as investors looked past concerns about trade tensions and Middle East conflicts. The market has surged over 20% since an April low, fueled by a more moderate tariff stance from the Trump administration and signs of continued economic health.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump, were intentionally false and malicious. Newsom's legal action, filed in Delaware, claims the network was motivated to distort facts on behalf of the president, and the specific damages sought mirror the amount Fox News paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit.</p>

It recounts Trump's sharp retorts to Biden's statements on Medicare and the border, as well as a heated exchange over Trump's alleged comments about military service members, framing the event as a turning point in the campaign.</p>

This change aligns the U.S. edition with other international versions of the magazine and will allow Wintour to focus more on her broader global and corporate responsibilities after leading U.S. Vogue since 1988.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has made concessions on his government's welfare reform bill following a significant rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The original plan aimed to save Â£5 billion by making it harder for people to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip), but stricter criteria will now apply only to new claimants, not existing ones. While this move has satisfied some rebels, a faction of MPs on the left of the party still plan to vote against the bill, highlighting internal divisions over disability benefits and government strategy.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court limited the authority of individual federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block federal government policies. The ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court focused on the procedural issue rather than the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that judicial relief should not be "broader than necessary" to protect the specific plaintiffs, a move seen as a victory for the executive branch's power.</p>

          <p>The UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, has addressed reports that the paternal grandfather of its incoming chief, Blaise Metreweli, was a Nazi spy known as "the butcher." The Foreign Office stated that Ms. Metreweli, who will be the first female head of the agency, never knew or met her grandfather, Constantine Dobrowolski. It added that her complex family heritage, marked by conflict, has contributed to her commitment to protecting the UK from modern threats, turning a potentially damaging revelation into a narrative of dedication to public service.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he deeply regrets using the phrase "an island of strangers" in a May speech about immigration, acknowledging its echo of Enoch Powell's infamous 1968 "Rivers of Blood" speech. In an interview, Starmer said neither he nor his speechwriters were aware of the historical parallel and that he wouldn't have used the words if he had known. The admission has drawn anger from some of his own loyalists, who view it as weak and an attempt to shift blame onto his aides.</p>

However, the article notes the company's history of unprofitability and a negative gross margin on its fuel business, suggesting these signs may not be sufficient to warrant investment.

          <p>This long-form essay describes Tehran as two parallel cities: the visible city of ordinary life and an "invisible city" of state control, surveillance, and hidden operations. The author, a former political prisoner, recounts personal experiences with this secret infrastructure of unmarked buildings, safe houses, and constant monitoring by the regime's intelligence apparatus. The article argues that the recent Israeli airstrikes, by targeting military and nuclear assets embedded within civilian areas, have briefly and violently made this invisible city visible to the world, exposing the deep structure of the Islamic Republic's power.</p>
