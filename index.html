            <h2>Survey Indicates Tariffs Will Not Spur US Manufacturing Resurgence</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 13:02:49 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Companies surveyed believe that reshoring would double costs, with 61% finding it more cost-effective to relocate to lower-tariff countries. The survey also highlights concerns over consumer demand, raw material prices, and the administration's inconsistent strategy. Furthermore, automation is expected to dominate any potential return of manufacturing to the U.S., reducing reliance on human workers, and most respondents anticipate job cuts in the near future due to tariff impacts.

The comments come after the implementation of 25% automotive tariffs on imported vehicles, with domestic manufacturers announcing temporary deals and foreign manufacturers responding in various ways, such as ceasing U.S. shipments.

            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller anticipates that President Trump's tariffs will have a "transitory" impact on inflation, a term previously used during the 2021 inflation spike. Waller outlined two scenarios: larger tariffs causing a 4%-5% inflation spike that eventually subsides, and smaller tariffs resulting in a 3% increase. Regardless, he expects the Fed to cut interest rates, with the timing dependent on the tariff size. Waller used a football analogy to defend his "transitory" inflation view, emphasizing the need for flexibility in policymaking due to the economic uncertainties created by the tariffs.

The council claims the offer on the table was a fair one, while suggesting "every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages."

            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the conditions in Gaza hospitals as "beyond description" following Israeli attacks. A major facility, al-Ahli hospital, was put out of service by an Israeli air strike, destroying its laboratory and damaging its emergency room. The Israeli military claimed it targeted a "command-and-control centre" used by Hamas. The Church of England, which runs the hospital, has called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim, while the WHO has reiterated that hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law.</p>

A separate 20% tariff on all Chinese goods is still in effect. The situation adds more uncertainty about Trump's tariff policy, which has changed repeatedly since he took office.</p>
