          <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of murder and conspiracy for masterminding her husband Fabio's 2017 slaying, culminating an eight-year legal battle. Prosecutors argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, for financial gain and to be together. The comprehensive article details the investigation from the crime scene, including Baker's DNA, to Monica's alibi and their secretive romance. The case saw Baker plead no contest, and another co-conspirator, Christopher Austin, plead guilty. Monica Sementilli was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without parole, with plans to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>Four individuals have been charged in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton last month, which resulted in £7 million worth of damage to military planes. Amy Gardiner-Gibson, Jony Cink, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie, and Lewie Chiaramello face charges of conspiracy to enter a prohibited place prejudicial to UK safety and conspiracy to commit criminal damage. The damage, caused by spraying paint on two Voyager aircraft during the June 20 incident, prompted Counter Terrorism Policing South East to bring these charges. The accused are scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court.</p>

          <p>Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the 2017 murder of Fabio Sementilli, maintained his former lover Monica Sementilli's innocence in an interview with "48 Hours" before her trial.

He claimed his sole motive was to have Monica for himself, dismissing circumstantial evidence like shared security credentials or encrypted communications as innocent.

          <p>Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines is urging the NCAA to amend or rescind all records set by transgender athlete Lia Thomas, following the University of Pennsylvania's decision to erase Thomas' program records. Gaines, who competed against Thomas, is leading a lawsuit against the NCAA's policies, advocating for fairness in women's sports. The issue has gained political traction, with the White House, under President Trump, asserting that Title IX mandates adherence to federal law on the matter, suggesting potential prosecution for violators. Gaines supports such prosecution, believing current policies criminalize the disregard for women's safety and rights in sports, and calls for university officials to be charged.</p>

Shohei Ohtani, already a confirmed starter, will be joined by catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman. This outcome leaves the 1976 Cincinnati Reds' record of five starting players intact. The remaining five Dodgers finalists were outvoted, and their potential selection as reserves now depends on votes from MLB players and the commissioner’s office.

          <p>President Trump's extensive budget bill faces significant opposition in the US House of Representatives, jeopardizing its passage before the July 4 deadline. Despite narrowly clearing the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson is struggling to gather enough Republican votes. Key sticking points include the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit, which fiscal conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus strongly oppose, and substantial cuts to Medicaid and other social programs. These cuts are particularly contentious, as they are estimated to strip health insurance from nearly 12 million Americans by 2034. President Trump is actively lobbying holdouts to secure this defining piece of his second-term agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson, Sean Parnell, announced that US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities last month are estimated to have set back Iran's program by "one to two years." This assessment offers a more measured view than President Trump's assertion of "obliteration" and an earlier Defense Intelligence Agency report that suggested only a "several months" delay. Evolving intelligence, including video from B-2 bombers confirming centrifuge destruction, underpins this updated estimate. The full extent of the damage remains critical, particularly as Iran has now suspended cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, complicating independent verification of its nuclear activities.</p>

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a bill halting cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), citing security concerns for its facilities and scientists. This move, labeled "unacceptable" by the U.S. State Department, raises fears of Iran potentially withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty (NPT), which would signal a serious intent to develop nuclear arms.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminal justice doctoral student charged with the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. This plea deal, which spares him the death penalty, ensures he faces up to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Kohberger admitted to the killings of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves, ending a case that had garnered national attention. While some victims' families expressed relief at avoiding a prolonged trial, others voiced fury over the state's decision not to pursue capital punishment.</p>

However, no public ceremony is planned, and their identities are being protected for security reasons due to the sensitive nature of their mission.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, establishing a 20% tariff on imports, a notable reduction from the initially threatened 46% levy. In exchange, Vietnam will grant the United States "TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade" with zero tariffs on American products. The agreement also imposes a steeper 40% tariff on goods identified as "trans-shipping," addressing concerns about Chinese products being rerouted through Vietnam. This deal, a result of Trump's "reciprocal" tariff strategy, is expected to benefit companies that had relocated manufacturing to Vietnam to circumvent earlier China tariffs. The Trump Organization also has development projects in Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is conducting a comprehensive review of weapons deliveries to global allies due to concerns over dwindling stockpiles of crucial munitions, particularly anti-air missiles. This assessment follows the White House's decision to limit weapon shipments to Ukraine, aiming to prioritize America's defense interests after a Department of Defense review. The high expenditure of US interceptor air defense missiles during last month's conflict with Iran and in Qatar is a contributing factor. Defense spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed the military's readiness but underscored the necessity of re-evaluating munitions distribution, a strategy influenced by the "prioritisers" faction focusing on the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <h2>Planned Parenthood Warns Budget Bill Could Slash Abortion Access in Blue States</h2>

          <p>Planned Parenthood's CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that the Republican-backed budget bill could cut approximately $700 million in federal funding, potentially forcing the closure of nearly 200 health centers. This provision, imposing a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits that offer abortions and receive substantial federal funding, is widely seen as a "backdoor abortion ban." The cuts would disproportionately affect clinics in blue states where abortion remains protected, potentially leaving over 1.1 million patients without access to essential care, as community health centers lack the capacity to absorb such a large patient influx.

          <h2>New Housing Trend Challenges Conventional Wisdom as Sun Belt Prices Soar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 18:10:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Conventional housing wisdom, which once pointed to Sun Belt cities as affordable alternatives to expensive coastal hubs, is now being challenged as prices in places like Phoenix and Miami have surged over 130% in the past decade. This article, drawing on Rogé Karma's research, suggests that Sun Belt cities are encountering similar housing development slowdowns experienced by coastal areas two decades ago. The core issues are restrictive zoning laws and increasing NIMBYism, where existing homeowners resist new development due to economic concerns or aesthetic preferences. The piece argues that significant policy changes are crucial to counter the influence of small groups impeding housing growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi boxing power broker Turki Alalshikh has hinted that former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury could emerge from retirement to fight in 2026. Fury, 36, had announced his retirement in January following his rematch loss to Oleksandr Usyk. Alalshikh posted on X, stating he had Fury's commitment for a return during the Riyadh season, a sentiment echoed by Fury on Instagram. However, Fury also expressed a strong preference for a revenge fight against Usyk in England, or a major British clash with Anthony Joshua, indicating his potential return would be on his terms.</p>
