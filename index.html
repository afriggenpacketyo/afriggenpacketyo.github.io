          <h2>Spain Faces Renewed Anti-Tourism Protests Amidst Overtourism Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 04:43:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spain is bracing for a resurgence of anti-tourism protests as residents express growing frustration over overcrowded city centers and housing shortages exacerbated by the influx of tourists. Activists are planning large-scale demonstrations across major cities and islands, including Barcelona, Valencia, and Mallorca, to voice their concerns about the negative impact of mass tourism on local quality of life. The protesters aim to challenge what they perceive as a "tourism-first culture" that prioritizes the industry's interests over the well-being of residents, citing issues like rising rents and the displacement of locals. Despite government efforts to regulate vacation rentals, the country anticipates record tourist numbers, intensifying the debate over sustainable tourism practices, and the demonstrations hope to ignite real change. The optimism score is calculated by weighing the severity of the protests with the potential for positive policy changes. The score is 45.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally condemned Iran for failing to meet its non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such censure in nearly two decades.

          <p>The struggling UK bargain chain Poundland has been sold for a nominal Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers, prompting a proposed restructure that could involve store closures.

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda broadcasts along the border with North Korea, marking a significant step towards easing tensions between the two countries. The move, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, is part of efforts to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea had resumed the broadcasts in June last year in retaliation for North Korea's trash-laden balloon campaign. The decision reflects the new government's commitment to improving relations with Pyongyang. The score is 70.</p>
