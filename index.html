Klein's book, "Abundance," has sparked debate, with some arguing that Democrats should prioritize breaking up corporate power rather than focusing on increasing the supply of housing, energy, and infrastructure. A poll commissioned by a leftist advocacy group showed that voters are more concerned about corporate power than bottlenecks hindering production. The discussion reflects a broader struggle within the party to define its priorities and messaging following recent political setbacks.</p>

          <p>A covert operation by Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, which involved detonating explosive pagers among Hezbollah militants, significantly weakened the Iranian-backed terrorist group. This attack, along with the subsequent assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, led to a ceasefire and a diminished Iranian influence in the region. The events have also contributed to the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, cutting off Hezbollah's access to a critical military position and training ground. The shift marks a failure of Iran's proxy war strategy and a potential reinvention for Hezbollah as a political organization in Lebanon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is contemplating a significant overhaul of its electricity market, moving from a national system to regional markets, to address rising energy costs. Currently, energy firms receive compensation for curtailing output when the grid lacks capacity, while gas-fired plants are paid to increase electricity supply, adding to consumer bills. The proposed "zonal" pricing aims to leverage renewable energy resources in areas like Scotland, potentially lowering prices for local customers. However, the plan faces opposition from energy companies and concerns about potential cost increases for consumers in other regions.</p>
