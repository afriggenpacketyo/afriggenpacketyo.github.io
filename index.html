          <p>A White House official informed CNBC that President Trump might implement new tariffs on imported vehicles as early as Wednesday.  However, the exact timing remains uncertain, with the possibility of the announcement being delayed until later in the week.  This follows Trump's earlier suggestion that the tariffs could be announced before April 2nd.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that upcoming April tariffs might be less stringent than initially proposed, citing potential hardship for businesses.  The White House later clarified that non-tariff barriers will no longer be considered in determining reciprocal tariff rates.
