          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stated she hopes President Trump will not dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, emphasizing her respect for Powell's dedication to his mandate. Lagarde avoided commenting on the potential market implications of such an event, expressing her belief that it is "not on the table." Trump has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, while Powell has cautioned that Trump's trade policies could hinder economic growth and raise inflation. Lagarde noted that both she and Powell are accustomed to political pressure.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its global growth forecast, predicting that the U.S. economy will be particularly hard-hit by President Trump's tariffs. The IMF now projects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, a decrease from the 3.3% forecast in January. The U.S. economy is expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, down from the previous forecast of 2.7%.

          <p>Major U.S. ports, particularly Los Angeles and Long Beach, are experiencing a significant drop in freight vessel traffic from China, signaling a pullback in trade due to President Trump's tariffs and recession fears. For the week ending May 3, freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports are down 29% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year. This slowdown is impacting ground transport, with a sharp decrease in available truck loads. These figures highlight the tangible effects of trade tensions on the shipping industry and related sectors.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing of a tour company owner, a court heard that a paddleboarder was "guided to her death" following the deaths of four people on the River Cleddau in 2021. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, owner of Salty Dog, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley drowned in hazardous conditions. The court heard that Lloyd did not have the proper qualifications and that safety concerns were raised before the tour, which proceeded despite the dangerous river conditions. Family members of the deceased delivered emotional statements in court, detailing the devastating impact of their loss and accusing Lloyd of negligence and a lack of remorse.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts sluggish U.S. economic growth in 2025, citing an escalating trade war and high policy uncertainty. The U.S. economy is projected to grow by 1.8% this year, a 0.9% decrease from January's forecast and a full percentage point lower than last year's projection. The IMF also noted an increased probability of a U.S. recession, rising from 25% to 37%. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policy is driving the IMF's projection, with tariffs already impacting small businesses and various industries.</p>

While the golf course itself is highly regarded, concerns about road, rail, and accommodation infrastructure remain.
