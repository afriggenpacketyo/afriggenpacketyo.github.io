            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned that financial markets would experience a significant downturn if President Trump were to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Warren, a frequent critic of Powell, acknowledged her disagreements with him on regulations and interest rates. However, she emphasized the critical importance of the Fed's independence, asserting that presidential interference would destabilize the U.S. economy. This warning follows Trump's recent complaints about Powell and the Fed's monetary policy, raising concerns about potential political influence over the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating his 'termination cannot come soon enough' and urging the central bank to lower interest rates. This sentiment echoes Trump's previous criticisms of Powell, despite the Fed's longstanding norm of political independence. Powell recently voiced concerns about Trump's tariff policy, predicting it would likely increase inflation and slow economic growth. Trump's remarks highlight the ongoing tension between the White House and the Fed regarding monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has stated it will take action against the NHS if it fails to update its guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex. The EHRC is developing an updated code of conduct for public services, including the NHS and prisons, in response to the ruling. This ruling could impact spaces such as hospital wards and changing rooms, as it clarifies that a person born male, even with a Gender Recognition Certificate, does not have an automatic right to use women-only spaces. The NHS says it is reviewing its guidance and will consider relevant legislation and the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop after the company lowered its annual profit forecast, citing higher-than-expected medical costs within its Medicare Advantage plans. This development has raised concerns among Wall Street analysts about the potential impact on other health insurers offering similar plans. The company's first-quarter results indicated accelerating medical costs, particularly in doctor and outpatient services, surpassing previous expectations. Analysts suggest that this issue may disproportionately affect companies that have expanded their market share in Medicare Advantage, while those that have scaled back may be less impacted.

Officials, however, disregarded these warnings, failing to adequately plan for or acknowledge the harms of closures.

            <p>The UK's largest teaching union, the NEU, is threatening to campaign against Labour MPs if the government does not offer teachers in England a fully funded, above-inflation pay rise. NEU General Secretary Daniel Kebede stated that members expect better from a Labour government and are prepared to strike if their demands are not met. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged the NEU to put children first, but Kebede accused the government of betraying education funding. The NEU has agreed to hold a formal ballot on strike action if the pay offer remains unacceptable or if no extra funding is announced.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of gender in equality law is being described as providing clarity after years of ambiguity. The ruling states that the term 'woman' refers to a biological woman, excluding biological men who have transitioned to being female. This decision has implications for public bodies, including the NHS and prisons, which are now reviewing their policies. While the Equality Act still protects transgender people from harassment and discrimination, the ruling is expected to lead to changes in access to single-sex spaces and participation in sports.</p>

            <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow you to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD and are generally safe investments with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Strategies for getting a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs by buying some one year, some two years, some three years, etc. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government has temporarily banned individuals from bringing cheese and certain meats from the European Union (EU) into the country in an effort to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The ban applies to pork, beef, lamb, and dairy products, but excludes chicken, duck, and goose. It affects travelers arriving in Great Britain from the EU by any mode of transport, but does not apply to Northern Ireland or commercial importers.

The mishap was laughed off by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who revealed that she too had briefly been a member of the chat along with senior journalists, former cabinet members and other Tory MPs. A source said the ICO did not need to be involved because the contacts had been added to the group for 'personal purposes' and the risk of malicious use was low.</p>

            <p>Turkey's central bank surprised markets by raising its key interest rate from 42.5% to 46%, ending the easing cycle it began last year. This decision comes amid economic disruption due to U.S. tariffs and political upheaval following the arrest of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The Monetary Policy Committee cited the potential effects of rising global protectionism on the disinflation process and stated that the tight monetary stance will be maintained until price stability is achieved. The rate hike follows significant foreign currency depletion as the central bank defended the lira.</p>

            <p>New research indicates that a significant number of toothpaste brands are contaminated with lead and other heavy metals, including arsenic, mercury, and cadmium. Testing of 51 toothpaste brands, including those marketed for children and as 'green' products, revealed that about 90% contained lead. The levels of these toxins in some brands exceeded certain federal and state limits, although the FDA's current lead limit for children is 10,000 ppb, and 20,000 ppb for adults. The contamination appears to originate from ingredients such as hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate, and bentonite clay.</p>
