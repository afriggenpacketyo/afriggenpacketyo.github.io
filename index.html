          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv to pledge intensified pressure on Russia for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, following a phone call with President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky. Ukraine and its allies are prepared for a full ceasefire on land, air, and sea for at least 30 days starting Monday, but Russia remains opposed to any ceasefire unless Western nations stop providing military aid to Ukraine. The European leaders laid flowers at a memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and discussed ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military to ensure any future peace deal proves enduring. The coming weeks will test whether European resolve and resources can match the scale of the challenge as the war's outcome increasingly becomes Europe's problem to solve.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending tensions that had escalated following an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. President Trump announced the ceasefire on social media, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the US mediated the agreement. The ceasefire comes after days of cross-border fire and strikes, with civilian casualties reported on both sides, and rising tensions following an April attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir. India had previously accused Pakistan of attacking 26 locations across India, while Pakistan denied involvement in the April attack and said it was conducting retaliatory strikes.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 for a Venus mission but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, reentered the Earth's atmosphere. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, while the European Space Agency's space debris office indicated the spacecraft reentered after it failed to appear over a German radar station. The spacecraft, weighing half a ton, was built to withstand a landing on Venus, leading experts to believe some parts might have survived the descent. The chances of anyone getting hit by debris were exceedingly low, according to scientists.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died and major roads were cut off after heavy rains led to flooding in Mogadishu, Somalia, due to an overwhelmed drainage system and a growing urban population. The regional administration spokesperson reported that rescue efforts were ongoing, with concerns the death toll could rise due to collapsed houses and severe road damage. The rains lasted for about eight hours, leaving waist-high waters in neighborhoods, trapping residents and forcing others to move to higher ground. Floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, halting public transport and temporarily disrupting operations at the main airport.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, citing that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with a group of unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs known as ‚Äúreductions in force‚Äù for 14 days. The ruling is the broadest against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk, with dozens of lawsuits challenging the work of the ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge). The judge scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>

          <p>Recent equipment failures at an air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, responsible for guiding planes to and from Newark Liberty International Airport, have exposed years of strain due to staffing shortages and underinvestment. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace dated radar and communications systems across U.S. airspace, requiring congressional approval of over $30 billion in funding. The FAA plans to beef up staffing at the Philadelphia facility and install a temporary backup system. The urgency to fix lingering problems reached a new level after a Black Hawk Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines regional jet on Jan. 29, killing all 67 people on board the aircraft.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war, resulting in missile and drone strikes. After U.S.-led mediation talks, the countries agreed to a ceasefire. The rivalry between the two countries stems from the partition of India in 1947 and the dispute over the Kashmir region. Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it. The conflict has led to multiple wars and a pro-independence insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him "Too Late," as the Fed navigates a volatile policy mix with tariffs threatening both growth and inflation. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation, facing threats to both sides of the Fed's mandate, and his decision to hold steady on interest rates may ultimately be seen as a mistake. Trump has been urging the central bank to cut rates, insisting that inflation has been slayed, but recent economic data do not indicate price spikes nor a perceptible slowdown in economic activity. Powell has dismissed any idea of a pre-emptive rate cut, despite sentiment survey data indicating worries in the manufacturing and service sectors, and consumer sentiment souring.</p>

          <p>The article argues that progressives should be concerned about the rapidly falling rates of family formation in the US and the rest of the world. An aging and shrinking population means a massive decrease in expected quality of life in the future, with fewer people to support a larger elderly population and fewer people to do the things that make life richer and more interesting. The author suggests that progressive policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could help address the issue.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that a spear tip carved from bone, unearthed from Russia in 2003, is as old as 80,000 years, meaning it could not have been created by modern humans. Homo sapiens didn't venture into Europe until about 45,000 years ago, so the most likely spear-wielders in this case were the Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis). The spear tip joins a few other recent finds that demonstrate Neanderthals developed techniques specific to working with bone, such as scraping and flat cutting.

          <p>President Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is threatening his ability to pass crypto legislation, as lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act due to concerns about conflicts of interest. The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, have raised concerns about self-dealing and financial conflicts of interest. Democrats are calling for investigations into Trump-linked coins and demanding financial records from World Liberty Financial, potentially impacting hopes for other legislative achievements and deregulation efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores how part-time jobs have become a trap for low-wage workers in America. Employers are increasingly hiring multiple part-time staff in place of one full-time worker, subjecting them to inconsistent schedules and fluctuating hours. The article argues that this shift circumvents the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets a ceiling on work but not a floor, and results in underwork for millions of Americans. The author suggests reforms such as requiring large employers to set schedules in advance and allowing hourly workers to choose whether they want to work part- or full-time.</p>

The company's autonomous counter-drone systems are made to detect classify, and track uncrewed aerial systems and then decide on the best firing solution for taking them out. The system is invulnerable to signal jamming and other elements of electronic warfare because it relies on visual navigation and autonomous terminal guidance. The company's Core Targeting Module, or CTM, is at the heart of AimLock's systems, combining autonomy and firing and targeting components to improve the speed and precision of weapons from guns to uncrewed systems.</p>
