          <p>Renowned chef Roy Choi, known for his Korean-Mexican fusion food truck Kogi, is promoting a more vegetable-forward cooking style in his latest cookbook, "The Choi of Cooking." He suggests three key strategies to make vegetables more appealing: prepping produce in advance like restaurants do, creating flavorful homemade sauces to enhance dishes, and using MSG to add a savory umami flavor. Choi emphasizes that these methods can make healthy eating more convenient and delicious, helping people move away from processed foods. The article provides recipes for three of his signature sauces to help home cooks get started.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to President Michael D Higgins. The main contenders are independent candidate Catherine Connolly, backed by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. Early tallies from Dublin count centers show strong initial support for Connolly, though turnout is projected to be low. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot despite withdrawing from the race, leading to a notable number of spoiled votes. The final result is expected to be announced later today at Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham is preparing for a high-stakes El Clasico against Barcelona, a match that serves as a critical platform for him to reassert his form. After a difficult start to the season due to injury and being left out of the recent England squad, the midfielder aims to make a statement. This match is notable for being the first El Clasico to potentially feature two English players, with Barcelona's Marcus Rashford also in form. For Bellingham, the globally televised fixture is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities to both his club's fans and England manager Thomas Tuchel.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations are taking place across Germany in response to controversial comments made by Chancellor Friedrich Merz regarding urban migration. Critics, including members of his own coalition, have condemned his remarks as divisive, while a recent survey indicates a majority of the public agrees with his statements. Merz clarified his comments were aimed at migrants without legal residence who do not comply with German laws. Meanwhile, government figures show a significant increase in deportations in 2025 compared to the previous year, a development that has drawn criticism from some opposition politicians over human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has rejected an offer from President Trump to resume negotiations on the country's nuclear program, framing any potential agreement under current conditions as coercion. This follows a recent 12-day conflict where US and Israeli forces attacked Iranian nuclear facilities. In response to the reinstatement of all UN sanctions, Iran has ceased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), heightening the risk of further conflict. Analysts suggest Iran's leadership is in a dilemma, attempting to project strength while avoiding actions that could provoke a major military strike from the US or Israel.</p>

          <p>Social media claims that Germany has canceled its Christmas markets for 2025 are false, according to a fact-check investigation. While a few small, local markets have been called off for reasons like renovations or low vendor interest, the vast majority of Germany's over 2,500 iconic markets are scheduled to proceed as planned. The viral claims appear to originate from a single, questionable article that misrepresented information and used sensationalist language. Although security costs for markets have risen since past terror attacks, this has not led to the widespread closures being falsely reported online.</p>

          <p>As winter approaches and daylight hours decrease, experts are highlighting methods to cope with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression that affects over a million people in the UK. In Scotland's northern isles, where winter daylight can be as short as six hours, a new 'Wintering Well' initiative is providing therapeutic lamps through libraries. The project, led by the University of Glasgow, also offers tools and guides to encourage building new 'light routines' and adopting a more positive psychological mindset towards winter. This includes spending time outdoors and creating cozy, well-lit indoor environments to improve mental health.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' commanding 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series has raised questions about whether a week-long break disrupted their momentum. After sweeping the NLCS, the Dodgers appeared out of sync, with starting pitcher Blake Snell and reliever Emmet Sheehan both struggling significantly. Historically, teams that sweep their league championship series have a poor record in the World Series against opponents who played a full seven-game series. While the team officially denies that the layoff was a factor, the performance suggests the extended rest may have made their pitchers "too fresh," affecting their control and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, will focus on resolving key regional conflicts, including the long-standing border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a formal peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, following a ceasefire brokered earlier this year. However, diplomatic efforts regarding Myanmar have been largely ineffective, as the bloc struggles to implement its five-point peace plan. The summit will also mark a milestone with the official admission of Timor-Leste as ASEAN's 11th member state.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several former and current Justice Department officials, including special counsel Jack Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland. Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, codenamed Arctic Frost, that reportedly obtained the phone records of nine Republican lawmakers following the 2020 election. This marks the latest instance of the president demanding legal action against his political adversaries. The FBI probe examined communications surrounding efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, which was the subject of a criminal case against Trump that was later abandoned.</p>

          <p>Facing a shrinking and aging population, Russia is implementing restrictive laws aimed at boosting its birth rate by promoting "traditional family values." For decades, President Vladimir Putin has identified demographic decline as a major national challenge, which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and an exodus of young people. The government has introduced laws banning the promotion of abortion and "child-free ideology" while outlawing LGBTQ+ activism. Critics argue these measures are repressive and ineffective, asserting that they will only lead to illegal abortions and will not address the underlying economic uncertainty that discourages people from having children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has sanctioned five subsidiaries of the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group, a major player in the global shipbuilding industry. The ministry accused Hanwha of assisting a U.S. investigation into Chinese competitors that resulted in new port fees. The sanctions prohibit the Hanwha entities from engaging in any transactions or cooperation with Chinese individuals or companies. This move comes as Hanwha deepens its ties with the U.S., particularly through its acquisition of the Philly Shipyard, which is central to a U.S.-South Korea initiative to revitalize the American shipbuilding industry.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the private donors funding President Trump's new $300 million White House ballroom reveals that many are corporations and executives with significant interests in federal policy and regulation. The list of contributors includes major tech companies like Google and Microsoft, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, and crypto firms such as Coinbase and Ripple. Many of these entities are seeking favorable policy decisions, government contracts, or approval for major business deals from the Trump administration. The White House has dismissed conflict-of-interest concerns, stating the private funding model is preferable to using taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' stunning 11-4 defeat to the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series opener has shattered the team's aura of invincibility. The Blue Jays' offense dismantled the Dodgers' pitching, particularly targeting the bullpen after wearing down ace Blake Snell. A disastrous nine-run sixth inning for the Dodgers highlighted the bullpen's weakness, a potential liability that had been masked by strong starting pitching throughout the playoffs. The decisive loss raises serious doubts about the Dodgers' championship prospects and suggests the series will be far more competitive than anticipated, challenging the narrative of an inevitable Dodgers victory.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries stated his support was based on Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement from the powerful Brooklyn Democrat consolidates support for Mamdani within the party. This comes as Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, recently secured the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, with Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic in its path. The National Hurricane Center has issued a hurricane warning for Jamaica, warning of potentially "life-threatening and catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides early next week. The storm is predicted to bring extreme rainfall, with some areas possibly receiving up to three feet of rain, and could pack winds of 140 mph. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland U.S., it poses a severe threat to the Caribbean islands.</p>
