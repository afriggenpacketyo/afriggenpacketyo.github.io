          <p>A Chinese research team from the PLA Air Force Early Warning Academy in Wuhan has assessed the B-52 Stratofortress bomber as the top threat to China in a potential tactical nuclear air strike, surpassing even the F-35 and B-2 bombers. The study simulated a US Air Force penetrating counterair operation on Chinese naval fleets or inland targets, focusing on the B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs carried by these platforms. The researchers emphasized that these nuclear-armed platforms amplify destructive power through blast waves, radiation, and radioactive contamination, posing a significant risk to core anti-access/area denial facilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' urging them to overcome their reservations and support the legislation, which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing military and immigration enforcement spending, and cutting Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. Despite Trump's pressure, many Republicans remained unconvinced, seeking further changes before committing their support. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated with various factions to address their concerns, aiming to secure enough votes for the bill's passage, but faced challenges in balancing the demands of conservatives and moderate Republicans.</p>

          <p>Target has revised its sales outlook for the year, citing weak discretionary spending, tariff uncertainty, and negative reactions to the company's reduction of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. First-quarter sales fell nearly 3% year-over-year, missing Wall Street's expectations, with fewer transactions and decreased average customer spending. CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged that Target is losing market share in key merchandise categories and announced leadership changes, including the creation of an Enterprise Acceleration Office to streamline operations and boost growth.

          <p>House Republicans are currently negotiating the final details of the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,' which contains several key campaign promises made by President Trump. The bill could potentially lead to over 8 million people losing Medicaid coverage and would cut SNAP food assistance by roughly $230 billion over 10 years. It also extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime pay, provides $50 billion for border wall construction, and commits roughly $150 billion in defense spending. The Congressional Budget Office continues to review the legislation, and the Senate is expected to make significant changes.</p>

San Francisco has the highest prices, averaging $13.88 per meal, while Columbus, Ohio, is the most affordable at $10.01. FinanceBuzz found that average fast-food prices have increased significantly over the past decade, with some items doubling in cost. The rising prices are impacting lower-income workers, who spend a considerable portion of their wages on fast food, and McDonald's has reported a drop in sales due to economic anxieties and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers have set a new record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, used xenon to pre-acclimatize to low oxygen at high altitudes, enabling a faster ascent compared to the typical six to eight weeks. While the use of xenon remains disputed within the mountaineering community, organizers claim it facilitated the rapid climb, as the team slept for six weeks in special tents before traveling to Nepal.

Economists now believe that this inflation figure makes it more likely that there will be only one interest rate cut this year, as opposed to the two that were previously expected.

          <p>Donald Trump's recent Middle East trip has been remarkably successful due to his focus on American business interests and his willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns. By bringing American industry leaders to meetings and promising no more nation-building projects, Trump has positioned the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner. He has also made decisions, such as announcing a cease-fire with the Houthis and negotiating with Iran, that other presidents would have found politically difficult. However, to maintain this success, Trump needs to balance business interests with other priorities and ensure the U.S. remains an attractive investment destination.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber targeted a bus carrying school children in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, resulting in the deaths of at least four children and two adults. The attack occurred in the Khuzdar district, with the bus en route to a military-run school carrying around 40 students. Pakistani authorities have launched an investigation, with initial probes suggesting it was a suicide bombing. The Pakistani military and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have blamed India for the attack, though no evidence has been provided to support this claim.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody and control of any migrants deported to South Sudan, amid concerns that the administration violated an earlier order. The order prevents deportations of migrants to countries other than their own without sufficient opportunity to contest their removal. The judge's action follows an emergency motion from attorneys alleging that at least 12 migrants had been sent to South Sudan, including one from Myanmar and another from Vietnam. The Justice Department has provided conflicting information regarding the deportations, leading to further scrutiny from the court.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that people should not be able to camp without permission. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. This decision is expected to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where there is no general right to wild camp on most private land.</p>

The book's influence helps explain why conservatives have been comfortable with Trump's lawless gutting of the federal government, seeing it as a rescue of the Constitution from liberalism.</p>
