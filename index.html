          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to softer-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely the company will reach break-even operating margins this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline will cut off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, and pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets. The carrier is also reassessing hiring plans and potentially combining leadership roles while reducing travel spending. These steps are necessary as the company relies on borrowed cash to maintain operations amid a slower-than-anticipated return to profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump warned Iranian leader Ali Khamenei that he is an "easy target" and demanded Tehran surrender in its conflict against Israel. Trump stated that the U.S. knows the location of the Supreme Leader but will not target him for now, emphasizing that missiles should not be aimed at civilians or American soldiers. He expressed dwindling patience and called for Iran's unconditional surrender. This threat follows reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate the ayatollah, a claim downplayed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that calling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz after a political assassination would be a "waste of time," criticizing Walz as "whacked out" and "grossly incompetent." This comes after a masked gunman killed Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife. Walz's team responded by stating that the tragedy is not about Trump or Walz, but about the families and the State of Minnesota, and that the governor remains focused on helping them heal.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whom he views as an existential threat to Israel. Netanyahu urged the Iranian people to stand up against the oppressive regime, while President Trump stated that the U.S. knows Khamenei's location but will not target him for now. Israel's strikes have killed several top Iranian generals and security advisors, but experts note that Iran's clerical regime has a system in place to maintain stability. Despite potential regime collapse, there is no guarantee that a new government would be friendlier to Israel or the U.S.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to hold a national inquiry into grooming gangs after previously accusing those calling for one of jumping on a far-right bandwagon. The decision follows a report by Baroness Casey, who initially believed local inquiries would suffice but changed her mind due to a lack of volunteer councils and reluctance from some organizations to cooperate. The report recommends a national police operation to review unacted cases and a national inquiry overseen by an Independent Commission. Starmer emphasized the inquiry must address all relevant factors, including ethnicity and the role of public officials.</p>

          <p>Mothers in the U.S. are bearing the brunt of rising costs, juggling household responsibilities and full-time jobs amidst concerns about food and childcare expenses. Trade tariffs are estimated to cost the average American household roughly $2,500 this year, disproportionately affecting clothing and textiles. Mothers also face the persistent gender pay gap, earning roughly 74 cents for every dollar paid to working fathers, with the disparity being worse for mothers of color. Policies such as paid family leave, flexible work schedules, and affordable childcare could help mothers achieve a more equitable work-life balance.</p>

          <p>After five years under General Assimi Goita's military rule, Mali continues to grapple with security and political challenges. Despite the initial promise of improved security, jihadist attacks have increased and expanded beyond the north and center of the country.

          <p>With credit card debt ballooning, it's crucial to know how to manage delinquent payments to minimize the damage. Being 30 days late can trigger late fees, but acting quickly can protect your credit score. At 60 days late, credit scores can drop sharply, and penalty APRs may apply. By 90 days, the account may be escalated to collections. Contacting creditors, exploring hardship programs, and aggressively tracking your budget are essential steps to regain control.
