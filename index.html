          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss economic and trade issues, marking a potential step toward resolving the ongoing trade war initiated by President Trump. The meetings will also include discussions with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, as the U.S. aims to rebalance the international economic system to better serve American interests. This move has already positively impacted stock futures, which rose sharply following the announcement of the upcoming negotiations, suggesting market optimism about potential de-escalation in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>India reported conducting strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, responding to a militant attack that killed over two dozen civilians in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian government asserts the strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure and were designed to be non-escalatory, while Pakistan denounced the actions as an unprovoked act of war and promised a response. President Trump described the situation as 'a shame' and expressed hope for a swift resolution, with the UN calling for restraint between the two nuclear-armed countries. These strikes represent a significant escalation in the long-standing conflict between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has formally revoked some layoff notices, restoring staff at the CDC and FDA, including the World Trade Center Health Program which serves 9/11 first responders. This reversal follows criticism from lawmakers regarding cuts to the 9/11 program and other critical health initiatives, with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stating the programs are being consolidated into a new agency. However, not all promised job restorations have been realized, as some FDA labs and the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health are still affected, while additional layoffs at the NIH have further complicated the situation.</p>

          <p>Montana Governor Greg Gianforte vetoed House Bill 477, which aimed to phase out Styrofoam containers by 2030, arguing it constitutes government overreach and would disproportionately affect the hospitality industry. Gianforte criticized the bill for singling out restaurants and food establishments while ignoring other industries that use Styrofoam, and raised concerns about the estimated $300,000 cost to taxpayers for a new DEQ program. Proponents of the bill had argued that Styrofoam poses health and environmental risks, but the governor maintained that the state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that topped expectations, but will take a $1.5 billion hit to revenue from chip restrictions to China. AMD CEO Lisa Su said that the company achieved its first-quarter results despite grappling with regulations on advanced AI chip exports. The company's forecast included $800 million in costs that the company said it would incur because the U.S. limited the export of some of the company's artificial intelligence chips during the quarter.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep more film productions in the U.S., following President Trump's call for tariffs on films produced overseas. While Hollywood insiders support the proposal, it faces significant obstacles, including the challenge of convincing taxpayers to support an industry viewed as wealthy and politically liberal. The proposal aims to support the entertainment industry, which has been affected by the pandemic, strikes, and spending cuts, but its political optics are considered very difficult.</p>

Despite the tensions, both leaders sought to play it cool, but the meeting highlighted the potential effects of the trade war that Trump has unleashed around the world.</p>

The lower prices benefit consumers through cheaper gasoline and goods, but negatively impact oil producers who may cut spending and hiring.</p>
