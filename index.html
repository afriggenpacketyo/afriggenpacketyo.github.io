          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two deaths and at least 19 injuries according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The incident occurred as the ship was passing under the bridge, causing damage to its masts and leading to a large emergency response. Preliminary investigations suggest mechanical issues and a power cut may have contributed to the collision, prompting the National Transportation Safety Board to launch a full investigation. The New York Times article further reports that the ship was on a goodwill tour, en route to Iceland, with 277 people on board, and that the Brooklyn Bridge sustained no major structural damage. The article also notes that the Cuauhtémoc's masts were roughly 160 feet tall, while the bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging Chicago into near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds up to 70 mph lifting dust from parched farmland. According to the New York Times article, this event marks the first time the Weather Service has issued a dust storm warning for Chicago itself, with the last comparable event occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The article notes that dry soil conditions, with moisture levels at a record low of 2-5%, contributed to the storm's intensity.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for healthcare, particularly those with disabilities and low incomes. ABC News reports that an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans claim the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting coverage, individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, fear losing access to essential services and medications. The article also discusses concerns about proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which could jeopardize care for those struggling with substance use disorder.</p>

The article notes that while the U.S. maintains its historic ties with Israel, Trump's focus has shifted towards engaging with Gulf States and pursuing deals that may conflict with Netanyahu's preferences.</p>

While the number of women in the armed forces has increased, they remain underutilized and marginalized due to deeply rooted stereotypes among male commanders.

          <p>Chinese researchers say they have developed a “groundbreaking” fibre-optic gyroscope that is stable across a large temperature range and can be used for navigation. According to the team from the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, the gyroscope could offer a more stable way to measure navigation for aircraft, ships and oil rigs. Those navigation systems allow for the measurement of vehicles without the need for external signals like satellites. That makes them immune to interference, which is vital for military and security applications.</p>

          <p>When tickets for comedian Jimmy O. Yang’s June shows in Hong Kong sold out within seconds, fans flooded social media to lament how tough it was to get a seat. While some scrambled for resale tickets – complete with heavy mark-up – others outside the city found it easier to buy travel packages that included airport transfers and guaranteed bookings. Similarly, when British rock band Coldplay performed at Kai Tak Stadium in April, many travelling fans secured their spots by purchasing bundles with concert tickets and hotel stays. With domestic consumption high on Beijing’s economic agenda this year as trade tensions make export growth less reliable, local governments are bundling spots at popular shows with discounted hotel, dining and tourist bookings to encourage people to buy more than a ticket.</p>

          <p>The White House released a video of President Donald Trump speaking with American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander after he was released earlier this week after being held captive by Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. In the video, Edan sits next to Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump's voice is heard on a speakerphone. Trump appeared fascinated in learning more about what Alexander had endured under captivity. President Trump noted how Alexander's family became strong advocates for their son's release and regularly communicated with the president. 'You’re an American, and we love you, and we’re going to take good care of you. And your parents are incredible. I saw your mother. She was pushing me around a little bit. She was putting a lot of pressure on me,' Trump closed.</p>

As investigators tried to piece together what unfolded, they found a rare clue in the bedroom: bloody, bare footprints. Investigators knew the footprints had to belong to Childs' killer because she was wearing socks at the time of her death.

          <p>President Trump scolded Walmart on Saturday after the retail giant warned that his tariffs would force it to raise prices, writing on social media that the discount chain could afford to absorb the costs of the new import taxes without passing them on to customers. Mr. Trump’s attempt to bully Walmart into keeping its prices steady came as the president, who campaigned on a pledge to prevent inflation, is working to keep his tumultuous trade policy from driving up prices. Walmart, which sells a broad selection of affordable goods to millions of Americans, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump’s tariffs, even at their recently reduced levels, would soon force it to start raising prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for warning that his tariffs would lead to price increases, asserting that the retail giant should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. According to the New York Times article, Trump's remarks came after Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, stated that the company would do its best to keep prices low but would not be able to absorb all the pressure imposed by the tariffs. The article notes that Walmart sources a significant portion of its products from abroad, particularly China and Mexico, making it susceptible to tariff-related cost increases.</p>

          <p>Minnesota crime scene investigators captured footage when they got their first look inside a high-rise apartment in Minneapolis. According to police reports, at around 5:30 p.m. on June 13, 1993, a tenant reported water seeping into their apartment. A building caretaker and a security guard were called to check it out, and discovered the water was coming from apartment 2104. After the shower was turned off, they came upon a gruesome scene in the bedroom. The body of 35-year-old Jeanie Childs was discovered partially under the bed. That's when police were called to investigate. This was a violent, bloody crime scene … this is … one of the bloodiest that I'd been to.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering plans to have convicted criminals fill potholes and clean bins as part of their community service. BBC News reports that Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The money earned from this labor would be allocated to a fund for victim support groups. The move comes amid prison overcrowding issues, with the goal of making punishment more meaningful and beneficial to society.</p>

          <p>Despite a threat from Donald Trump to shut his mouth — or else, Bruce Springsteen stood his ground, unleashing another blistering critique of the president and his administration during a concert in Manchester, England, on Saturday night. The New Jersey rocker echoed many of the same sentiments delivered during the kick-off of The E Street Band’s “Land of Hope and Dreams Tour” earlier this week. “In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Springsteen proclaimed. “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring!”</p>

          <p>The call came late Friday to the Rev. Derrick Perkins: Three people were trapped in the Centennial Christian Church in St. Louis after a tornado had toppled part of its steeple, leaving it in dusty piles of bricks and stones. A signal from one person’s cellphone helped Pastor Perkins and emergency workers find those trapped inside. But one of the people, a beloved longtime ministry leader, was killed, Pastor Perkins said. “I was in disbelief — heartbroken,” he said, holding back tears. “Not only for the church, but for the entire community.”</p>
