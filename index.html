          <p>Paramount Global has settled a lawsuit with President Trump for $16 million concerning a "60 Minutes" interview, a move seen as clearing a path for the company's sale to Skydance Media. The settlement money will be directed to Trump's future presidential library, with no funds going directly to him, and includes his attorneys' fees. While Paramount did not issue an apology, it agreed to release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates. The settlement ends a contentious legal battle that Trump claimed caused him "mental anguish" over edits to an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng announced its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, with 34,611 vehicles delivered in June. This performance stands out amid a fierce price war in China's EV market that has challenged competitors like Nio, Li Auto, and Zeekr. While industry giant BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's steady sales momentum has been a positive signal. The intense competition has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, even as rivals like Xiaomi enter the market with aggressively priced models.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japanese imports if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This move would significantly increase the current 10% levy on most Japanese goods and the 25% tax on vehicles. Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo could be reached, while Japan's chief cabinet secretary stated the country would not make concessions harmful to its agricultural sector. The threat escalates trade tensions as a 90-day pause on broader global tariffs is set to expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking the status in September, as had been planned. The judge determined that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration date in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential shift would involve de-emphasizing the marketing of its 18A process technology to external clients and focusing resources on the next-generation 14A process. This move aims to better compete with rival TSMC and win major customers like Apple and Nvidia. Such a change could result in a substantial financial write-off but is being considered as part of a broader effort to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited a remote migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz" due to its isolated and inhospitable location. The center, surrounded by swamps, was rapidly constructed by the state to support the administration's immigration crackdown. Trump praised the facility's construction and noted the natural deterrents, stating the surrounding alligators serve as unpaid "bodyguards." The site, which can house up to 3,000 people, is part of a broader strategy to ramp up deportations and has drawn criticism from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing private Medicaid enrollee data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of sensitive information—including names, addresses, and social security numbers—violates federal privacy laws like HIPAA. The data pertains to states that use their own funds to provide coverage for non-U.S. citizens. Attorneys general argue this action creates a culture of fear, potentially deterring people from seeking essential medical care, and could be used to locate migrants for deportation.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing potential fines in France after the country's consumer protection agency found its subsidiary engaged in "deceptive commercial practices." The investigation, prompted by consumer complaints, focused on misleading claims about the fully autonomous driving capabilities of its vehicles, as well as issues with trade-in offers and order refunds. The agency has given Tesla four months to cease these practices or face daily fines of $58,000. This issue adds to Tesla's challenges in Europe, where it has also experienced a significant drop in sales.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for crossing the southern border illegally reached a new historic low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions. This continues an unprecedented decline in illegal immigration, which the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures. For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. These figures stand in sharp contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, which often exceeded 6,000 per day.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% ahead of its Q2 delivery report, a drop linked to a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The feud ignited over Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and EV tax credits. Trump retorted by suggesting Musk could lose more than just his "EV mandate," alluding to the billions in government contracts his companies rely on. This political clash adds to market uncertainty as Wall Street anticipates a 13% year-over-year decline in Tesla's vehicle deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>
