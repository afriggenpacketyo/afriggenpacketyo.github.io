          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is enacting a 21% budget reduction after its board approved the cut in response to recent congressional legislation. The funding decrease stems from a $1 billion cut to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a key financial supporter of both PBS and NPR. This move is expected to have a significant impact on local member stations, particularly smaller ones and those in rural areas, with some like NJ PBS already planning staff reductions.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is facing intensified criticism from Democratic lawmakers and union leaders over its enforcement tactics, which have been described as a "mass deportation operation." In Pennsylvania, a union official compared the agency's actions to kidnapping, while state lawmakers introduced a bill to prevent officers from obscuring their identities. Similar concerns about conditions and lack of transparency were raised by lawmakers after visiting ICE facilities in Maryland and Colorado, reflecting a growing political backlash.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum reveals that children experiencing a mental health crisis are frequently left waiting in emergency departments for days before receiving appropriate care. The research found that roughly one in ten such visits for children on Medicaid results in them being "boarded" for three days or longer. This widespread issue is attributed to a severe nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for young people, a situation that can exacerbate their symptoms.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, reaching Category 1 strength as it moves over the ocean. The National Hurricane Center is urging Caribbean islands to monitor the storm, which is expected to bring heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions. While Erin is forecast to become a major hurricane, current projection models show it curving northward, likely keeping it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address rising levels of theft, the U.K. supermarket chain Iceland will begin offering a £1 reward to customers who report shoplifters to store staff. The credit will be applied to the shopper's loyalty card for a verified report of a theft in progress. The company states that shoplifting costs its business approximately £20 million per year, and this initiative aims to involve the community in crime prevention.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has penalized the University of Michigan with a fine of around $30 million and four years of probation for its football sign-stealing scandal. The team will retain its 2023 national championship title, but former coach Jim Harbaugh received an extended 10-year show-cause penalty, which could complicate any future return to college coaching. The staff member responsible for the scheme, Connor Stalions, was given an eight-year show-cause sanction for his central role.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly altered the U.S. foreign policy process by centralizing major decisions within a small circle of loyal advisers, including the Vice President and Secretary of State. This new structure bypasses the traditional, broader-based National Security Council process, allowing the president to act more decisively on his instincts. However, critics and former officials warn that this approach limits expert input, stifles debate, and increases the risk of unforeseen negative consequences.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit filed by environmental groups alleges the Trump administration secretly commissioned a report from climate contrarians to justify rolling back key environmental protections. The suit claims the Department of Energy report, which downplays the harms of greenhouse gas emissions, was created without public oversight and is now being used by the EPA to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding. Critics argue the report is scientifically flawed and serves a purely political agenda to weaken climate regulations.</p>
