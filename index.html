          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, alleging the company is engaging in anticompetitive practices by making it difficult for his AI company, xAI, to rank highly in the App Store. Musk claims Apple's system unfairly favors OpenAI's ChatGPT, which is integrated into Apple's operating systems and featured in its "Must-Have Apps" section. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's partnership with OpenAI over security concerns and comes amid existing antitrust scrutiny of Apple by the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to formalize the extension, which maintains the current tariff rates of 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on American goods to China. The delay provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and other economic issues, although trade volumes between the two nations have already seen a notable decline this year.

          <p>Nepal has announced that it will waive climbing fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years in an effort to boost tourism in its more remote and less developed western provinces. This initiative contrasts with a recent fee increase for climbing Mount Everest, which remains the country's primary source of mountaineering revenue. Officials hope the move will attract climbers to unexplored areas, creating jobs and strengthening local economies, though concerns remain about the lack of infrastructure in these regions.</p>

The incident, which occurred in a mechanical regulating room, triggered multiple secondary explosions and a large-scale emergency response from numerous local fire and EMS services. While the plant has been stabilized and a stay-at-home order for nearby residents was lifted, the event has prompted responses from lawmakers and raised concerns about safety at the nation's largest coke manufacturing facility.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the president's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has been publicly supported by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, with the president stating his nominee will ensure the agency's data is "HONEST and ACCURATE."

Wang advocates for targeted policies that guide the industry toward high-quality development and innovation, moving away from a zero-sum, cash-burning mindset toward a more sustainable ecosystem.

          <p>Colorado is battling several large wildfires, with more than 1,000 firefighters deployed to contain the blazes under challenging weather conditions. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth-largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to gusty winds and extremely dry fuels. Governor Jared Polis has declared a disaster emergency to support response efforts, as evacuations are in place for several communities and smoke prompts air quality warnings across the region.</p>

          <h2>Report Finds Trump's Narrative on D.C. Crime is Based on Misleading Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police force reveals his claims about rampant crime are rooted in false and misleading information. The article points out that while Trump focuses on 2023 crime statistics, current data shows violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low and has dropped significantly in 2025. This tactic mirrors the president's previous actions in Los Angeles, where he also portrayed a city in chaos to justify deploying the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have filed a whistleblowing complaint with the Charity Commission, warning the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint alleges misuse of public funds and a "toxic internal culture," and comes after the UK's Technology Secretary threatened to withdraw its £100m in funding. The government is pushing the institute to pivot its research focus toward defense and national security, a move that has triggered a "crisis in governance" according to the concerned staff.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter has revealed the intense psychological impact of racism in the sport, stating she felt a "sigh of relief" when white teammates also missed penalties in a crucial shootout. She feared that if her Black teammate, Lauren James, had been the only one to miss, the racist abuse would have been "astronomical." Carter, who was also a target of online racism during the tournament, said the abuse made her feel "small" and "scared" to play in the final.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mystery surrounding the disappearance of cyclist Tony Parsons in Scotland was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman named Dr. Caroline Muirhead.

After he showed her the remote burial site, Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later alerted the police, leading them directly to the shallow grave and bringing the case to a close.</p>

          <p>President Trump's upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska is being framed as a bilateral meeting, pointedly excluding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article suggests this positions the talks as a direct power play between the two leaders, with Trump focused on a potential "land swapping" deal to end the war. The president has expressed confidence in his dealmaking ability but has also set low expectations, while his recent domestic law-and-order crackdown is seen as a move to project strength ahead of the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, President Trump met with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and praised his "amazing story" of success, just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation. The initial demand followed a senator's questions about Tan's ties to China. After the meeting, which included cabinet secretaries, Trump stated that Tan and his team would be bringing suggestions to him, marking a stark change in tone and causing Intel's stock to rise in extended trading.
