          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, reported first-quarter results that surpassed expectations, with profit before tax at $9.48 billion and revenue at $17.65 billion; however, these figures represent a 25% and 15% decrease, respectively, compared to the previous year. Despite these declines, profit before tax saw a significant increase of nearly 317% from the previous quarter. The bank's restructuring plan, initiated last October, aims to streamline operations into Eastern and Western market sectors, projecting cost reductions of $300 million this year. DBS Bank's equity research analyst, Manyi Lu, suggests that while global trade uncertainties and potential recession headwinds exist, their full impact is expected to be more evident in subsequent quarters.

          <p>In Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, three teenagers were wounded in a shooting incident, prompting a police search for the gunman. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to a call regarding a multi-victim shooting on North Soto Street, where they found a 15-year-old, a 16-year-old, and an 18-year-old with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. All three victims were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The suspect, described as a heavyset man wearing a tie-dyed sweatshirt and blue pants, was last seen heading northbound on North Soto Street in a gray BMW sedan, leading to a large law enforcement response and the closure of the street.</p>

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano delivered five shutout innings, allowing five hits and striking out eight, as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the New York Yankees 4-3. The 35-year-old rookie pitcher earned his third win of the season during the game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Sugano navigated a bases-loaded situation in the first inning and demonstrated improved pitch sequencing, particularly with his splitter. Ryan O'Hearn's three-run home run in the home half of the third inning provided the Orioles with a 4-0 lead, contributing to Sugano's first scoreless outing in six Major League Baseball games.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured victory in Canada's federal election, capitalizing on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment. This marks a significant turnaround for the party, which was previously considered unlikely to win. While the Liberals are projected to win more seats than the Conservatives, it remains uncertain whether they will secure a majority. Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canadian sovereignty played a pivotal role in the election, shifting the focus to leadership and economic survival, with Carney leveraging this to his advantage by running against Trump as much as his Conservative rival, Pierre Poilievre.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Party of Canada has won the federal election, according to projections, marking a surprising shift influenced by U.S. President Trump's actions. Voters chose between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, with the Liberals projected to win the most seats, although a majority is not yet assured. Trump's threat to annex Canada and his tariffs significantly shaped the campaign, overshadowing domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Trump's comments and Poilievre's perceived similarities to the U.S. president may have impacted the election's outcome.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, stating it was not an error despite a previous withholding order protecting him from removal due to gang persecution risks.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny his gang affiliation and note his lack of criminal record. El Salvador's president has refused to send Abrego Garcia back to the United States, and a federal judge has paused orders requiring the Trump administration to provide updates on its efforts to facilitate his return.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of the value of a new car in the first year, phased out over two years.

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement efforts to include unaccompanied minors, conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the US alone, often across the US-Mexican border. These actions have raised concerns about a crackdown and potential "backdoor family separation." The president has also signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. These actions are part of a broader immigration crackdown by the administration, leading to fears and alarm among critics.</p>

Studies attribute the increase in saltwater intrusion to drought, sea level rise, severe storms, and dredging. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has built an underwater barrier to stop the saltwater from flowing further north, but a more permanent solution is needed.</p>
