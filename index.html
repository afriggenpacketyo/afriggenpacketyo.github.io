          <p>The White House confirmed President Trump is considering a lawsuit against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over alleged mismanagement of Fed building renovations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also stated the administration will reevaluate the federalization of D.C. police and the National Guard deployment after a 30-day period focused on crime reduction. Regarding an upcoming summit with Vladimir Putin, Leavitt explained it was at Putin's request and is a "listening exercise" for Trump to better understand how to end the war in Ukraine, noting President Zelenskyy was not invited.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. As of Tuesday, the storm was located far from the U.S. but early models suggest it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The storm has already caused significant flooding and at least eight fatalities in the Cabo Verde islands off the African coast. Forecasters note uncertainty in its long-term path, though most models show it turning northwest and away from the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>The Israeli non-governmental organization IsraAID is acting as a key facilitator between the Israeli military and international aid groups to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Gaza. CEO Yotam Polizer highlighted the severe humanitarian situation, emphasizing the need for food, medicine, and nutritional supplements to combat malnutrition. The organization began assisting after global partners faced difficulties with customs and military approvals for aid shipments. Polizer stressed that supporting humanitarian efforts in Gaza does not equate to being anti-Israel, pointing to significant support from the U.S. Jewish community.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the celebration of President Trump's tariff policy as a success is based on flawed reasoning. The author contends that while tariffs do generate revenue, this money comes from American importers and consumers, not foreign countries, effectively acting as a tax hike on Americans. The piece refutes claims that experts were wrong about the negative impacts, noting that the most dire predictions were based on a plan Trump quickly abandoned. The author concludes that the true economic consequences, such as rising prices and a weakening dollar, will take time to fully materialize.</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer to Acquire Google's Chrome Browser</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 13:29:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprise $34.5 billion bid to purchase the Chrome browser from Google, a figure that exceeds its own current valuation. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the internet search market.

The act mandates that agencies inspect all prior employment records, including performance and fitness-for-duty evaluations, before making a final hiring decision.

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts but don't need the income, financial planners suggest several strategic options. One approach is to reinvest the funds in a brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that can satisfy the RMD requirement. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan can also provide state tax benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the district, which was run by presidentially appointed commissioners for a century before the Home Rule Act of 1973 allowed for an elected mayor and council. Even with home rule, Congress retains significant power, and a federal "Control Board" took over the city's finances during a bankruptcy crisis in the 1990s.

          <p>Amid market volatility and persistent inflation, annuities are often considered for securing a predictable retirement income, but their safety depends on several factors. An annuity's security is tied to the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, not FDIC backing, making it crucial to choose highly-rated insurers. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, the primary long-term risk is inflation eroding the purchasing power of fixed payments. Different types, such as fixed versus variable annuities, carry vastly different risk profiles, requiring careful selection based on an individual's financial goals and risk tolerance.

AST SpaceMobile, which currently has six satellites in orbit, plans to launch service in the U.S. by the end of the year. The ambitious plan positions the Texas-based company as a significant player in the growing space broadband technology market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is seeking monetary sanctions against Joshua Schroeder, a California-based immigration attorney who filed emergency motions to prevent the deportation of his Hmong client. The administration argues Schroeder made "meritless contentions" and engaged in a "pattern of knowing or reckless misrepresentations" in his filings. This action is seen by advocates as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to intimidate immigration lawyers and hamper legal challenges to its aggressive deportation policies. Schroeder's attempts to block his client's removal to Laos were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>

The World Health Organization has also appealed to Israel to allow it to pre-stock hospitals with medical supplies to handle the catastrophic health situation. Israel's war cabinet recently approved the occupation of Gaza City to dismantle remaining Hamas strongholds.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 103,000 F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023 to 2025 due to a problem with the rear axle hub bolt. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the bolt can fatigue and break, which could lead to a loss of drive power or cause the vehicle to roll away if the parking brake is not engaged. Both of these potential outcomes increase the risk of a crash. Ford will notify owners, and dealers will replace the rear axle shaft assemblies free of charge to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has the authority to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force, that power is subject to a significant legal constraint. The 1974 Home Rule Act allows the president to take control of the city's police during a self-declared emergency, but it explicitly states this control must end after 30 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution to extend it. Although the president's determination of an "emergency" is broad, legal experts note the 30-day limit is firm. This provides a crucial check on the president's power, preventing an indefinite takeover of the capital's local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, author Anne Lamott reflects on finding hope amidst a terrifying political climate. She argues that in addition to activism, absurdity and laughter, exemplified by Monty Python, are essential tools for survival and resistance, as humor is a form of fearlessness that agitates bullies. Recounting a mishap at a nail salon where her finger was accidentally super-glued to the manicurist's, she finds a moment of shared humanity and kindness in the absurd situation. She concludes that doing hopeful things, like showing kindness and remembering to laugh, is how we can maintain our spirits.</p>

          <p>A Delaware real estate agent, Zachary Foust, has gone viral for a passionate video explaining why homeownership is increasingly out of reach for the working class. He argues that the American Dream has been eroded by decades of policy decisions, from tax cuts for the wealthy to the rise of institutional investors buying up housing stock. Foust points to the significant market share of investors—nearly 27% of home sales in early 2025—as a key factor driving up prices. He encourages young people not to give up, advising them to save aggressively, even if it means living with family.</p>

Musk claimed Apple has made it "impossible" for other apps to compete with OpenAI in its App Store, a charge that comes after Apple announced a partnership with the AI firm. The conflict stems from Musk's belief that OpenAI, which he co-founded, has abandoned its original non-profit, open-source mission in favor of maximizing profits for investors like Microsoft.

The driver of the other vehicle involved told police the teen was alone in the car and that the mother asked him to lie for her.
