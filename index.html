          <h2>US Economic Growth Rebounded to 3% in Second Quarter, Driven by Trade Fluctuations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:29:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from the previous quarter's contraction. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports following the implementation of new tariffs, which skews the overall picture of economic health. While consumer spending saw a modest increase, a key underlying metric known as "final sales to private domestic purchasers" showed its weakest growth since late 2022, suggesting that domestic demand is weakening despite the strong headline number. Economists caution that the growth rate overstates the economy's true strength, with the average for the first half of 2025 being a more modest 1.25%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>High-Income American Households Increasingly Delinquent on Credit Card and Auto Loan Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:28:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even households earning over $150,000 annually are experiencing a significant rise in delinquencies on credit card and auto loan payments, more than doubling since 2023. This trend, highlighted by VantageScore data, suggests that financial strain is affecting a broader segment of the population, not just lower-income groups. Economists attribute this shift to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and rising housing costs, which are eroding the financial cushion wealthier Americans previously enjoyed. While overall delinquency rates remain higher for lower-income consumers, the accelerated increase among high earners signals potential widespread economic stress, as their spending constitutes a major part of the economy.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 12:25:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three people have been arrested and charged in connection with a large street brawl in Cincinnati that gained national attention after footage went viral online. Montianez Merriweather, Dekyra Vernon, and Jermaine Matthews face charges of assault and aggravated riot, with the first two also facing felonious assault charges. The incident, which involved multiple violent altercations including a woman being punched unconscious, drew commentary from political figures like Vice-President JD Vance. The virality of the video also sparked a debate about racial motivations, though police and some community members have cautioned against such conclusions, noting the complexity of the event and that individuals of multiple races were involved on all sides.</p>

The blast, which occurred on Tuesday, tore apart the facility and caused a persistent fire that hampered rescue and recovery efforts. Local residents reported their houses shaking from the force of the explosion, which left the plant's structure severely damaged.

While convicted on two assault charges, the jury could not reach a verdict on an alleged assault against a third, male officer. The defense argued that Amaaz acted in self-defense, claiming the officers used unlawful force, but the court ultimately convicted him for the attacks on the female officers and a separate assault on a member of the public.</p>

Lawyers representing families of other British hostages echoed these concerns, stating the UK's proposal could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining captives.

Citing a statute that allows five members of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel to request such information, they have set an August 15 deadline. This move intensifies pressure on the Trump administration, which Democrats accuse of reneging on earlier promises to declassify the documents. The request comes amid criticism of Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the files and follows the DOJ's separate, more limited effort to release grand jury transcripts from the case.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is set to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, with Wall Street anticipating strong revenue growth of around 14% year-over-year. Investor focus will be on the performance of its Azure cloud computing business and the company's massive capital expenditures on data centers to support surging AI demand. Analysts project Azure growth to be around 35%, a key indicator of Microsoft's competitive standing against rivals like Amazon and Google in the cloud and AI sectors. The report will provide insight into whether the company's significant investments in AI infrastructure are translating into sustained financial gains and market expansion.

          <p>Meta is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors keenly focused on the company's escalating costs related to its aggressive push into artificial intelligence. Analysts will be scrutinizing any updates to financial guidance following CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent multi-billion-dollar AI hiring spree, which included a major investment in Scale AI and the creation of a new Meta Superintelligence Labs. The central question is how this significant spending will impact profitability and benefit the company's core advertising business. Despite the high costs, some analysts anticipate that Meta's quarterly sales could meet or exceed the higher end of its previous guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

Local authorities noted that lifeguards had finished their shifts for the day and that a yellow flag, advising caution, had been in place due to the challenging water conditions.

          <p>The U.S. rental market is experiencing a slowdown, with national apartment rents remaining flat in July and falling 0.8% compared to the previous year. According to a report from Apartment List, the national vacancy rate climbed to a record 7.1%, driven by a massive surge of new apartment construction over the past few years that has outpaced demand. This oversupply has created more favorable conditions for renters, particularly in formerly hot markets in the South and Mountain West, such as Austin, Texas, which has seen the steepest rent declines. While construction is expected to slow, ongoing economic uncertainty continues to dampen rental demand during the peak moving season. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed legislation would require companies to notify the Department of Labor before moving call center operations overseas and would make them ineligible for certain federal loans and grants. To protect consumers, the bill mandates that agents disclose their physical location and whether AI is being used, with an option for callers to be transferred to a U.S.-based representative. The bill aims to address concerns about job displacement from both offshoring and the increasing use of artificial intelligence in customer service roles.</p>

Camp owners attribute the trend to a collective yearning for simplicity and community in a complicated world, especially amid rising levels of burnout and loneliness. For a weekend of planned activities like rock climbing and watersports, attendees can escape their routines and connect with others in a fun, structured environment, addressing the difficulty many adults face in forming new social connections.</p>

          <p>In a move urged by President Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a proposed congressional redistricting map that could secure them up to five additional seats in the U.S. House. The aggressive gerrymander would create 30 districts favorable to Republicans, compared to just eight for Democrats, in a state the GOP already largely controls. The plan involves redrawing districts to dilute Democratic votes, such as merging two Democratic-held seats in Austin and altering boundaries in South Texas. Democrats have condemned the map as a racially discriminatory power grab that will face immediate and fierce legal challenges for violating voting rights.</p>

          <p>Despite a relentless public campaign of criticism against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Trump has not moved to fire him, a decision rooted in legal and market realities. This analytical article explores the concept of central bank independence, designed to insulate monetary policy from short-term political pressures like Trump's demands for lower interest rates. Firing Powell would be legally dubious and would likely trigger market chaos, leading to higher interest rates—the opposite of Trump's goal. The situation illustrates the inherent tension between a president's desire for economic stimulus and the Fed's mandate to maintain long-term price stability, with market stability acting as the ultimate check on presidential power.</p>

In an interview, Lula urged for a negotiated "middle ground" on economic issues but emphasized that Bolsonaro's legal situation is a non-negotiable judicial matter.
