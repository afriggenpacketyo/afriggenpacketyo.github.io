          <p>Shares of Intel fell after former President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing significant conflicts of interest. Trump's call follows concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, some of which are linked to the country's military. These developments have cast a shadow over Intel's leadership and its role in U.S. national security, particularly as a recipient of taxpayer funds for domestic chip production, raising questions about the company's future direction and stability.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International delivered mixed second-quarter results, with revenues surpassing expectations but earnings per share falling short. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and growth at Tim Hortons and Burger King, which helped to offset a 1.4% decline in same-store sales at its Popeyes chain. CEO Josh Kobza noted a modest improvement in the consumer environment and reaffirmed the company's full-year forecast, signaling confidence in its long-term growth strategy despite challenges in some segments of its portfolio.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee narrowly voted 5-4 to lower its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%, continuing a cautious approach to monetary easing. The decision reflects the challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which remains above the 2% target, against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. While the move provides some relief for borrowers, policymakers remain divided, signaling that the path for future rate adjustments is highly uncertain and dependent on incoming economic data.

          <p>The U.S. has imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods and threatened secondary sanctions over India's continued oil trade with Russia, but India's government and markets have shown little panic. Officials view the move as a pressure tactic, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has gained opposition support to resist what is being called "economic blackmail." While certain sectors like gems and textiles face significant impacts, India's economy is bolstered by strong domestic consumption, and negotiators are expected to hold firm, particularly on issues affecting farmers.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's vital semiconductor industry is under significant pressure following President Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips unless manufacturers establish operations in the United States. This comes as a separate 20% U.S. tariff on a wide range of Taiwanese goods has already taken effect, rattling the island's export-driven economy. While major firms like TSMC may be exempt due to existing U.S. investments, the policy forces other tech companies into a costly choice between facing prohibitive tariffs or shifting production to America.</p>

          <p>India has sent its first official delegation to Damascus to engage with Syria's new provisional government, which took power after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime. The move is seen as a pragmatic effort to understand the new leadership's priorities and ensure India is not sidelined in the country's future reconstruction and regional dynamics. Experts suggest this outreach reinforces India's non-aligned stance and protects its strategic interests, including trade routes and regional stability, by building early ties with the new power center in the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has significantly lowered its annual operating profit forecast by over $4 billion, attributing the revision to the financial impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Although the company's June-quarter revenue exceeded estimates, its operating profit fell by 11% year-on-year, with the automaker stating that tariffs were responsible for approximately 450 billion yen in losses. The move highlights the substantial pressure on Japanese carmakers, who have been forced to absorb higher costs or cut prices to maintain market share in the critical U.S. market.</p>

          <p>In a significant development in a racially charged murder case in South Africa, charges have been dropped against Adrian de Wet, one of three men accused of killing two Black women and feeding their bodies to pigs. De Wet has turned state witness and will testify that the farm owner, Zachariah Johannes Olivier, was the one who shot the women. The case, which has highlighted ongoing racial tensions in rural South Africa, will proceed against the farm owner and another worker, while de Wet will be placed in protective custody.</p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a nationwide ground stop for several hours due to a significant technology issue, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco. The airline confirmed the problem was internal and not related to cybersecurity or the broader air traffic control system. After resolving the outage, United lifted the ground stop and began working to clear a backlog of flights, though residual delays were expected to continue as operations returned to normal across its network.</p>

This discovery is part of a growing global trend where receding glaciers, a consequence of climate change, are revealing the remains of hikers and climbers who disappeared decades ago in various mountain ranges around the world.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has detained the first group of migrants who crossed the English Channel under its new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. The agreement, which came into force this week, allows the UK to return a migrant to France in exchange for accepting a vetted asylum seeker who has not attempted an illegal crossing. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those detained will be held until their removal, which could happen within weeks, as the government aims to deter illegal crossings and robustly defend against legal challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing a standoff with Jingye Group, the Chinese owners of British Steel, over demands for hundreds of millions of pounds to complete the transfer of the company. The government took control of the Scunthorpe steelworks in April to prevent its closure but has stopped short of full nationalization, hoping for a smooth handover. Jingye's valuation of the loss-making company is vastly different from the government's, stalling the search for a new buyer and creating uncertainty about the long-term future of thousands of steel jobs.</p>

          <p>This essay delves into the cultural and psychological appeal of survivalism, tracing its roots from 1970s counter-culture to modern-day billionaire "preppers." The author contrasts the resourceful "survivor" archetype, who seeks to rejoin civilization, with the "survivalist," who often fantasizes about societal collapse as a liberating event. Through an analysis of fiction from H.G. Wells to Cormac McCarthy, the article argues that while these stories can be empowering fantasies, they often promote a bleak, individualistic worldview that overlooks humanity's capacity for mutual aid in real-world disasters.</p>

Education advocates warn these agreements set a dangerous precedent, emboldening the administration to use coercive tactics and the "weaponization of federal funds" to enforce ideological conformity on campuses. The settlements require universities to submit to government oversight and review curricula, which critics argue severely undermines their academic independence and autonomy.</p>

          <p>A scholar writing in a top Communist Party publication has suggested that China must maintain an average annual GDP growth rate of at least 4.5% to 5% during its next five-year plan. This pace is deemed necessary to achieve the national goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country," approximately $30,000, by the year 2035.

Millennials are abandoning boomer habits like prioritizing homeownership over renting, relying on pensions, and staying with one employer, as they navigate higher living costs and greater job market volatility. Instead, they are more open to discussing finances, utilizing digital investment tools, and job-hopping for better pay, adapting their strategies to build wealth in a world where traditional paths to security are no longer guaranteed.</p>
