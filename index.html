          <p>Best-selling author and illustrator Charlie Mackesy revealed his new book, "Always Remember," took six years to complete after his iPad, containing many initial drawings and writings, was stolen from his unlocked car. This significant setback, combined with personal grief over losing his mother and beloved dog, tested his artistic and personal resilience. Mackesy, famous for "The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse," emphasizes finding purpose in connecting with others through his art and describes receiving thousands of emails from people whose lives were touched by his work. He now invests his earnings in rewilding efforts, planting thousands of trees, and plans future projects including a collaboration with the V&A Museum, while vowing to lock his car.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, as investors increasingly seek safe-haven assets amidst heightened global economic and political uncertainty. This significant rally, the largest since the 1970s, is attributed to factors such as US tariffs disrupting global trade, delays in crucial economic data due to the ongoing US government shutdown, and a weakening US dollar. While analysts suggest potential dips if the shutdown resolves swiftly or interest rates increase, many foresee a continued upward trend for gold over the next five years. The article underscores gold's enduring appeal as a hedge against market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Zealand's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing the policy rate to 2.5%, its lowest level since July 2022, to stimulate economic growth. This larger-than-anticipated reduction by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) was driven by concerns over weak economic activity in mid-2025 and confidence that inflation is moderating towards its 2% target by early next year. The RBNZ noted that slow growth in disposable incomes and house prices continues to weigh on the economy, with lower interest rates now intended to support a recovery in consumption. Growth forecasts for several of New Zealand's trading partners, particularly in Asia, have shown improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in Portland, Oregon, particularly near an ICE building, are enduring nightly clashes between federal agents and anti-immigration protesters, describing their neighborhood as a "war zone." President Trump's threat to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest has been temporarily halted by a federal judge, who questioned the president's constitutional authority. While some residents blame Antifa and others federal agents for inciting violence, the ongoing situation has led to a school relocating and residents arming themselves. The article highlights the divided opinions within the community and the broader political implications of federal intervention in local protests.</p>

Both races have recently intensified with controversies, including a data breach of Sherrill's military records and Spanberger facing criticism over her Democratic attorney general nominee's inflammatory texts.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestine protest on Boston Common escalated into violence on Tuesday night, leading to the arrest of 13 individuals and injuries to four police officers, two of whom required hospital treatment for broken bones. The incident occurred on the second anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks on Israel, as the crowd moved from the Common into the streets. Police reported that protesters turned on officers, kicking a cruiser, assaulting them, blocking traffic, and setting off devices that released clouds of red smoke. Authorities are currently investigating the full extent of the officers' injuries and are expected to release more details.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump authorized using Section 232 tariff revenue to sustain the WIC nutrition program during the ongoing government shutdown, aiming to prevent a lapse in funds for low-income mothers and children. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of "cruelly voting to shut down the government," which she claimed forced WIC to face funding exhaustion. This "creative solution," developed by the Office of Management and Budget, is a temporary measure expected to cover program costs for the foreseeable future while congressional budget negotiations remain deadlocked.

This upcoming general election is widely viewed as a significant indicator of President Trump's second-term agenda popularity, particularly among Republican-leaning suburban voters in the Nashville area. The 7th Congressional District is considered a safely Republican seat, and a GOP hold would slightly expand their slim House majority.</p>

The city argues the ban is impractical and overly broad, claiming it puts officers at risk by potentially causing hesitation in chaotic situations.

          <p>US air travelers are experiencing a second day of widespread flight delays and cancellations, as the ongoing government shutdown exacerbates a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Airports in Nashville, Dallas, Chicago, and Newark are particularly affected, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reporting staffing levels sometimes dropping to 50%. Air traffic controllers, designated as essential workers, are required to work without pay, leading to increased stress and sick calls. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued ground delays, and union officials warn of overworked and unpaid staff, emphasizing the strain on safety. This situation echoes the 2019 shutdown, which saw similar disruptions and ultimately contributed to its resolution.</p>

          <p>Indonesia, encouraged by China's successful role in building Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway on Java, is now actively seeking further Chinese investment for additional infrastructure projects, such as an urban subway in Bali. The Jakarta-Bandung line, constructed by the China Railway Construction Corporation, has already transported millions of passengers, significantly reducing travel time. While many Indonesians express confidence in China's capacity to expand their national travel network across the archipelago, the article implicitly raises important questions about the potential debt implications of such extensive foreign investment. The Bali Urban Subway, also under construction by CRCC, is expected to open its first line in 2031 to address severe traffic congestion.</p>

Authorities responded to the blaze on October 1st, finding no one inside the fire-damaged residence. Attempts to contact Gard, who was last seen on September 30th and notably missed her daughter's volleyball game, have been unsuccessful, with her car and purse found at home, intensifying concerns. A drone-assisted search of the area and searches of a pond on the property yielded no clues.

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to announce a new economic "golden rule" designed to significantly cut government borrowing and taxes. Under this proposed rule, half of all future savings made by a Conservative government would be allocated to reducing the national deficit, while the other half would fund policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, including tax cuts. Badenoch plans to accuse the current Labour government of risking the UK's financial stability with a "borrowing and tax doom loop," thereby attempting to reclaim the mantle of financial prudence. The Conservatives have already pledged £47bn in annual savings from cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has rolled out "affordable" versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan in the US, with starting prices of $39,990 and $36,990 respectively. CEO Elon Musk had previously touted the potential for a sub-$30,000 price point after incentives, leading to some disappointment among analysts and investors who feel the new prices aren't sufficiently low to attract a new class of buyers. The company is strategically trying to reverse falling sales amidst rising competition in Europe and China, and the recent loss of a $7,500 US tax credit. These new models offer reduced premium finishes and features but maintain impressive driving ranges exceeding 300 miles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the Insurrection Act, a US federal law that grants the president the power to deploy military forces or federalize National Guard troops inside the US to quell domestic uprisings. Enacted in 1807, this act serves as a statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the military from participating in civilian law enforcement activities. The Insurrection Act has been invoked on dozens of occasions, notably during the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. President Trump has repeatedly threatened its use, particularly concerning immigration enforcement and protests, raising significant concerns about civil liberties and potential federal overreach. While courts have historically shown deference, this is not absolute immunity from review.</p>

This significant reduction is attributed to the Trump administration's sweeping clampdown on illegal immigration, which includes sealing the border, closing asylum systems using emergency powers, and deploying thousands of soldiers.

Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, argues the 2019 law unconstitutionally censors her ability to discuss gender dysphoria and sexual orientation with young patients who seek to align their identity and sex or reduce same-sex attractions. Colorado maintains its law regulates harmful medical practices, not speech, and aims to protect minors from ineffective and potentially damaging treatments. Justices appeared skeptical of Colorado's interpretation, questioning potential viewpoint discrimination.
