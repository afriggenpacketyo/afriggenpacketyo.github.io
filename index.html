          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, an industry veteran with nearly three decades of experience at carriers like Delta and Alaska Airlines, as its new chief commercial officer. The move follows the ousting of the previous CCO after a business-travel strategy failed, leading to a sharp drop in revenue projections and straining relationships with corporate clients. Pieper, who most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance, will oversee American's commercial strategy, loyalty program, and network planning. His appointment is aimed at stabilizing the airline's commercial leadership and improving its profitability, which has been lagging behind competitors.</p>

          <p>The planned reopening of Khartoum's main international airport in Sudan has been disrupted by a series of drone attacks, reportedly launched by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The airport had been closed for 30 months due to the country's ongoing civil war between the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The government had intended the reopening to signal a return to normalcy and control over the capital. While one domestic flight did land, the continued strikes have delayed a full resumption of services, undermining the government's efforts to stabilize the region amid a devastating humanitarian crisis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's construction of a new ballroom in the White House's East Wing is not a personal vanity project, but rather a necessary addition that celebrates American power and grandeur. The author contrasts this project with past renovations by other presidents, which are framed as serving personal tastes, suggesting the ballroom will be a timeless monument for the nation. The piece contends that objections from the political left stem from a reluctance to celebrate America's global dominance. It concludes that the privately funded ballroom is a fitting contribution to the nation's executive mansion.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police officer, PC Philip Neilson, has been dismissed with immediate effect for gross misconduct following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation. A disciplinary panel upheld allegations that he made highly racist and discriminatory remarks about various ethnic groups, including suggesting a detainee should have a 'bullet through his head.' Neilson is the first of ten current or former officers to face accelerated misconduct hearings resulting from the investigation. The panel's chair described the officer's conduct as an 'utter disgrace' that caused significant harm to public confidence in the police force.</p>

          <p>Growth in rents for single-family homes in the U.S. slowed to a 1.4% annual increase in August, the lowest level recorded in 15 years, according to a new report from Cotality.

Cities like Chicago saw strong growth, while Dallas experienced a decline due to a surge in new apartment supply. The data reflects a broader cooling in the rental market, including for multifamily apartments, as a construction boom increases housing availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Colorado River basin is facing a critical water shortage due to a warming climate and overuse, jeopardizing water security for 40 million people across seven U.S. states and Mexico.

States in the Upper and Lower Basins are in tense negotiations to establish new water-sharing rules after 2026, with conflicts arising over historical water rights and consumption levels. Experts warn that immediate and significant reductions in water use, particularly in agriculture which consumes the majority of the river's water, are necessary to avert a deeper crisis.</p>

          <p>The UK's national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs is facing turmoil as a fifth survivor has quit its advisory panel and called for Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips to resign. The departing survivors have cited concerns that the inquiry's focus is being diluted, and they feel dismissed by the minister after raising these issues. The controversy highlights a fundamental disagreement among survivors on whether the inquiry should remain 'laser-focused' on grooming gangs or be widened to include other forms of child abuse. The situation has been compounded by the withdrawal of two potential candidates to chair the inquiry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the 'existing structure' of the White House East Wing will be torn down to build a new, privately funded $250 million ballroom. The project's scale, which involves a complete demolition rather than a simple addition, has drawn criticism from Democratic politicians and conservationists over a lack of transparency and public review. The White House is exempt from the National Historic Preservation Act, but critics argue that such a significant alteration to the historic site should have faced more scrutiny.

While the adjustment aligns with the long-term average, it is significantly lower than the record 8.7% COLA in 2023, which was a response to high post-pandemic inflation. Advocacy groups argue that the current inflation measure, CPI-W, does not accurately reflect the expenses faced by seniors.

Political turmoil in France is cited as a partial cause for the delay, but legal and safety concerns about the dangers of at-sea interventions are also significant obstacles.

The essay identifies threats to free thought, such as cognitive biases, the spread of propaganda, and the consolidation of media ownership by billionaires.

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested three men, aged 48, 45, and 44, on suspicion of assisting Russia's foreign intelligence service. The arrests were made under the National Security Act of 2023 as part of an ongoing counter-terrorism investigation. A police commander noted an increasing trend of foreign intelligence services recruiting 'proxies' to carry out criminal activities in the UK. The authorities have warned that anyone found to be involved in such activities on behalf of a foreign state will be investigated and face potentially serious legal consequences if convicted of these offenses.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has instituted a new policy for Pentagon press coverage, leading nearly all journalists to turn in their media passes in protest. The new rule requires reporters to sign a document agreeing not to broadcast, print, or request information that the Pentagon has not explicitly authorized for release. This move effectively gives the Defense Secretary's office control over what information is reported about the military. Critics argue this severely curtails press freedom and ensures that the American public's knowledge of military affairs will be limited to officially sanctioned narratives, a significant departure from previous journalistic access.</p>

The deal, which includes wage increases and improved health fund contributions, was announced early Thursday after mediation. The agreement follows a similar deal reached by the Actors' Equity Association, resolving labor tensions that had been building as both unions worked under expired contracts. The resolution prevents a potentially crippling blow to Broadway, which has seen a strong financial recovery since the pandemic, recently recording its highest-grossing season ever.</p>

          <p>A plan to sell a city-owned golf course in Tallahassee, Florida, to a private country club has ignited community outrage because the land contains the unmarked graves of enslaved people. Archaeologists have identified dozens of suspected graves from the plantation that once occupied the site. The country club, which has leased the land for a nominal fee since 1956 in a move historically linked to avoiding desegregation, offered to buy the property. Residents and activists are condemning the proposed sale, arguing that selling the land again disrespects the memory of those buried there and demanding the city prioritize memorializing the site.</p>

This places immense pressure on low-income families and the local food banks that serve as a safety net, which are also facing funding delays.
