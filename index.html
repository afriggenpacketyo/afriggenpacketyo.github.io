          <p>ABC has indefinitely preempted "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group also pulled the show, citing the comments as offensive and not in the public interest. The move drew praise from former President Trump and the FCC Chairman, who suggested there could be regulatory remedies. This incident is part of a broader fallout where several media personalities and a Secret Service agent have faced professional consequences for their public statements regarding Kirk's killing.</p>

          <p>A suspect identified as Donald Henson has been taken into custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office. Authorities are treating the incident as a "targeted attack" on the federal building. Henson, who reportedly has a history of mental health issues and is a former military member, had recently visited the office to make a complaint that was determined to have no federal nexus. No injuries were reported, and Henson now faces federal charges for assaulting a government officer and damaging government property.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is preparing for more job cuts and a significant reduction in its flight schedule as it navigates its second bankruptcy in less than a year. CEO Dave Davis informed employees that the airline will cut its capacity by 25% in November to lower costs and focus on its most profitable markets. The struggling carrier is in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors while evaluating its fleet size, which will likely lead to further workforce reductions. This move follows a period of high costs, a failed acquisition by JetBlue, and weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will only implement moderate easing measures for the remainder of the year. This cautious approach is expected to narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries, potentially easing capital outflow pressures and providing support for the yuan. The PBOC's move to set the yuan's midpoint rate slightly lower reflects this strategy. Economists forecast a small 10 basis point cut by the PBOC later in the year, indicating a focus on stability rather than aggressive stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship is scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station after a delay caused by two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed the issue was resolved, explaining that a conservative software safeguard was responsible for the early engine cutoffs during planned maneuvers. The upgraded and larger Cygnus XL is carrying over 11,000 pounds of essential supplies, research materials, and spare parts for the station's crew.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro described the event as a tragic and devastating day for the commonwealth, ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of the fallen officers.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The declaration, made during a state visit to the UK, raises legal questions as there is no domestic equivalent to the foreign terror organization list, partly due to First Amendment protections. The announcement followed the widespread controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the Charlie Kirk shooting, which led to his show's suspension. Trump praised the network's decision while promoting his plan to label antifa, a move he had previously considered during the 2020 protests.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, to either Algeria or Syria. The ruling states that Khalil failed to disclose his internship with a United Nations agency and his affiliations with an anti-Israel campus coalition on his green card application. Judge Jamee Comans determined these omissions were deliberate and constituted grounds for removal, citing national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil, who was previously arrested by ICE and detained for over three months, plans to appeal the decision, with his legal team arguing it is retaliation for protected political speech.</p>

The author argues that this is a positive development, especially in the current economic climate, as it shows greater individual certainty and societal support for diverse life goals.

The National Academies asserts that scientific understanding has only strengthened since 2009, with new threats identified.

However, she decided against it, believing it was "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man, given the political landscape. Harris writes that while she felt Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner, she was concerned about how much change the American electorate would accept at once. She ultimately selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and this candid reflection highlights the complex calculations of identity and electability within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate the storm will remain over open water for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, the system is expected to intensify and could become a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its current path keeps it away from the U.S. mainland, Bermuda could be in its path next week. The formation of Gabrielle comes after what is historically the peak of the hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Former KTVU news anchor Frank Somerville was arrested on suspicion of assault following a physical altercation with his adult daughter. In a now-deleted social media post, Somerville claimed the fight occurred after his daughter arrived at his home unannounced and a dispute ensued. This marks Somerville's fourth arrest in four years, following previous incidents including DUI charges and an altercation with family members. His attorney described the situation as a delicate family issue and expressed hope that it could be resolved outside of the criminal justice system to avoid further damage to their relationship.</p>

          <h2>Accused Assassin of Charlie Kirk Feared Police and Negotiated Peaceful Surrender, Sheriff Says</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The man accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was reportedly fearful of being shot by law enforcement and agreed to a peaceful surrender with his family's help. According to the Washington County Sheriff, Robinson did not want a SWAT raid on his home and negotiated relaxed conditions for his surrender through a trusted family friend, a retired detective. The sheriff detailed how community ties were used to de-escalate the situation, leading Robinson to turn himself in at the sheriff's office. Robinson has since been charged with aggravated murder, and prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a significant amount of alcohol daily through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content in the figs and plums the chimps eat, finding it averaged around 0.3% by weight. Due to the large quantity of fruit consumed, this amounts to approximately 14 grams of ethanol per day, equivalent to nearly two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. This study provides the first direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee is urging the government not to scrap Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), which are individual care plans for children with special educational needs. Instead, MPs recommend keeping the legally binding plans as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The committee also calls for new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and increased training for teachers. This comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to a system that has been described as financially unsustainable, despite a rising number of children requiring EHCPs.</p>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, tied with Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States. In 2024, approximately 17.7% of residents, or 7 million people, were unable to afford basic necessities. This rate has remained largely unchanged since 2023, following a significant surge after the expiration of pandemic-era aid policies like the federal child tax credit. The report highlights that children and people of color are disproportionately affected and warns that recent state and federal budget cuts could exacerbate the problem, framing poverty as a direct result of policy choices.</p>

This campaign is part of a broader right-wing reaction to Kirk's death, which has also seen militia groups like the Oath Keepers use the event as a recruiting opportunity.
