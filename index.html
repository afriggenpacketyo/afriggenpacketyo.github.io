This performance not only set a new championship record but also established the 24-year-old as the fourth-fastest woman in history. Her victory marks a significant comeback after an injury-plagued 2024 season and concludes a dominant year in women's sprinting. The event also celebrated the career of 38-year-old Jamaican legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who competed in her final world championship.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham warns that the United States is in a dangerous period marked by escalating political violence. He attributes this trend to a fundamental disagreement over American identity and the purpose of politics, noting that such violence historically erupts when questions of who belongs in "We the people" are contested. Meacham urges political leaders and citizens to reject violence, engage in peaceful debate, and draw lessons from historical moments where the nation overcame deep divisions.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist James Fallows draws parallels between the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk and the politically violent era of the 1960s, which saw the murders of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy. He cautions that such cycles of violence are deeply damaging and self-reinforcing, urging leaders to avoid inflammatory rhetoric about "civil war." Fallows emphasizes the importance of generous immediate reactions, citing George W. Bush's outreach to American Muslims after 9/11 and Robert F. Kennedy's call to "tame the savageness of man" as models for navigating the current crisis.</p>

Griffin sided with the family, stating that once the fan dropped the ball, she forfeited her claim to it. He also shared a personal story about his oddest fan interaction during his Heisman Trophy ceremony, where a man who appeared to be in a wheelchair to get an autograph was later seen walking freely. The incident highlights the extreme lengths some fans will go to for sports memorabilia.</p>

          <p>In a joint interview, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) condemned the assassination of Charlie Kirk and discussed the rising threat of political violence in the U.S. Both senators attributed the escalation to the polarizing influence of social media algorithms and called for leaders to lower the rhetorical temperature. They discussed the need for increased security for public officials and highlighted potential bipartisan legislation, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate online harms.

          <p>Following a large "Unite the Kingdom" march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the national flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and fear. The protest, which drew over 150,000 people, resulted in clashes with a smaller counter-protest, leading to 26 police injuries and 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated, reinforcing that the flag represents Britain's diversity and respect.</p>

          <p>France advanced to the Rugby World Cup semi-finals after overcoming a 13-0 halftime deficit to defeat Ireland 18-13 in a tense quarter-final match.

In the second half, France scored 18 unanswered points, with a decisive long-range try from Joanna Grisez sealing the victory. The loss ends Ireland's hopes of reaching their first World Cup semi-final since 2014, continuing their winless streak against the French side since 2017.</p>

          <p>The Art Institute of Chicago is hosting a new exhibition, "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offering a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is famous for his work "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, which often scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The show explores themes of masculinity and sensuousness in his paintings, such as "The Floor Scrapers." Curators aim to re-integrate Caillebotte into the Impressionist narrative, allowing his art to be interpreted through a modern lens beyond the controversy it once generated.</p>

          <p>A columnist argues that President Trump's "no tax on tips" law, while seemingly beneficial for some workers, further entrenches America's problematic tipping culture and places more pressure on consumers. The article critiques the temporary nature of the tax deduction, its income limitations, and the arbitrary list of eligible professions, which includes digital creators but excludes postal workers and teachers. The author suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the government should encourage employers to pay a fair, living wage, similar to practices in other countries, thereby eliminating the obligation and inconsistency inherent in the current system.</p>

          <p>To prepare for the anticipated hostile crowd at the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage in New York, the European team is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that simulate heckling and abuse. Rory McIlroy revealed that captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the intense pressure and noise they will face on American soil. McIlroy confirmed he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," though he declined to share the specific insults used. The innovative approach underscores the team's detailed preparations for their title defense.</p>

          <p>A growing backlash is targeting social media influencers who post videos of themselves provoking and grappling with Australian wildlife, including dangerous crocodiles. One recent video by U.S. citizen Mike Holston, known as "The Real Tarzann," shows him wrestling a crocodile, prompting Queensland authorities to launch an investigation into the "extremely dangerous and illegal" actions. Animal rights groups like PETA are calling for his deportation, arguing that such content is cruel and treats animals as props. Experts worry these viral stunts encourage "copycat tourism," trivializing animal suffering and putting both people and wildlife at risk.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, experts are weighing in on the key storylines and potential outcomes, with many predicting a championship victory for the Minnesota Lynx. The team is seen as being on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals. Led by likely MVP Napheesa Collier, the Lynx boast the league's top defense and strong chemistry. Other contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who are on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty. The absence of rookies Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark is noted as both a loss for rivalries and a chance for other stars to shine.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom (AVGO), Zscaler (ZS), and Oracle (ORCL)—as strong long-term investments, citing their significant potential from the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom's outlook is bolstered by accelerating AI-related demand and a new $10 billion customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is showing robust growth driven by its Zero-Trust portfolio, while Oracle's stock surged after reporting a massive 359% increase in its contracted revenue backlog, largely due to major cloud and AI deals.

          <p>High-level trade delegations from the United States and China have begun their fourth round of face-to-face talks in Madrid, Spain. The meeting aims to address the escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his tariff war earlier in the year. The negotiations, led by key representatives from both nations, are taking place at the Spanish foreign ministry. These continued discussions represent an ongoing effort by the world's two largest economies to find a resolution and de-escalate the trade tensions that have impacted the global economy.</p>

The article points to CBS News installing a Trump ally as ombudsman shortly after a Trump-friendly billionaire's family gained control of its parent company, Paramount. Furthermore, reports suggest Paramount may seek to acquire CNN's parent company and that the Murdoch family has settled a feud, ensuring Fox News remains conservative for decades.

          <p>The recent assassination of Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus has brought intense scrutiny to a state law that permits concealed-carry permit holders to have firearms at colleges. The law, passed in August, added to Utah's already permissive gun legislation, which includes permitless carry and a lack of "red flag" laws. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle is unclear, the shooting has reignited the debate over the effectiveness of such laws. Proponents argue they deter crime, but critics contend they are inadequate against politically motivated violence and create new safety risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is reportedly increasing the stress and workload for parents trying to provide healthy food for their children. The movement condemns a long list of ingredients like seed oils and processed foods, forcing parents into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits to meet its strict, and sometimes unscientific, standards. Critics argue that while the campaign raises awareness, it offers little practical support, especially as the administration has cut funding for food assistance programs, compounding the burden on families.</p>

          <p>Amid declining popularity for the UK's Labour government, political analysts are looking to the success of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive Democratic mayoral candidate in New York, for potential lessons. Mamdani's people-powered campaign has resonated with voters through a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, housing, and a higher minimum wage. Experts suggest Labour could learn from his strategy of championing clear, compelling policies and crafting an overarching narrative that picks a side and connects with voters' lived experiences. His savvy use of social media is also highlighted as a key factor.</p>

The surgical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, drove through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then successfully completed the transplant surgery as the hospital building shook from nearby blasts. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering and has a chance for a full life.</p>

The statement comes after Mandelson was sacked from the post following the publication of emails showing his supportive messages to Epstein in 2008. A UK cabinet member acknowledged that Mandelson's appointment was "highly unlikely" had the full extent of his ties to Epstein been known.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being viewed as a potential watershed moment in a period of rising political violence in the United States. Data shows a nearly 40% increase in terrorism and targeted violence plots in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. Experts draw parallels to the 1960s but warn that modern social media and the availability of lethal weapons make the current era more dangerous. The assassination has prompted fears of retribution and further polarization, with Utah's governor questioning whether it marks the "beginning of a darker chapter" for the nation.</p>
