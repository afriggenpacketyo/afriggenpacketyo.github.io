          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to cool, with official figures showing a notable drop in vacancies and a decrease in the number of payrolled employees. Between May and July, job openings fell by 5.8% to 718,000 across most sectors, suggesting some companies are slowing recruitment or not replacing departing staff. While the slowdown indicates a gradual cooling rather than a sharp downturn, sectors like hospitality and retail have seen the steepest declines. Despite these trends, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of anticompetitive behavior related to the App Store rankings of his AI chatbot, Grok. Musk alleges that Apple is making it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, calling it an "unequivocal antitrust violation." The threat follows Musk's criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, which he previously labeled an "unacceptable security violation." This adds to existing antitrust challenges against Apple, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice.</p>

With the exception of Hungary's Viktor Orban, 26 EU leaders signed a statement emphasizing that any peace deal must respect international law and Ukraine's territorial integrity. The appeal reflects widespread European concern that Trump might broker a deal involving territorial concessions to Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have reported recapturing two more villages in the eastern Sumy region amid ongoing fighting.</p>

The move provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the U.S. terms "unfair trade practices." Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its current 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year, with bilateral trade down compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023. Alongside the rate cut, the central bank also downgraded its annual economic growth forecast for the country from 2.1% to 1.7%. The RBA cited a substantial drop in inflation and weaker-than-expected public demand as key factors in its decision. The move comes amid a challenging global trade environment and softer domestic economic performance, with analysts now forecasting potential for further rate cuts later in the year.

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia, including the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef, have experienced their worst bleaching event ever recorded. The damage was caused by the state's "longest, largest and most intense" marine heatwave, which subjected the reefs to severe heat stress for extended periods. This event is part of a two-year global coral bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science noted that even reefs previously considered resilient have been severely impacted, highlighting the escalating threat of climate change.</p>

An Israel Democracy Institute poll found that 79% of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by reports of famine and hardship in Gaza. This highlights a public focus centered on the return of hostages and the safety of Israeli soldiers, rather than the humanitarian cost of the war on the Palestinian population.</p>

          <p>Thousands of North Koreans are allegedly being sent to work in Russia under exploitative, "slave-like" conditions to address labor shortages exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. According to interviews with escaped workers and South Korean intelligence, these laborers face grueling 18-hour workdays on construction sites with minimal safety and pay. Most of their earnings are reportedly confiscated by the North Korean state as "loyalty fees." This practice appears to violate a 2019 UN ban on the use of North Korean labor, with Russia allegedly using student visas to bypass sanctions and potentially dispatching over 50,000 workers.</p>

          <p>Spain is charting a foreign policy course that is creating tensions with the Trump administration, notably by resisting pressure to meet NATO's new 5% defense spending target and pursuing closer economic ties with China. The Spanish government recently opted for European military aircraft over U.S.-made F-35s, drawing criticism from President Trump. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government may be using these foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues. Despite Trump's threats of trade repercussions, Spain has so far been shielded from direct tariffs due to its membership in the European Union, which negotiates trade deals collectively.</p>

Concerns were first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014, but the component was not recalled from the UK market until 2022.

          <p>Victor Martinez-Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2023 murder of Rachel Morin. Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was sexually assaulted and killed on a hiking trail in Maryland. The case gained national attention after President Donald Trump cited it as justification for his border security policies. Martinez-Hernandez, who was also wanted for a murder in El Salvador, had illegally entered the U.S. multiple times. Morin's family provided emotional victim impact statements before the sentence was delivered.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, has gone on trial in Utah. He is accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2008, one of two separate cases against him. The court heard testimony from the alleged victim, who described how Rossi became controlling before he allegedly held her down and assaulted her. Rossi was arrested in Glasgow in 2021 after being hospitalized with COVID-19, where staff recognized his tattoos from an Interpol notice. He had been living in the UK under the alias "Arthur Knight."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to have the plaintiffs fired from a $240 million luxury housing development they had conceived and initiated. The plaintiffs claim they brought Ohtani into the project for his promotional value, but his agent made increasing demands before insisting their business partner terminate them. The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, seeking accountability for their alleged misconduct.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub faces a wave of new competition from startups in the rapidly growing AI-powered coding tool market. While GitHub's Copilot was an early leader in the space, newer tools like Cursor and Claude Code are gaining traction among developers. Dohmke will remain until the end of the year to manage the transition, with top GitHub executives set to report to an executive in Microsoft's CoreAI group in the interim.</p>

This incident is the third major event at the aging facility in 2025, raising further concerns about safety and pollution.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data collection. Trump stated the move would ensure the numbers released by the agency are "HONEST and ACCURATE," while critics have raised concerns that the firing and new appointment could undermine the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for a balanced approach to regulating the country's fiercely competitive "quick commerce" sector. He argued that instead of stifling competition, the government should focus on curbing excessive and unsustainable cash-burning practices by companies. Wang emphasized that the rapid delivery sector creates new consumption opportunities that are vital for long-term growth. His recommendation is to guide the industry's development towards a more sustainable model based on innovation and quality, rather than a zero-sum battle for market share.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl is recovering in the hospital after being attacked by a mountain lion outside her family's home in Malibu on Sunday night. The girl was doing chores in the backyard when the attack occurred, and her mother and sibling rushed out after hearing screams, scaring the animal away. The girl sustained injuries to her arm, leg, and back. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located the mountain lion in nearby brush on the property and killed it.

          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its less-developed western provinces, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan mountains for the next two years. This move is intended to draw mountaineers to more remote areas and stimulate local economies. The initiative contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for climbing Mount Everest during peak season to $15,000, the first hike in nearly a decade. The 97 fee-free peaks, which have historically seen very little climbing traffic, could also serve as training grounds for new regulations requiring Everest climbers to have prior experience.</p>

The suspects led authorities on a chase, during which they abandoned the truck and stole a big rig, driving it the wrong way on the 10 Freeway. After ditching the semi-truck in downtown L.A., they carjacked a third vehicle, a Chevrolet Silverado. The suspects eventually abandoned the final truck and managed to escape on foot.

          <p>President Donald Trump has made the extraordinary move of seizing control of Washington D.C.'s metropolitan police force and deploying the National Guard to the capital, bypassing the city's elected officials. Trump claimed the action was necessary to "rescue" the city from lawlessness and "get rid of the slums," though critics argue his portrayal of crime is based on false claims. The move was condemned by D.C. officials as illegal and sparked protests outside the White House. Trump also warned that other Democrat-led cities could face similar federal intervention if they do not address crime.</p>

It has been deployed in numerous conflict zones by countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Domestically, a variant known as the GJ-2 serves as a backbone of the People's Liberation Army's uncrewed capabilities, often compared to the American MQ-9 Reaper drone in its design and function.</p>
