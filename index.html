          <p>After a month-long trial in Paris, eight of the ten individuals accused of robbing Kim Kardashian of millions of dollars in jewelry in 2016 were found guilty. The ringleader, Aomar A√Øt Khedache, received the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment, with five years suspended. Kardashian testified emotionally about the ordeal, stating she feared for her life during the robbery, which involved being bound and locked in a bathroom while the robbers searched for her expensive jewelry. Khedache and another accomplice apologized to Kardashian and the court before the convictions were announced. </p>

          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial election is shaping up to be a closely watched race, with primaries approaching and experts suggesting it could be a bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections. The race features a crowded field of Democratic candidates vying to succeed the term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, including U.S. Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Republicans are hoping to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on Trump over the years. Issues such as immigration, housing affordability, and Trump's influence are central to the campaigns. </p>

The lawsuit accused the administration of a "campaign of retribution" after Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification was revoked, halting the university's ability to enroll international students. A federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against the federal edict, agreeing that its implementation would cause ‚Äúimmediate and irreparable injury‚Äù to the university.

This bill could bring vouchers to liberal states and is expected to reach as many as 1 million students nationwide, with much of the money going to religious education.

          <p>California Assemblymember Catherine Stefani has introduced Assembly Bill 381, aimed at preventing human trafficking and forced labor. The bill seeks to ensure California does not ignore the human suffering behind the products it buys with public funds, as the state spends nearly $19 billion on items like uniforms and cleaning products, some of which may come from companies using forced labor. AB 381 would update California's rules to match federal laws against human trafficking, requiring companies doing business with the state to have a plan to stop trafficking, train their workers, and ensure their subcontractors do the same. The bill would modify existing California law to align with federal anti-trafficking measures, and aims to ensure companies doing business with the state follow basic and sensible measures to prevent the exploitation of workers. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing stalled trade negotiations. The move follows complaints that the EU has been "very difficult to deal with" and that discussions are "going nowhere." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that the announcement would "light a fire under the EU." The EU was the second-largest purchaser of U.S. exports in 2022, taking in nearly $351 billion in American goods. </p>

          <p>President Trump has again taken aim at Apple, expressing frustration that the company produces iPhones in other parts of Asia. Trump stated that he expects iPhones sold in the United States to be manufactured and built in the United States, not India or elsewhere, or face a tariff of at least 25%. Analysts have dismissed the feasibility of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S., citing the cost and time required. In the June quarter, Apple expects to source the majority of iPhones sold in the United States from India. </p>

TJX has a vast network of over 21,000 vendors across more than 100 countries, enabling it to source products at the best possible prices.

Nadig advises investors to do more homework on what's out there, as the new funds will lead to an "enormous burden on individual investors and advisors to wade through that stuff." Most of the new products are expected to be traditional asset allocation products, but investors should be wary of the history of active managers failing to beat the index.
