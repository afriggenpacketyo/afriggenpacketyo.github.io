          <p>Following a strong preseason debut for the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders publicly confronted an ESPN reporter, questioning his consistently negative coverage. The interaction, captured on video, was sarcastic but ended with a laugh, highlighting the intense media scrutiny surrounding the high-profile player. Despite the reporter's past critiques, he acknowledged Sanders' "outstanding" performance after the game, signaling a potential shift in the narrative as the Browns' quarterback competition intensifies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has dramatically shifted over the decades, moving from a scenic, romantic backdrop in post-independence films to a militarized and conflicted region. This change was catalyzed by the rise of insurgency in the late 1980s, leading to films that intertwined themes of patriotism, conflict, and national security. In recent years, particularly after the 2019 abrogation of Article 370, films like "The Kashmir Files" have reflected a more government-aligned narrative, sparking debate over their one-sided portrayals.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, following a similar move by the South to de-escalate tensions. The South had recently halted its anti-Pyongyang broadcasts, which included K-pop music and critical messages, as a goodwill gesture from its new liberal government. This reciprocal action marks a potential, albeit fragile, reduction in the Cold War-style psychological warfare that has recently intensified between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies any conspiracy against her predecessor, Alex Salmond, and accuses him of trying to destroy the Scottish National Party. She recounts her shock at the sexual misconduct allegations against him and claims he wanted her to improperly halt the government's investigation. Sturgeon describes the breakdown of their political partnership as "mortal political combat," asserting that Salmond fabricated a conspiracy narrative because he was unwilling to honestly reflect on his own behavior.</p>

The fire, which started Thursday, led to the serious injury of a Kern County Fire Department battalion chief, who was airlifted to a hospital after a vehicle rollover.</p>

Despite grassroots reform efforts, the Supreme Court's 2019 decision deeming partisan gerrymandering a non-justiciable issue has effectively closed the federal path to reform and fueled the current redistricting arms race.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump's business. The move is seen by James's office and supporters as political retribution, part of a "weaponization of the justice system" for successfully suing the Trump Organization. The investigation into James is being led by a U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, escalating the political conflict between the Trump administration and the state's top law enforcement official.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that radioactive water, containing low levels of tritium, leaked into a Scottish loch from the Royal Navy's Coulport nuclear weapons depot. Documents obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle show that the leaks were due to burst pipes resulting from poor maintenance. While the Scottish Environment Protection Agency stated the risk was of "no regulatory concern," it cited "shortfalls in maintenance" at the base, which stores the UK's Trident nuclear warheads.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's push for mid-decade Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas, Democratic leaders are adopting a more aggressive, combative stance. Governors like Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul have threatened retaliatory redistricting, and prominent figures like former Attorney General Eric Holder now advocate for Democrats to "take up arms" in the map-drawing wars. This marks a significant shift from the party's previous "go high" motto, reflecting a belief that democracy is hanging by a thread and requires a more bare-knuckle approach.</p>

This reluctance contrasts with other European nations like Italy and Spain, which have already begun evacuating and treating children, creating a tense debate within Germany about its humanitarian responsibilities.</p>

The plan has been widely condemned by humanitarian agencies, who fear it will cause immense suffering and further complicate aid delivery in a region already facing famine conditions.</p>
