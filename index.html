          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries conducted a marathon speech on the House floor to protest a major Republican-backed spending and tax cut bill. Speaking for over seven hours, Jeffries criticized the legislation as an "immoral document" for its significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). He argued that the bill, championed by the Trump administration, would harm children, seniors, and working-class Americans while primarily benefiting the wealthy. The speech, a procedural tactic known as a "magic minute," aimed to delay the final vote and draw national attention to the bill's controversial provisions.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring all 15 people on board. Three individuals are in critical condition, while others sustained various extremity injuries after the pilot reported engine trouble and attempted an emergency landing. Officials noted the crash resulted in a mass casualty incident but praised the effective emergency response, which was aided by a recent training exercise at the same airport. The specific aircraft involved had previously been in another landing-related incident in 2023, which investigators attributed to pilot error.</p>

          <p>As the 2025-26 academic year approaches, students and families are evaluating whether federal or private loans offer more favorable interest rates. Federal undergraduate loans for the upcoming year are set at a fixed 6.39%, available to all borrowers regardless of credit history. In contrast, private lenders are offering rates as low as 3.2% for applicants with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer, potentially offering significant savings. However, private loan rates can be much higher for those with weaker credit and lack the robust protections, like income-driven repayment plans, that federal loans provide.

          <p>Several conservative House Republicans who initially opposed the Trump administration's major spending bill ultimately voted to advance it after receiving personal assurances from the former president. Lawmakers like Rep. Ralph Norman and Rep. Chip Roy indicated that President Trump promised to address their concerns in the future, particularly regarding clean energy tax credits and permitting rules. Although no immediate changes were made to the bill's text, these promises were enough to secure the necessary votes for its passage. This highlights Trump's continued influence in persuading reluctant members of his party to support his legislative agenda.</p>

This move contradicted the initial conclusions of the FDA's scientific review teams, which had recommended broader approval.

Citing a new CIA report, Wright claims Brennan pushed to include the discredited Steele dossier in the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian election interference against the advice of senior staff. The article asserts Brennan also controlled the assessment's drafting process, rushed its timeline, and ensured its wide distribution to facilitate leaks.

          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated surprising resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and lowering the unemployment rate to 4.1%. These figures surpassed economists' expectations, which had anticipated a slowdown due to the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. Growth was primarily driven by hiring in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. Despite the positive report, concerns remain that the full economic impact of tariffs has yet to be reflected in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent and increases it to $15 million per person, while also raising the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for certain income levels. Another key change expands the tax break for investors in qualified small business stock (QSBS), raising the asset threshold for qualifying companies and increasing the capital gains exclusion.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A) is set to cut its full-time staff by nearly 75%, reducing its workforce from approximately 1,000 to 275 employees. The move has sparked alarm among lawmakers and law enforcement agencies, who warn that it could create dangerous security blind spots during a period of elevated global threats. I&A is the only U.S. intelligence agency mandated to share threat information with state and local partners. Critics argue that weakening the office will undermine the nation's ability to detect and prevent threats from terrorism and transnational crime.</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence from Portugal, a half-century marked by significant development. Since 1975, the country has made remarkable strides in education and healthcare, drastically reducing illiteracy and increasing life expectancy to nearly 75 years, one of the highest in Africa. Despite this progress, challenges like youth unemployment and emigration persist, with many young, educated citizens seeking opportunities abroad. The nation, now considered one of Africa's most stable democracies, continues to focus on social policies to combat poverty and support vulnerable populations.</p>

Luttig argues that Roberts has failed to take a sufficiently strong and direct stand against Trump's repeated attacks on the judiciary and threats against judges. While Roberts has occasionally issued broad defenses of judicial independence, Luttig contends these statements are meaningless without directly condemning the former president's conduct. He believes this silence has damaged the Supreme Court's reputation and is a dereliction of Roberts' duty to protect federal judges.</p>

          <p>The Roman statesman and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero, in his work "De Officiis," argued that true happiness and success are achieved by choosing the virtuous path, even when it is difficult. He contended that there is no conflict between doing good and doing well, as honorable behavior ultimately leads to the most enduring rewards. Cicero's reasoning suggests that actions like dishonesty or disloyalty, while offering short-term gains, degrade one's character and reputation, undermining long-term success. Modern social science supports his claims, showing that virtues like generosity, honesty, and fidelity are strongly correlated with lasting life satisfaction.</p>
