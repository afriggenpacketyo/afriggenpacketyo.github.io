          <p>Polish and allied planes were briefly scrambled in Polish airspace early Monday as Russia targeted Ukraine with aerial strikes, according to the Polish armed forces. The Ukrainian air force issued alerts about Russian drones targeting various areas within Ukraine. Poland's military launched available forces, scrambling fighter pairs and elevating ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems to the highest readiness level as a preventative measure. The threat of Russian strikes later diminished, and the Polish and allied warplanes returned to normal activity, with no airspace violations observed. Optimism score is based on the fact that no airspace violations were observed and Polish and allied warplanes returned to normal activity.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops arrived in downtown Los Angeles following President Trump's order in response to violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters, which were triggered by immigration enforcement operations. Protesters clashed with soldiers, resulting in the use of tear gas and non-lethal rounds by the National Guard. Protests have spread throughout L.A. County, escalating to violence after a large-scale operation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE confirmed arrests of individuals, including a "domestic abuser" and a "child rapist," while accusing politicians of dangerous rhetoric and disputing claims of peaceful protests. The presence of the National Guard and continued protests suggest ongoing tensions and potential for further unrest.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK's offshore protected areas.

Sir David Attenborough has warned about the damaging effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed they inhabit.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% in May, marking the sharpest decline since February 2020, according to Wind Information. This decline contributed to an overall slowdown in China's export growth, which rose 4.8% last month, falling short of expectations. The drop in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. China's total trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion, despite the challenges posed by trade tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a strong backlash in response to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops following protests against immigration raids. The administration's promise of "mass deportations" has fueled anger, particularly due to the brutality of federal agents during arrests. Protests erupted after ICE operations, with allegations of arrests without judicial warrants and families being separated. The deployment of the National Guard, bypassing the governor, has further escalated tensions, leading to criticism and calls for Trump to reverse his course.</p>

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating weak domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures. The consumer price index (CPI) declined by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices also dropped significantly. Price wars in the automotive industry and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure on consumer prices. Policymakers are urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption and combat deflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike the initial 2017 ban, this version is broader and expected to withstand legal challenges, though it has drawn criticism for potentially being discriminatory.
