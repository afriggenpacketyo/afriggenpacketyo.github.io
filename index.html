        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, announced that the institution's recent cycle of monetary policy interventions has concluded. He stated that the core task of bringing inflation down from its peak to the 2% target is now considered complete. Going forward, the ECB will remain data-dependent to ensure stability but will not react to minor, isolated inflation fluctuations. This signals a strategic shift after the euro zone's key interest rate was cut from a high of 4% over the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid an intense heatwave in Germany with temperatures expected to reach 40Â°C, education unions are demanding nationwide heat protection regulations for schools. These proposals include providing free drinking water, modernizing buildings, and offering safety training to handle heat-related health issues. Concurrently, German hospitals are requesting additional funding to retrofit facilities, as most lack air-conditioning, posing risks to patients and staff. The calls for action underscore the growing challenges posed by extreme weather, as a wildfire also broke out in Dresden's largest forest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a marathon Senate session for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' Democrats strongly opposed cuts to Medicaid and other social programs. An amendment by Republican Senator Susan Collins to increase funding for rural hospitals failed after most Democrats voted against it, arguing it was insufficient to offset the bill's larger cuts. Collins accused Democrats of hypocrisy for blocking the measure, which would have been paid for by a tax increase on the highest earners. The contentious 'vote-a-rama' process highlights the deep partisan divisions over the legislation's priorities and fiscal impact.</p>

Institutions like Nomura and Citi suggest the legislation would prevent a fiscal contraction by renewing expiring tax cuts and could stimulate business investment. However, this positive outlook is contrasted by sharp criticism from others who highlight its fiscal irresponsibility. The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit, and critics like the Tax Foundation warn of its poorly designed, complicated tax rules.

          <p>A heatwave continues to affect southeastern England, with temperatures forecasted to potentially reach a new high for the year at 34Â°C or 35Â°C.

While other parts of the UK are experiencing cooler, cloudier weather, the heat has been intense enough to declare an official heatwave in some areas.

          <p>This article presents an analysis suggesting President Trump has been emboldened by a series of recent political and judicial victories, leading to more aggressive actions. It cites his pressure on Israel regarding Prime Minister Netanyahu's trial and his successful trade tactics with Canada as examples of his growing confidence. The article also points to Supreme Court rulings that expand executive power and his influence in forcing Senator Thom Tillis to retire after the senator criticized the 'One Big Beautiful Bill.' These events are framed as part of a 'winning streak' that reinforces his assertive approach to governance.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new framework using satellite remote sensing technology to more accurately estimate carbon dioxide emissions from sources like coal power plants. The study suggests this high-precision methodology could provide a standardized way to monitor carbon output globally, addressing a current gap in international carbon accounting. The team noted that their optimized model has significant potential for detecting anomalous emission events and could also be applied to other industrial sources, such as steel plants or oil and gas fields, improving environmental oversight.</p>

This suspension marks another political crisis for the powerful Shinawatra family, which has dominated Thai politics for two decades.

Xi urged party officials to remember that all power is granted by the people and must be wielded with respect for the law and party discipline.

          <p>California's fire season has started intensely, with over a dozen wildfires igniting since Saturday, primarily in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The largest blaze, the Wolf fire near Banning, has grown to over 2,400 acres and forced evacuations, while the nearby Juniper fire has also prompted evacuation orders. Fire officials are battling the blazes in steep, challenging terrain and warn that these events are a prelude to a difficult summer and fall after an unusually dry spring. Crews have achieved partial containment on several fires but remain on high alert across the state.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 charities and NGOs, including Oxfam and Save the Children, is demanding the closure of the Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The organizations state that over 500 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured while seeking aid since the GHF began operations, alleging that Israeli forces 'routinely' open fire on civilians at the militarized distribution sites. In a joint statement, the groups condemned the program for violating humanitarian norms and forcing people into an impossible choice between starvation and the risk of being shot.</p>

          <p>This opinion article discusses the sudden termination of the Financial Fairness Trust by its corporate sponsor, Aberdeen Group plc, as a sign of a concerning shift in corporate attitudes. The trust funded influential research on inequality from prominent institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation. The author argues that this move reflects a broader trend of companies retreating from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles amid political pressure. The abrupt dismissal of the trust's leadership and the potential cancellation of existing grants are presented as evidence of a darkening business climate.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that French cinema has largely failed to confront the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and its broader colonial history. The author notes that French audiences often learn about slavery through American films like '12 Years a Slave' rather than domestic productions. Despite France having the second-largest colonial empire, stories of the 1.38 million people deported in French slave expeditions remain nearly invisible on screen. The article highlights recent, marginally distributed films like 'Fanon' and 'Zion' as rare exceptions that are beginning to address this historical blind spot.</p>

This concept refers to a nation's ability to control its own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure, rather than relying on English-based models from Western companies. Experts suggested that using open-source AI models and democratizing access to cloud computing are key strategies to achieve this.
