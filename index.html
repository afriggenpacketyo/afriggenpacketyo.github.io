          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer delivered a keynote speech at the party's conference in Liverpool, rallying his party and setting out his vision for the country. He primarily targeted Reform UK, framing the upcoming political choice as "renewal or decline" and directly criticizing Nigel Farage. Starmer also addressed migration with "hard truths," acknowledging discomfort within his party while rejecting past approaches. A key policy announcement included scrapping the 50% university target, aiming instead for two-thirds of young people to pursue higher education or "gold standard apprenticeships." The speech emphasized a new form of patriotism and hinted at tough budget decisions ahead.</p>

          <p>Secretary of War Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of military commanders at Quantico, Virginia, advocating for the elimination of "woke" diversity initiatives and a return to stringent combat standards. He declared the Defense Department "dead," replacing it with the "War Department," and asserted that the military's sole mission is preparing for and winning wars. Hegseth introduced ten new directives, including requiring "male level" physical benchmarks for all combat positions and strictly enforcing grooming rules, suggesting those who disagree should resign. This speech signifies a significant cultural shift, emphasizing lethality and traditional military values over contemporary diversity programs.</p>

His wife reported him missing after receiving a worrying text message, and a forced-open window in his 22nd-story room suggests a possible suicide, according to French media. Mthethwa previously served as South Africa's Minister of Police, and his death comes weeks after a Judicial Commission of Inquiry began investigating alleged corruption in the country's criminal justice system. A provincial police commissioner had recently accused Mthethwa of interfering in an investigation during his tenure.</p>

          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown starting October 1 will not impact the monthly Social Security payments for 74 million Americans, as these benefits are funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration (SSA) warns that some services, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards, may be temporarily disrupted. While nearly 90% of SSA employees are considered essential and will continue working, about 6,200 could be furloughed. Additionally, the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement might be delayed if the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index data release is affected by the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of the student loan start-up Frank, was sentenced to over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase during its $175 million acquisition of her company. In March, a jury convicted Javice of bank, wire, and securities fraud for fabricating customer lists, falsely inflating Frank's user base from 300,000 to 4 million. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ordered Javice to forfeit over $22 million and pay more than $287 million in restitution jointly with co-defendant Olivier Amar. Javice, once a Forbes '30 Under 30' honoree, expressed regret for her actions, which JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called a "huge mistake." (not investment advice)</p>

Despite years of investigation, a DNA profile and facial reconstructions yielded no leads until 2023, when forensic genetic genealogy helped link her to descendants.

Although he later expressed regret for his part in the confrontation, he also highlighted the pressure managers face. This suspension will see him miss his side's upcoming UEFA fixture against Eintracht Frankfurt.

          <p>Scientists at Oregon Health & Science University have achieved a significant breakthrough by creating early-stage human embryos using DNA from skin cells, then fertilizing them with sperm. This innovative technique, termed "mitomeiosis," involves placing a skin cell's nucleus into a donor egg stripped of its genetic material, then prompting the egg to discard half its chromosomes. While still requiring refinement and years away from clinical use, this method offers hope for infertile individuals and same-sex couples to have genetically related children. The research, published in Nature Communications, also sparks crucial ethical debates about "designer babies" and potential misuse of genetic material.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown looms, national park leaders and advocates express deep concern that the Trump administration might keep parks open without adequate staffing, risking irreversible damage. Drawing parallels to the 2018-19 shutdown, which saw vandalism, environmental destruction, and overwhelmed rescue services, experts warn that a repeat could be catastrophic, especially during the high-risk autumn wildfire season. With staffing already reduced by nearly a quarter due to budget cuts, parks are under strain, and a shutdown could further furlough workers and halt essential maintenance.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced significant policy shifts to military leaders, aiming to dismantle racial and gender diversity efforts, which he labeled "the woke department." He justified previous firings of generals, including CQ Brown, citing their investment in progressive ideas, and encouraged others who oppose his vision to resign. The directives include reviewing promotion policies to be "colorblind, gender-neutral, merit-based," overhauling inspector general rules to reduce "frivolous complaints," and re-establishing 1990s physical and appearance standards. This article highlights a controversial push to prioritize a "warrior ethos" and risk-taking culture over current diversity and inclusion principles.</p>

          <p>Consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in September, reaching its lowest point since April, as reported by the Conference Board, with a reading of 94.2, below economists' estimates. This decline occurs as Wall Street anticipates a data blackout due to the impending federal government shutdown. The "present situation" index hit a one-year low, reflecting less positive business conditions and a ninth consecutive monthly decline in job availability perception. While the labor market showed slight improvement in job openings for August, overall pessimism about finances increased significantly, indicating growing economic uncertainty and potential challenges for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris defended her unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign at her Los Angeles book event for "107 Days," attributing her loss to the election's unprecedented nature rather than personal responsibility. She highlighted the closeness of the popular vote despite President Trump's electoral college victory and criticized former President Biden's administration for not prioritizing "kitchen table issues" like affordable childcare and paid leave. Harris also expressed deep disappointment with civic and corporate leaders for capitulating to the Trump administration and condemned Trump's use of AI-generated videos.

After stepping down in 2023, Siminoff was motivated by a personal encounter with violence to rejoin, now focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance security. Ring debuted a new feature called Search Party, which uses AI to identify matches in camera footage, initially for lost pets but with potential for broader applications. While acknowledging past controversies regarding police partnerships and privacy, Siminoff emphasizes Ring's role in public safety and its indirect support for law enforcement through user-controlled footage sharing.</p>

          <p>An internal email obtained by NPR reportedly instructs employees within the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to avoid using terms such as "climate change," "decarbonization," and "clean energy." This directive, which the Energy Department denies, extends to websites, internal reports, and public documents, including federal funding opportunities. Critics view this as part of a broader Trump administration effort to suppress information on climate change and undermine federal initiatives addressing its causes. The move follows previous instances where "climate change" was removed from agency websites, further limiting open dialogue and research on environmental issues.</p>

Despite the rising costs, Gregory's Coffee has not yet increased its prices, but anticipates doing so soon to protect its business.
