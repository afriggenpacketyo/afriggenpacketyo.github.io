          <p>The U.S. government shutdown persists as the Senate again failed to pass funding bills, prolonging the impasse. Lawmakers are struggling to reach a consensus, leading to the suspension of non-essential federal services and the furlough of hundreds of thousands of employees. The ongoing political deadlock highlights deep divisions within Congress regarding budgetary priorities and legislative strategy. This continued failure to fund the government has significant implications for public services and the national economy.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced an agreement between Israel and Hamas on the first phase of a peace plan for Gaza, confirmed by Israeli officials, Hamas, and mediator Qatar. This preliminary deal aims to end the two-year conflict, facilitate the release of approximately 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and allow aid into the region. While the agreement signifies a diplomatic breakthrough, contentious issues like demilitarization and Gaza's future governance remain unresolved. The initial steps include an Israeli troop withdrawal to an agreed line and the start of hostage releases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in China has ceased regular updates on its social media accounts, including Chinese platforms, due to the ongoing government shutdown. Posts indicated that updates would resume only after full operations are restored, with exceptions for urgent safety and security information. This cessation of non-essential services, which also affects scheduled passport and visa services as permitted, sparked considerable discussion and ironic commentary among Chinese social media users regarding the American political system. The shutdown has furloughed an estimated 750,000 federal employees without pay.</p>

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard troops from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, sparking a legal battle. Illinois state leaders and Chicago's mayor have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment, arguing there's no crisis warranting their presence. The troops are tasked with establishing security perimeters, crowd control, and de-escalation tactics, though their authority to detain individuals is limited. A federal judge is set to hear arguments on a temporary restraining order against the deployment, which remains a contentious issue regarding federal overreach and state sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has weakened to a tropical storm off Mexico's Pacific coast, though it still carries a risk of flooding for the southwestern U.S. later this week. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, is moving northwest and is expected to further weaken into a remnant low by Friday. Coastal areas of Mexico and Baja California are experiencing high surf and gusty winds, with a tropical storm watch in effect. Portions of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico could see significant rainfall and scattered flash flooding from the storm's remnants.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon Press Association states that negotiations with the Defense Department over new credential restrictions have reached an impasse, with reporters facing policies they believe are designed to stifle a free press. The proposed rules require journalists to acknowledge they won't disclose classified or "controlled unclassified information" not formally authorized for publication, threatening loss of credentials for non-compliance. While a requirement to "agree" with the policy was dropped, reporters are still asked to "understand" rules seen as intimidating sources and potentially exposing journalists to prosecution. The Association also expressed concern over plans to relocate news organizations' dedicated workspaces, further hindering access.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point plan, backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aims to end the Israel-Hamas war, outlining an immediate ceasefire, hostage-prisoner exchange, and phased Israeli troop withdrawal. The proposal details the demilitarization of Gaza under independent monitors and the establishment of a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. It also calls for substantial aid, economic development, and an "International Stabilization Force" for security. While it acknowledges Palestinian statehood as an aspiration, it does not provide a clear roadmap, and Hamas's full response remains pending.</p>

          <p>Access to major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat has been restricted on multiple providers in Afghanistan, according to global internet monitor NetBlocks. This follows the Taliban's previous ban on TikTok in 2022. Users reported complete or intermittent service cuts, requiring VPNs to bypass restrictions, while other platforms like WhatsApp and X reportedly remain functional. Although the Taliban has not officially confirmed the restrictions, this move, along with a recent 48-hour total internet ban, raises concerns among rights groups about its implications for communication and access to information, particularly for women and girls.</p>

          <p>Anxiety is rising in Portland, Oregon, as President Trump continues efforts to deploy the National Guard, despite a federal judge's temporary restraining order blocking such action. Businesses, already struggling since the 2020 pandemic and protests, report further damage from Trump's rhetoric describing Portland as "war-ravaged" and "burning to the ground." The deployment aims to quell protests outside an ICE facility, but local leaders and residents argue there's no justification for federal troops. The legal battle over state sovereignty and the negative perception created by federal rhetoric are deepening the city's challenges and local unease.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning holiday decorating are advised to shop early due to impending shortages and higher prices for Christmas goods, including artificial trees, lights, and wreaths. A major importer, National Tree Company, forecasts limited inventory, down 25%, primarily due to trade war tariffs which have also led to a 10% price increase. The company's CEO, Chris Butler, urges early purchases, noting the peak sales period around Black Friday may see reduced promotions. Supply chain data indicates a significant drop in import volumes compared to previous years, reflecting lower expectations for the Christmas retail season. (not investment advice)</p>

Justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to sue and the broad implications of allowing any candidate to challenge election rules.

          <p>President Donald Trump is slated for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center, his second since April. The White House press secretary stated he would also meet and speak with troops during his visit. This checkup follows a previous comprehensive exam in April that included cognitive and cardiology tests, with his physician declaring him "fully fit" despite a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency. Recent public speculation about a bruise on his hand was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. The president's health has been a subject of public interest, particularly given his age.</p>
