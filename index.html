          <p>China is rapidly advancing its green energy transition, driven by long-term strategic planning and political stability. This includes developing extensive ultra-high-voltage power lines and significantly increasing renewable energy's share in its power grid, aiming for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. This progress is noted by Western media, with some anxiety about contrasting approaches, such as the US focus on fossil fuels. The article highlights China's consistent policy in decarbonization and its substantial investment in clean energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>All Alaska Airlines flights were temporarily grounded nationwide due to an unspecified IT outage, affecting its operations and potentially those of subsidiaries like Hawaiian Airlines and Horizon Air. The exact cause and duration of the disruption remain unclear, though it adds to recent stresses in U.S. air travel, including air traffic controller shortages. This unexpected technical issue caused significant inconvenience for travelers across the country, leading to a temporary ground stop issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities are actively investigating the situation as a developing story.</p>

          <p>Investigators discovered more than 150 DNA, fingerprint, and other traces left by thieves during a multi-million dollar jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum. The items, including a helmet, angle grinders, and gloves, were abandoned by four burglars who made off with €88 million worth of crown jewels. Security footage revealed initial struggles to open display cases and staff retreating, while the museum director acknowledged surveillance blind spots. Despite security failings, public and private cameras have helped track the thieves, with authorities expressing optimism about recovering the stolen items.</p>

          <p>Anthony Boyd, 54, was executed in Alabama by nitrogen gas for a 1993 murder, a method that has drawn significant controversy. Boyd maintained his innocence in his final words, criticizing the justice system. The execution, which appeared to take longer than previous nitrogen gas applications, involved visible shaking and heaving breaths. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a stay, with dissenting justices highlighting "mounting and unbroken evidence" of the method's unconstitutional cruelty. This marks the seventh use of nitrogen gas in Alabama, raising ongoing debates about humane execution practices.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" nature as they contend for the Formula 1 title. With five races remaining, Verstappen is closing in, and Hamilton, having experienced an intense rivalry with him in 2021, advises the McLaren drivers to be equally ruthless. He notes that being the "hunter" (Verstappen) is easier than being the "defender." Despite McLaren having a faster car, consistency from Verstappen and Red Bull poses a significant challenge, making the championship battle highly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is not enough evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. This comes despite President Donald Trump's public calls for the indictment of Schiff, a prominent political opponent. While the investigation is said to be ongoing, Hayes, an experienced prosecutor, reportedly deemed the case weak. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, criticized the "politically-motivated allegations" and expressed hope that the DOJ would conclude the matter.</p>

          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) factories due to a cyber-attack led to a 27% decline in overall UK car production in September, marking the lowest September figures since 1952. JLR, the UK's second-largest car producer, produced no vehicles last month as its IT systems and global manufacturing operations were halted. The cyber-attack is estimated to be the most economically damaging in UK history, costing £1.9 billion. While JLR production is gradually resuming, the incident highlights the vulnerability of industries to cyber threats.</p>

          <p>A cross-party Environmental Audit Committee in the UK has warned that planned airport expansion, potentially adding hundreds of thousands of flights, risks undermining the government's net zero climate goals. The committee found insufficient evidence that the economic benefits of expansion would outweigh its negative environmental impact. While the Department for Transport maintains that expansion must align with climate obligations, the committee noted that technological solutions for aviation decarbonization are not yet commercially viable.
