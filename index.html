          <p>The U.S. Department of Labor has announced it will suspend the release of all economic data, including the crucial monthly nonfarm payrolls report, if a government shutdown occurs. This data blackout would also halt the collection of new information for future reports, such as the consumer price index, a key inflation indicator. The Bureau of Labor Statistics website will not be updated, leaving investors and Federal Reserve policymakers without vital economic insights needed to gauge the economy's direction and inform monetary policy decisions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new partnership between Hertz and Amazon Autos is set to challenge traditional car dealerships by allowing the rental giant to sell its used fleet directly to consumers through Amazon's platform. While Hertz already sells vehicles directly, leveraging Amazon's vast e-commerce infrastructure could significantly amplify its reach and sales volume. Industry analysts worry that because rental companies can purchase cars in bulk at a discount, they can resell them at prices that traditional dealerships cannot match, potentially disrupting a major profit source for dealers.</p>

This high-stakes meeting occurs as Trump expresses growing frustration with the prolonged conflict and its humanitarian toll, signaling a potential shift in U.S. leverage to achieve a resolution.</p>

          <p>At least four people were killed after a suspect drove a vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, and opened fire with an assault rifle. The FBI is investigating the incident, which also involved a fire, as "an act of targeted violence." The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Iraq war veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed after exchanging gunfire with police. The attack has prompted school closures and increased patrols around places of worship in the area.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure revealed that a filmmaker's suggestion to digitally alter her neck for a movie flashback scene negatively impacted her mental health, sending her "back to therapy." In a recent podcast episode, the 49-year-old star discussed the immense pressure to maintain a youthful appearance in Hollywood, contrasting it with fan appreciation for her aging naturally. While she has not used Botox or fillers, Bure admitted she is considering them due to the industry standard set by her peers and the visual disparity in how male and female actors age on screen.</p>

Additionally, Cramer described Costco's recent stock decline as an "absurd" situation, presenting a rare opportunity to buy shares in the retail giant at a valuation below 50 times earnings, which he considers a bargain.

          <p>The Canadian government has officially listed the Bishnoi gang, a transnational criminal organization operating from India, as a terrorist entity. This designation allows authorities to freeze the group's assets and prosecute offenses such as financing and recruitment. The move comes after Canadian police alleged that Indian government agents were using the gang to carry out violence and extortion against diaspora communities, particularly targeting supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement. The action is intended to provide law enforcement with more effective tools to combat the group's intimidation tactics in Canada.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Explores Contradiction Between Christian Forgiveness and Trump's Rhetoric of Hate</h2>

          <p>This opinion article contrasts the message of forgiveness from Erika Kirk, widow of slain activist Charlie Kirk, with President Trump's subsequent speech at his memorial where he openly declared "I hate my opponents." The author explores why many evangelical Christians embrace Trump's ethos, suggesting that for a growing "MAGA-fied" segment, politics has filled a void left by faith, providing a sense of purpose and community built on grievance. This political identity, the article argues, deforms Christian teachings of love and mercy, allowing followers to reconcile sincere faith with a political movement fueled by resentment and retribution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections showing a drop from 35 million to 34 million members in 2026. Health insurers are scaling back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to rising medical costs and lower government reimbursement rates. As a result, seniors may face higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for the upcoming year. Insurers are also increasingly cutting broker commissions on less profitable plans, making it harder for beneficiaries to find and enroll in them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in Argentina have announced the discovery of a new dinosaur species, named Joaquinraptor, which lived approximately 70 million years ago. The fossil, found in Patagonia, belongs to the megaraptoran group, known for their large claws and powerful forelimbs. This particular specimen was about 23 feet long and weighed over 2,000 pounds, and interestingly, was found with a crocodile's arm bone in its mouth, offering a rare glimpse into its diet. The discovery adds to the rich fossil record of the region and provides new insights into the ecosystems of the late Cretaceous Period.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his intention to implement significant new tariffs targeting two specific industries: furniture and movies. In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, he stated he would impose a 100% tariff on all films made outside the U.S. and "substantial Tariffs" on any country that does not produce its furniture domestically. Trump claims these measures are necessary to revive the American furniture industry, particularly in North Carolina, and to reclaim the movie-making business he says has been "stolen" by other countries.</p>

Many of those deported, including Hmong and Laotian immigrants, came to the U.S. as children from refugee camps and have since built families and lives in America.

          <p>An analysis of the early Premier League season suggests that none of the top title contenders—Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Chelsea—are without significant weaknesses. Liverpool has appeared defensively vulnerable despite their wins, while Arsenal has shown a concerning tendency to struggle with adversity. Manchester City is still finding its form under a new tactical approach, and Chelsea seems far from a cohesive title-challenging unit. While it is still early, the weekend's results highlighted these emerging patterns, indicating that the race for the title may be defined by which team can resolve its flaws most effectively.</p>

The move reinstates a wide range of crippling restrictions on Iran's weapons trade, oil exports, and international banking access.
