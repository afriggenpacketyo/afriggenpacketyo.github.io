            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of detained Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law invoked by the Trump administration. This act allows the president to detain and deport citizens of "enemy" nations without standard legal processes. The ACLU filed a lawsuit arguing that the detained Venezuelans were not informed of their right to contest the deportation and were given notices in English, despite some only speaking Spanish. The Supreme Court's order prevents removals until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting, raising concerns about due process and potential life sentences in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Recent volatility in the US bond market, triggered by trade tariffs, has raised concerns about investor confidence in the American economy. A sharp rise in bond yields and a fall in bond prices indicate investors are demanding higher returns due to increased uncertainty. This can affect ordinary Americans through higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, potentially slowing economic growth. The situation has drawn comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, prompting speculation about potential intervention by the US Federal Reserve (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has found a model for the repressive state he wants to build in El Salvador, utilizing Nayib Bukele's tactics, including the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), to justify an authoritarian slide. Bukele's visit to Washington DC, where Trump urged him to build more prisons, showcases the internationalization of the 'Bukele method.' Both leaders cultivate fear to address social concerns, but Trump's real innovation has been to outsource the most egregious parts of his immigration crackdown, potentially leaving it beyond the reach of domestic courts. The case of Kilmar Ábrego García illustrates the human cost of this emerging approach.</p>

            <p>Economists are concerned that Donald Trump's escalating trade war and tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, with companies using tariffs as an excuse to raise prices beyond legitimate cost increases. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that corporations might use tariffs to "price-gouge American consumers." The Yale Budget Lab estimates that US consumers could face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, potentially increasing consumer prices by 3%. This could reverse the trend of cooling inflation and negatively impact American households, with rising inflation expectations potentially becoming self-fulfilling (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>China's museums are being tasked with promoting ethnic unity and countering "wrong historical views," according to a directive from the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational historical contexts with ethnic minorities and should emphasize the "China story" through archaeological findings. The goal is to cultivate a "sense of community" and represent China as "diverse but unified," respecting and accommodating differences. This initiative reflects Beijing's efforts to shape historical narratives and promote a unified national identity.</p>
