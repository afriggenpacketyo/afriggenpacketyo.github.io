          <h2>Luxury Brands in China Shift Away From Discounts to Restore Exclusivity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 04:27:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury brands are scaling back on steep discounts in China to rebuild their image of exclusivity and attract wealthy shoppers less affected by economic slowdowns. Data shows that brands like Balenciaga and Versace have significantly reduced or eliminated discounts on platforms like Tmall. This strategic shift focuses on cultivating long-term brand affinity by investing in relevance, desirability, and premium experiences, moving away from short-term revenue gains through heavy discounting. The change reflects a foundational move to foster long-term loyalty among consumers who value exclusivity and brand prestige.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations with a military parade in Red Square, attended by international leaders including China's Xi Jinping, amidst heightened security following Ukrainian strikes. Putin used his speech to connect the war to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, falsely stating that all of Russia supports the "special military operation." A unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia was rejected by Ukraine as a "theatrical show," with both sides accusing each other of violations. The event included a display of military hardware and a tribute to Russia's allies in World War Two, seeking to project an image of global leadership despite Western isolation efforts.</p>

          <h2>China's Trade Dynamics Shift as Exports to Southeast Asia Surge Amid US Tariff Pressures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese government data reveals a significant shift in trade dynamics, with exports to the United States plunging by 21 percent in April while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. This redirection of trade is attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting factories to front-load shipments and leverage existing facilities in ASEAN countries. The data indicates that Chinese factories are taking advantage of tariff pauses in the region to complete orders destined for the United States. Financial regulators in China are prepared to boost domestic demand to mitigate the trade war's impact, as unemployment concerns rise with declining factory orders.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal to reduce or remove tariffs on certain goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum, though President Trump's broader import tariffs remain in place.

The agreement does not change the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but both countries have agreed to work on a digital trade deal.

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following its first-quarter earnings miss. The company reported revenue of $2.24 billion and a profit of $188 million, both falling short of analysts' estimates. SMIC attributed the earnings miss to "production fluctuations" that led to lower average selling prices, with expectations of continued impact in the second quarter. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical changes and government policies.</p>

          <p>Some of Asiaâ€™s wealthiest families are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, citing President Trumpâ€™s tariffs as a source of unpredictability. A family office managing assets for Chinese billionaires exited its U.S. holdings entirely, shifting the funds to Asia. Other wealthy investors are reducing their exposure to U.S. equities and Treasuries due to policy uncertainty and recession risks. This pullback marks a shift from earlier optimism following Trump's election, with Hong Kong and mainland China emerging as key beneficiaries of the reallocation of investments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite sweeping tariffs on imported aluminium imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, the sector isn't moving to the U.S. due to one key reason: high energy costs. Instead, rising costs, particularly skyrocketing electricity prices in the U.S. relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The primary barrier remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, according to the industry. The company was formerly known as Norsk Hydro.</p>

          <p>New soil testing by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health revealed elevated levels of lead and other toxic metals at homesites cleared by federal cleanup crews after January's wildfires. In the Eaton burn scar, 27% of soil samples from scraped areas exceeded California's lead standards, while nearly 44% of samples from unscraped areas had elevated levels. The county is recommending property owners consider soil contamination assessments before rebuilding. These findings add to growing evidence that properties may still harbor dangerous contaminants even after federal cleanup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the cleanup process.</p>
