        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns about the institution's trustworthiness and entanglements with foreign countries. The proclamation invokes the Immigration and Nationality Act, prohibiting entry for at least six months and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing visas. Trump claims Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has discriminated in admissions, and has experienced a rise in crime rates. This action follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was blocked by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has defended his use of an autopen while in office, amid an investigation by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Biden asserted that he made all decisions regarding pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations during his presidency. He dismissed any suggestion that he was not in control as ridiculous and false, maintaining his authority and decision-making capabilities throughout his term. The investigation is ongoing, and further updates are expected as the situation develops.</p>

          <p>The popular Mexican band Los Tucanes de Tijuana has been fined over $36,000 for performing songs that glorified drug cartels during a concert in Chihuahua. Nearly a third of their songs were "narcocorridos" that glamorized drug traffickers, which authorities said glorified crime or alluded to perpetrators of illegal acts. Several states in Mexico have imposed restrictions on this controversial subgenre, and the United States has revoked visas for bands showing images of wanted drug lords. Musicians in Mexico sometimes face cartel violence, with some being kidnapped or killed due to alleged links with rival gangs.</p>

          <p>Amazon One palm scanners are now being used at NYU Langone Health locations, allowing patients to check in by waving their hand over a sensor. While Amazon markets this technology as a convenient alternative to fobs and codes, privacy watchdogs caution about the potential for data collection and misuse. Concerns arise from the fact that Amazon's businesses span from its marketplace to healthcare, making it unclear how engaging with one Amazon-owned entity affects your experience with others. While Amazon denies sharing palm data with third parties, the capabilities are vast, and privacy policies can change, leading to uncertainty about the use of metadata.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's foreign policy is primarily driven by personal and business interests rather than national interest or democratic ideals. The author claims that Trump's actions, such as prioritizing visits to autocratic Saudi Arabia and pursuing trade deals that benefit his family's business, reflect a transactional approach motivated by what's in it for him. The piece suggests that Trump's relationships with foreign leaders are based on personal feelings rather than ideological or national interests, leading to miscalculations and failures in achieving foreign policy goals. Ultimately, the author contends that Trump's focus on "Me, Myself and I" undermines the American brand and creates instability in global affairs.</p>

While most AI experts believe current large language models lack consciousness, researchers are taking seriously the potential for future AI to become conscious and capable of suffering. The article discusses how to test for consciousness in AI, and the challenges of interpreting AI behavior and understanding what consciousness means in computational terms. The author emphasizes the need for technical, social, and philosophical preparation to address the possibility of conscious AI, considering the potential for moral standing and rights.</p>

          <p>A study from Michigan State University finds that the removal of school mask mandates in 2022 contributed to an estimated 21,800 COVID deaths in the U.S. that year.

The author criticizes the promotion of these myths by figures like Jay Bhattacharya, now director of the National Institutes of Health.

          <p>The Glendale City Jail in California is housing immigrants detained by federal agents under a longstanding contract with ICE, making it an outlier in the state's sanctuary policies. The city defends the detentions, stating that the contract is in compliance with state law and involves temporarily housing noncriminal detainees. Advocates, however, believe this arrangement exploits a loophole in state sanctuary laws, raising concerns about the separation of local resources from federal immigration enforcement.

The author argues that Trump's tariffs have increased economic uncertainty and hurt American firms, calling for empowering U.S. workers to adapt to economic changes instead of doubling down on protectionism (not investment advice).</p>

The regulator also warns that weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese. This is because common side-effects of the jabs, such as vomiting and diarrhea, and the fact that they slow the emptying of the stomach, may cause the contraceptive pill not to be absorbed properly. The MHRA has issued its own guidance on contraception and weight-loss injections.</p>
