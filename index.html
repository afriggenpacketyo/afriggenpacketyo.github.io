          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill for England and Wales, incorporating significant changes after its initial passage in November. The updated bill includes amendments such as removing the need for High Court approval for each assisted death request, instead proposing a panel of experts. A recent government impact assessment correction reduced the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. The debate highlights the division within Parliament, with MPs given a free vote on the matter, and various organizations expressing concerns and support for the proposed legislation.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the brink of striking due to a disagreement over pay raises, with the union stating they haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit claims their offer is competitive, but the union disputes this, citing ongoing negotiations and planning picket lines. The potential strike could significantly impact over 300,000 commuters, prompting Governor Murphy to consider declaring a state of emergency. NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate a fraction of daily riders, urging people to work from home if possible.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts and a shift in focus, according to CBS News. The review highlights culture issues, staffing shortages, and coordination challenges with other federal agencies, with concerns that state officials are relying too heavily on FEMA. This comes amid President Trump's plan to reduce FEMA's role and shift more emergency response duties to the states. The agency's new acting leader has expressed support for shrinking FEMA and increasing cost-sharing with states.</p>

          <p>Glen Rogers, a suspected serial killer once linked to the OJ Simpson case, was executed in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs. Rogers had also received a death sentence in California for another murder and was suspected in several other slayings across the country. The execution occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court denied Rogers' final appeals. Rogers' brother had previously raised questions about his possible involvement in the 1994 deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, though authorities dismissed the theory.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly unanimously passed legislation to strengthen penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sexual activity after a period of controversy. The original bill was amended to apply only to offenders more than three years older than the victim. The bill aims to protect children from exploitation and trafficking, with one assemblymember sharing her personal experience as a victim of sexual abuse. Concerns were raised about the potential for the bill to disproportionately affect minorities and the poor due to the criminalization of loitering with intent to buy sex.</p>
