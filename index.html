          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Germany to meet with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting this month, as Ukraine aims to secure funding to expand its domestic arms production. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for approximately $30 billion in annual financing to reach full arms production capacity, highlighting that financial support is the biggest obstacle, not technology or weapon limitations. Seth G. Jones noted that the war's industrial dimension is a proxy war, pitting Ukraine's defense industry aided by Europe and the U.S. against Russia's industry supported by China, Iran, and North Korea. Zelenskyy remains open to negotiations with Putin, including a tri-party format involving Trump, but insists raising the cost of war for the Kremlin is key to achieving peace.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers fell short of required standards when switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. The scandal arose during the cost of living crisis, prompting investigations into British Gas and other firms forcing entry into homes. Ofgem has implemented a new code of practice with stricter conditions for prepayment meter installations, and enforcement investigations continue for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa rejected President Donald Trump's call to arrest Julius Malema for repeatedly chanting "kill the farmer." This comes after Trump showed Ramaphosa a video of Malema chanting the slogan in the White House. Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, defiantly repeated the chant at a rally. Ramaphosa defended his decision by stating that South Africa is a sovereign country with its own laws and that the Constitutional Court had previously ruled the chant as a liberation slogan, not a call to violence.</p>

          <p>Starling Bank reported a 26% drop in annual profit before tax, totaling Â£223.4 million, citing a Â£29 million fine from the FCA for financial crime prevention system failures and issues with Covid-era Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) fraud. Revenue increased by 5% to Â£714 million, a slowdown from the previous year's 50% growth. The BBLS, designed to provide firms with access to cash during the pandemic, had a 100% guarantee to lenders, making the government responsible for covering loan defaults. The Financial Conduct Authority fined the bank over failings related to Starling's financial crime prevention systems.</p>

          <p>Spending from foreign visitors to the U.S. is expected to decrease by $8.5 billion this year, with international arrivals falling by about 9%, according to Oxford Economics. This decline is attributed to negative perceptions linked to trade and immigration policies. The World Travel & Tourism Council estimates that the U.S. economy could lose $12.5 billion in spending from international visitors in 2025, impacting communities and businesses nationwide. The Trump administration's policies on border security and tariffs have created "sentiment-headwinds" among potential travelers, with flight bookings to the U.S. showing a significant year-over-year decrease.</p>

          <p>According to Vanguard research, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income or asset levels. The survey found that individuals with emergency savings report greater improvements in financial well-being, reducing financial anxiety. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasized that being prepared for unexpected expenses is crucial, as the median cost of an emergency is around $2,000. People with emergency savings spend less time worrying about finances and can handle sudden money stressors without incurring penalties from retirement accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Many online fitness influencers promote the idea that high protein intake is essential for muscle growth, often recommending one gram of protein per pound of body weight. However, experts like Stuart Phillips argue that this recommendation is excessive and not supported by evidence. For muscle gain, the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day, and the actual exercise is more important. The author also highlights that protein mania can push people to consume more animal products, which has negative environmental and ethical implications.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at a Bitcoin conference, signaling the Trump administration's growing embrace of the cryptocurrency industry. Vance, a longtime crypto supporter, will join other Trump backers at the event, including Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. The Trump administration's increasing ties to crypto have drawn criticism from Democrats and ethics experts, who argue that Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest. The president's family also has financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino is turning to MLS players to address the USMNT's struggles, seeking players with the right attitude and a winning mentality. With several European-based players absent, Pochettino has called up a mix of longtime mainstays and fresh blood from MLS for the Gold Cup camp. This shift marks a departure from recent USMNT roster-building strategies, which have heavily favored European-based players. Pochettino's decision reflects a search for players who can bring a different level of competitiveness and determination to the team.</p>

          <p>A recent Global Flourishing Study indicates that young people worldwide are not flourishing, challenging the traditional U-shaped happiness curve. The study, which surveyed over 200,000 adults in 23 countries, found that flourishing increases with age in many regions, including the U.S. and Europe. Young people report lower levels of well-being, happiness, and life satisfaction compared to older generations. Researchers suggest that factors such as lack of engagement in group activities, societal emphasis on individualism, and social media may contribute to this decline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Target's sales have declined, at least in part, due to consumer backlash over its reversal of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. After initially committing to racial and ethnic justice in 2020, Target backed down in January, ending its DEI goals and withdrawing from diversity-focused surveys. This decision has led to consumer anger and a significant drop in comparable-store sales. The author argues that Target's experience demonstrates that abandoning principles is not a sure path to material success or public esteem.</p>
