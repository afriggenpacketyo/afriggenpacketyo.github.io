            <p>The Justice Department is facing difficulty in providing requested information about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court ruling ordering the government to facilitate his return. Garcia was deported after being accused of gang ties, which his lawyers deny, and is currently detained in a Salvadoran prison. The DOJ cited an "administrative error" for the deportation but argues the district court lacks jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government. Garcia's attorneys accuse the DOJ of delaying tactics, putting his life at risk, and plan to request to depose Rubio in court to understand what grounds he had to make the determination that Khalil's presence in the US poses a risk to U.S. foreign policy interests.</p>

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests that the U.S. economy is very close to, or already in, a recession. He attributes this to the weakening economy and the uncertainty created by President Trump's tariff policies. Fink noted that consumer and business sentiment has weakened, despite some positive economic data. He also emphasized that "uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations."</p>

A preliminary projection suggests that merchandise trade between the two countries could fall by as much as 80 percent.

This framing commits Beijing to holding out, because the alternative is for a party that predicates its power on the projection of strength to appear to be capitulating to a hostile onslaught.</p>

            <p>President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals could have wide-ranging consequences for drugmakers and American patients, with some experts predicting a disruption in the supply chain, increased drug prices, and exacerbated shortages of critical medicines. Generic drug manufacturers, who account for about 90% of prescriptions, could get squeezed the most by tariffs. Pharmaceutical tariffs could ultimately undermine the government's efforts to rein in the high costs of health care in the U.S. Manufacturers of generic sterile injectables also have limited ability to pass on cost increases due to certain contracts with so-called group purchasing organizations that lock in the prices but not the quantity of what they buy.</p>

The Trump administration had appealed against the district court's order, but now government lawyers must explain to the judge what steps they are taking to return Mr Garcia to Maryland.
