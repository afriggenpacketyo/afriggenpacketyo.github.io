          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated his willingness to engage in talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent meeting with international news agencies. Putin addressed various topics, including the resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and the hostilities between Israel and Iran. He emphasized Russia's openness to dialogue with Germany, despite viewing Germany as not neutral due to its support for Ukraine. Putin reiterated his readiness to meet Zelenskyy for negotiations but asserted that Zelenskyy's term had ended, a claim disputed by Ukraine and its allies, though Putin remains ready for substantive talks on settlement principles. The Russian leader also proposed mediating the conflict between Israel and Iran, suggesting a solution that allows Iran to pursue a peaceful nuclear program while addressing Israeli security concerns. Putin shared Moscow's proposals with Iran, Israel, and the United States, though Trump has rejected Russian mediation efforts. The situation is delicate, but Putin believes a solution could be found. </p>

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans on Iran but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country and formally join Israel's air campaign, according to sources. Trump is reportedly holding off to see if Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The administration has publicly stated it is not participating in offensive strikes, but has assisted Israel in intercepting Iran's retaliatory missile strikes. Trump stated that he would like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program, but Iran has insisted it will not negotiate under duress. Trump also mentioned the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but is not planning to target him at this time. The situation remains fluid as Trump weighs his options. </p>

          <p>The home of slain Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, where she and her husband were fatally shot, was broken into overnight, according to police. The home had been boarded up after the initial investigation, and family members had already removed items of value. Police say the plywood covering a rear window had been pried off, and the window broken to gain entry. Investigators searched the home again, and family members do not believe anything was missing. Neighbors have expressed outrage and disbelief at the break-in, feeling as if the Hortmans are being attacked again. The man accused in the killings, Vance Boelter, is in custody and facing federal and state murder charges. </p>

Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance in goal sealed the victory. The Panthers' dominant performance silenced Connor McDavid and the Oilers, ending Canada's 31-year Stanley Cup drought.

          <p>Brazil has declared its commercial flocks free of the bird flu virus after a 28-day period without any new outbreaks on commercial farms, according to the country's Ministry of Agriculture. This declaration follows the complete disinfection of the farm where Brazil's only commercial outbreak was detected last month. Several importers, including China, had banned chicken imports from Brazil pending measures to control the disease. Agriculture Minister Carlos Favaro stated that Brazil is working to resume exports with its trading partners, with the World Organization for Animal Health needing to confirm Brazil's disease-free status. Brazil's first outbreak occurred on a chicken breeder farm, where 17,000 birds were culled. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly becoming more comfortable with the idea of striking Iran's nuclear facility, the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The source indicated that it would involve multiple strikes, and there is a movement to prepare for this possibility. The president is engaging with Vice President JD Vance to gauge the reaction of the MAGA base to potential American strikes against Iran. Trump has been briefed on security at U.S. Army bases, given their vulnerability to Iranian retaliation. This consideration comes as Israel discovered they did not eliminate all air defenses in Iran as initially believed, adding to the urgency. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, consistent with its March projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth. The Fed anticipates that inflation will rise to 3% by year-end, with unemployment edging up to 4.5%. (not investment advice) </p>

U.S. officials reviewing applications are told to look for "any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States."

          <p>President Trump and his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, appear to be at odds over how close Iran is to developing a nuclear weapon. Gabbard testified in March that U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran had not resumed its suspended 2003 nuclear weapons program, while Trump stated that Iran was "very close" to a bomb. The disagreement highlights a growing rift within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the U.S. should intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict. Some believe Iran is close to a bomb and support military action, while others argue that evidence is being overstated to justify intervention, citing the 2003 Iraq invasion as a cautionary tale. </p>

Spolin pleaded no contest to misconduct involving eight clients and consented to the stripping of his law license. He promoted false hopes that clients' sentences would be reduced when that was highly unlikely, persuading families to pay fees of up to $30,000 for services with little chance of success. Spolin drew on criminal justice reform laws in 2019 to launch his high-volume firm, using Google search terms and outsourcing work to lawyers in developing countries. Spolin's conduct warranted disbarment, as he failed to act in the best interests of his clients by misleading them and charging unconscionable fees. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not be responsible for the ongoing appeal of President Donald Trump's $83 million defamation case. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers argue in his appeal of columnist E. Jean Carroll's defamation case against him. A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her accusation of sexual assault. DOJ lawyers had argued that since some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, the Justice Department should be able to defend him. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24. </p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold made his Real Madrid debut following his departure from Anfield, adopting his first name on his jersey and speaking Spanish at his unveiling. The full-back had a shaky start, being caught out of position on several occasions. However, he improved as the game progressed, contributing to Real Madrid's goal by intercepting a pass and passing to Gonzalo Garcia, who scored. By the time he was substituted, Alexander-Arnold had played more crosses, entered the final third more often, and had more passes in the final third than any of his teammates. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift in rhetoric regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities has created a rift with his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon contradicts Trump's claim that Iran is on the verge of obtaining one. This disagreement highlights the limits of Trump's approach to appointments, where loyalty and shared grudges against intelligence agencies take precedence over expertise. Trump's desire for displays of strength and his willingness to consider military action against Iran clash with Gabbard's anti-interventionist stance and her skepticism of intelligence that implicates her allies. The situation underscores Trump's tendency to disregard intelligence that complicates his choices. </p>

          <p>Rodney Scott was confirmed by the US Senate as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), despite accusations of orchestrating a "cover-up" regarding the death of Anastasio HernÃ¡ndez Rojas in 2010. Scott's confirmation occurred along party lines, with Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. Scott has expressed support for Trump's desire to build a wall along the border with Mexico and has criticized Joe Biden's immigration policies. A former CBP official accused Scott of unlawfully obtaining HernÃ¡ndez Rojas's medical records during the investigation. In 2021, a report found that Scott was a member of a Facebook group where participants posted offensive content. </p>

The call was initiated by Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. played a significant role in de-escalating tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi. The strident tone of India's statement was likely due to Trump's decision to host Pakistan's chief of Army Staff for lunch at the White House. </p>
