          <p>Following 12 hours of talks in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin announced that details of the US-Russia discussions on the Ukraine conflict will not be publicly released.  While the Kremlin spokesperson described the talks as detailed and complex, the lack of transparency raises concerns about the progress made towards a potential ceasefire or de-escalation of the conflict.
