Decker has been on the run for over two months since his daughters were found dead. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that found some extremely high, undisclosed commissions were unfair to consumers, though it did not outlaw hidden commissions entirely. The FCA will consult on the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The first payouts under the new system are expected next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light. In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play. Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale. It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning.</p>

The firing has drawn criticism from economists, including a former Trump-appointed BLS head, who warn it could undermine public trust in official government statistics and represents a dangerous precedent.

While businesses desire certainty, Canadian officials have emphasized the need for a quality deal over a rushed one.

          <p>The U.S. car market is facing a severe crisis, with a record number of subprime borrowers falling behind on their auto loan payments. Many car owners are now "underwater," owing more on their loans than their vehicles are worth, a situation exacerbated by high interest rates and declining used car values after pandemic-era price spikes. The problem is expected to worsen with new tariffs on imported cars and parts, which could increase vehicle costs and strain consumers further. Experts advise potential buyers to budget carefully and current owners to consider refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left Saturday's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the opening minutes due to an apparent hamstring injury. Messi fell after a challenge and was seen walking off the field before being substituted in the 11th minute. Coach Javier Mascherano confirmed Messi felt a "pull" and will undergo tests to determine the severity of the injury, putting his availability for the team's upcoming matches in doubt. The incident is a significant concern for the club, which has been carefully managing the 38-year-old superstar's workload throughout a packed season.</p>

          <p>A major fire broke out at an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, which Russian officials have attributed to an overnight Ukrainian drone attack. The regional governor reported that drone debris struck a fuel tank, requiring a large-scale firefighting response. The incident is one of several drone strikes Ukraine has allegedly launched against Russian energy infrastructure over the weekend. In retaliation, Russia conducted new bombing raids in southern Ukraine, hitting a key bridge in Kherson and causing casualties in the city of Mykolaiv.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has publicly addressed the contract standoff with star defensive end Micah Parsons, who recently requested a trade on social media. Jones characterized Parsons' comments as typical "negotiation talk" and expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved, drawing parallels to past disputes with other high-profile players. Parsons is entering the final year of his rookie contract and is seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. Despite the public friction, Jones insists an agreement framework is in place and that he expects Parsons to remain with the team.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread anger by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, but not to pray there. Jordan, the site's custodian, called the visit an "unacceptable provocation," and Palestinian groups condemned it as an aggression. The Israeli prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy, despite the minister's actions at one of the Middle East's most sensitive holy sites.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system for launching aircraft. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed what looked like a successful launch, a critical milestone for the new vessel ahead of its expected entry into service this year. Unlike China's previous two carriers, which use a ski-jump style ramp, the Fujian is equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults similar to those on the newest U.S. carriers. This technology will allow it to launch a wider variety of heavier aircraft, significantly boosting its naval aviation capabilities.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump have renewed questions about his mental acuity, as he has exhibited unusual behavior and made a series of bizarre and incorrect statements. During a recent trip, he veered into an unprompted rant against windmills and falsely claimed his uncle knew the Unabomber, a story that is chronologically and factually impossible. Mental health experts note that such instances of confabulation, tangential thinking, and difficulty completing thoughts are concerning. While the White House dismisses these concerns, the pattern of behavior has led some to suggest the president is showing signs of cognitive decline.</p>
