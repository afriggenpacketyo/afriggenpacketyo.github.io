          <p>Brazil's Environment Minister Marina Silva was publicly berated by senators pushing for economic projects that her ministry scrutinizes, revealing the vulnerability of the environmental movement. This occurred after President Lula took the oil industry's side in a dispute over oil exploration near the Amazon and the senate passed a bill weakening Silva's ministry's licensing powers. The senators' actions reflect both ideological opposition and self-interest in advancing projects like roads and oilfields, disregarding environmental concerns. Despite facing these challenges, Silva has vowed to continue defending democracy and the environment, highlighting the contradictions in Lula's promises of zero deforestation and his support for oil drilling in ecologically sensitive areas.

          <p>A proposed US tax on remittances could significantly impact African economies, where these financial transfers often outweigh aid and foreign direct investment. The tax, part of a bill passed by the House of Representatives, would levy a percentage on remittances sent by non-US citizens. Experts warn that this could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid the tax, reducing recorded financial flows. Remittances are crucial for many African families, covering expenses like food, education, and medical care, with some countries heavily reliant on these funds as a percentage of their GDP.
