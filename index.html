          <p>A federal judge in Colorado issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack. Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of attacking demonstrators with Molotov cocktails. The judge cited the potential for irreparable harm if the deportation proceeded without due process, scheduling a hearing for June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the alleged crimes of their relatives violates democratic principles. The family is currently being held in a detention center in Texas while the case proceeds. The ruling ensures the court retains jurisdiction over the matter. The optimism score for this article is low due to the severity of the attack and the family's uncertain situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into former President Joe Biden and his aides, marking the latest effort to promote conspiracy theories and question the legality of Biden's actions while in office. The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what Trump claims was a "conspiracy" to "abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline." The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden â€” including pardons and federal judge appointments â€” and argued "there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name." The investigation seeks to determine whether Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. Trump invoked the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit the entry of noncitizens for at least six months, arguing Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has extensive entanglements with foreign countries, and has discriminated in their admissions practices. The proclamation also directs the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard. This move follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvardâ€™s Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was blocked by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, including pardons. Trump claims this was part of a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and abuse presidential signature power. The order suggests that if Biden's advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen, it would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions. Biden has refuted these claims, stating he made all decisions during his presidency. The investigation will cover which executive actions used an autopen and who directed its use, while Trump previously claimed that Biden's alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate.</p>

          <p>Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program are at a standstill as the U.S. and Iran publicly disagree on the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, stating it contradicts Iran's principle of power, while President Trump insists that the agreement will not allow any uranium enrichment. The U.S. has suggested that the interim proposal allows for low-level enrichment while a long-term solution is established. Russia's Vladimir Putin has offered to participate in the discussions to help reach a rapid conclusion, but optimism among U.S. and Iranian officials has waned, with Iran calling the U.S.'s terms unreasonable and ambiguous.</p>

          <p>President Trump barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors unless their entry is deemed in the national interest, also directing the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of current student visa holders. Harvard responded by calling the order an illegal retaliatory step violating the school's First Amendment rights. The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, accusing the school of failing to report disciplinary records and criticizing ties to researchers based in China.</p>

The full ban applies to Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. A partial ban is in effect for Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump linked the ban to the firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado, stating it underscored the dangers posed by foreign visa overstayers, although the suspect in that attack is from Egypt, which is not on the restricted list.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feather fossils found in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in dominating the skies. The research, published in Science Bulletin, examined 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period. The study found that the development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds. While many feathered dinosaurs existed, most lacked the ability to fly, though some could glide or achieve powered flight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has stated that Columbia University has failed to meet accreditation standards due to alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws. The department claims that the Ivy League school tolerated harassment of Jewish students on campus.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon asserted that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria infants encounter after birth can protect them from dangerous infections, potentially halving the risk of hospitalization for lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life and tracked their hospital data for two years. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum, a common early inhabitant of the human body, showed a protective effect, with only 4% of babies with this species needing hospitalization for lung infections. The study suggests that early microbial encounters play a crucial role in immune system development.</p>

Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review.

Republican Senator Josh Hawley stated the review aims to monitor the drug's safety, while experts argue that safety concerns are often based on flawed reports. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review, and medication abortions now account for over half of all abortions in the United States health care system.</p>

Nominal wages increased by 2.3% to 302,453 yen ($2,100), but the rise in inflation offset these gains. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that nominal wages have been increasing for 40 straight months, but the persistent gap between wage growth and inflation is impacting workers' purchasing power. The article highlights the economic challenges faced by Japanese workers due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his criticism of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, urging Americans to tell lawmakers to "kill the bill." Musk claims the bill would increase the US budget deficit and burden citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House defended the bill, asserting it would improve the fiscal trajectory and unleash economic growth. The bill has faced opposition from various wings of the Republican Party. Musk has previously vowed to fund challenges against Republicans who vote against Trump's agenda, hinting at potential political repercussions for those who support the bill.</p>
