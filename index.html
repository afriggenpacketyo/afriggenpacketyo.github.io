          <p>Apple has reported third-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst predictions for both revenue and profit, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. The company's overall revenue grew by 10%, marking its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021 and leading to a rise in its stock price. While Mac and Services divisions also saw strong growth, iPad and wearables sales experienced a decline. Apple also noted a positive reversal in its China market, with sales increasing by 4% after previous quarters of decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American labor activist Chris Smalls, co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union, was allegedly assaulted by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) after they intercepted an aid ship heading to Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the mission, claims IDF soldiers choked and kicked Smalls while he was in custody, an allegation the Israeli foreign ministry denies, calling it a provocation. The incident occurred as the ship, carrying humanitarian supplies, attempted to breach Israel's blockade of Gaza amid a severe hunger crisis in the region.</p>

Despite the positive results, Amazon's shares fell in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter.

Trump stated that he was upset with Epstein for "stealing" employees, including Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, Giuffre's family questioned whether Trump was aware of the criminal activities of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at the time. The family is calling for answers, emphasizing that survivors of sexual exploitation deserve clarity on the matter.</p>

          <p>A new federal budget bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, includes changes to student loan programs that could make professional degrees less accessible, particularly in California. The article argues that new federal loan limits, capping annual borrowing at $50,000 for professional-school students, will create a significant funding gap for those attending expensive programs like law or medical school. The author suggests that California should create its own state-level loan program to fill this gap, warning that without it, the state could face future shortages of essential professionals like doctors, nurses, and lawyers.

Experts suggest she might focus on a specific cause, such as regulating artificial intelligence, or follow the Obamas' model of creating media content like books and podcasts.

          <p>Coinbase has announced plans to expand its trading app beyond cryptocurrency, intending to create an "everything exchange" for its users. The new offerings, set to roll out in the U.S. in the coming months, will include tokenized real-world assets like stocks, as well as derivatives and prediction markets. This strategic move aims to position Coinbase as a comprehensive financial services app, placing it in more direct competition with platforms like Robinhood. The expansion aligns with a broader trend of tokenizing traditional assets and follows recent regulatory initiatives to modernize securities rules for crypto-based activities.

          <h2>Researchers Discover Potato Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor</h2>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has revealed the surprising origin of the potato, tracing its ancestry back to an ancient interbreeding event with a tomato species around 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's evolution, but this research shows that a hybridization event was key. An ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that enables the formation of starchy tubers, while a wild potato-like species from Chile contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery solves a long-standing botanical mystery and demonstrates how new species can emerge through hybridization.</p>

          <p>This article presents a historical analysis of the attention economy, arguing that its roots can be traced back to the rise of cheap, daily newspapers in the 19th century. These early newspapers created a constant churn of spectacle and sensation, reshaping how Americans engaged with information and fostering habits of novelty-seeking and skimming. Critics of the era, like Henry David Thoreau, expressed anxieties about the "newspaper-ification" of the American mind, concerns that have been echoed with each subsequent technological innovation. The essay reflects on whether today's AI-driven media landscape represents the endgame of these long-held fears.</p>

          <p>England bowler Josh Tongue delivered a performance that was both erratic and brilliant on the first day of the fifth Test against India, encapsulating his team's mixed fortunes. Despite bowling inconsistently and conceding numerous extra runs, Tongue also produced unplayable deliveries that dismissed key Indian batters, including the in-form Ravindra Jadeja. His unpredictable style seemed to unsettle the opposition, but the overall lack of control from England's depleted pace attack meant they couldn't fully capitalize on favorable bowling conditions. The day ended with the match evenly poised, with India at 204-6.</p>

O'Donnell explained that the book was a passion project born from her realization that she, like many, learned little about the contributions of women during the American Revolution and other key historical periods. The book will feature figures like Mary Katharine Goddard, the printer of the Declaration of Independence, and Emily Warren Roebling, who was instrumental in building the Brooklyn Bridge.
