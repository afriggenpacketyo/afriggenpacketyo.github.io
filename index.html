          <p>Australia is set to become the first country globally to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, a move that will also ease restrictions on blood donations from gay and bisexual men. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Under the new rules, donors will be asked about anal sex with new or multiple partners, rather than their sexual orientation. This decision aims to reduce stigma and increase the supply of much-needed blood and plasma.</p>

          <p>China is expected to take an active role in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, though analysts caution about the limitations of their influence. As tensions escalate, China has urged its citizens to leave both countries and called for de-escalation. President Xi Jinping has expressed China's readiness to play a constructive role in restoring peace. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which includes Iran, has also condemned Israel's strikes and advocated for peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>As the US security focus shifts towards China, European leaders must strategically leverage NATO to advance their own security objectives. Despite transatlantic tensions, maintaining American involvement remains vital for European security against Russian aggression. However, Europe should prioritize building its defense capabilities and multinational force integration within NATO. This would prepare them to act independently if necessary, particularly in scenarios such as providing security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court considered California's challenge to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in response to immigration protests. Judges indicated they may have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops. The court heard arguments on whether Trump exceeded his authority in invoking Title 10. The deployment has been criticized by California leaders as an unnecessary militarization of the situation.</p>
