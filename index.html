          <p>A large-scale Russian drone attack on Odesa, Ukraine, resulted in injuries to at least three people and damage to apartments, vehicles, an educational establishment, and other civilian infrastructure. Further north, drone attacks on the Kyiv region damaged six houses, four cars, three garages, and three other buildings. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that the Russian attack consisted of 54 drones, with 38 shot down and 16 disabled using electronic jamming, preventing them from reaching their targets. The ongoing conflict continues to impact civilian areas, highlighting the need for continued defense efforts.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing of the tour company owner after the deaths of four people, a court heard how a paddleboarder was "guided to her death" during a tour in hazardous conditions on the River Cleddau in 2021. The owner, Nerys Bethan Lloyd, admitted to manslaughter after four people drowned, and the families of the victims gave emotional testimonies about their loss and anger towards Lloyd. The court heard that Lloyd did not have the correct qualifications to run the tour, and the river was in flood conditions with a visibly strong current. Survivors also spoke of their unbearable pain.</p>

          <p>Gold prices surged to over $3,500 an ounce as President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence rattled investors and fueled demand for safe-haven assets. Trump's pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates caused equity markets to sell off, driving investors towards gold. Central banks' increasing gold reserves also contributed to the rally. UBS analysts suggest gold's performance reflects its role as a hedge amid trade uncertainty, anticipating further upside potential due to investment demand and a volatile macroeconomic environment.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly lowered its growth forecasts for the U.S. and global economies, citing the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the resulting uncertainty. The IMF now projects global growth at 2.8% for this year and 3% for next year, down from previous estimates. U.S. economic growth is expected to be 1.8% this year, a sharp decrease from the earlier forecast of 2.7%.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sharply reduced its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs.

The IMF revised its expectations for headline inflation in advanced economies to 2.5%, with the U.S. inflation outlook also revised higher.

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned to navigate potential tariffs due to its high percentage of U.S.-based production, with 80% of its products made domestically. This domestic exposure gives the company a competitive advantage, as it avoids import tariffs on most of its products, allowing it to maintain prices and profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, enhances its ability to quickly respond to consumer trends. Analysts believe that Bath & Body Works is emerging from a period of constrained revenue due to pandemic-related buying patterns and is poised for more consistent growth.</p>

The government plans to reduce gasoline and diesel fuel prices by 10 yen per liter and kerosene and heavy oil by 5 yen, starting May 22. From July to September, the government will also help curb electricity and gas costs, with details to be decided in May. These measures are in response to rising energy, food, and other imported product costs, which have largely offset gains in nominal wages.</p>

The court determined that crew rests did not qualify as breaks, as attendants were still required to address passenger needs and ensure flight safety.
