          <p>A small Vans RV-10 aircraft crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood, resulting in the deaths of the pilot and a passenger. The plane, which departed from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster and was en route to Camarillo Airport, impacted two two-story, single-family homes, causing fire and structural damage. Residents were safely evacuated from both homes, and no injuries on the ground were reported. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, focusing on the pilot, aircraft, and operating environment, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court found that such schemes undermine the principle of solidarity among member states, as nationality should not be a mere commercial transaction. While Malta claims the program generated significant revenue for charitable causes, critics argue that it cheapens citizenship and raises concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption. The ruling has sparked debate about 'golden visa' programs, which offer residency permits for investments and also pose similar risks to the EU.</p>

          <p>The South Texas facility and launch site of Elon Musk's SpaceX, known as Starbase, has been formally approved as a city following a local vote. The vote, largely supported by SpaceX employees, allows Starbase to operate as an official municipality. While SpaceX officials have not detailed the reasons for seeking city status, it is believed to provide greater control over local infrastructure and operations, including streamlining beach closures during launches. Critics worry about the potential for increased control by Musk and the impact on public access to the nearby Boca Chica Beach and State Park.</p>

          <p>Kenya is facing a severe economic crisis, with increased payroll and excise taxes aimed at raising revenue to pay off staggering foreign debt. These measures have significantly reduced the take-home pay of salaried workers, leading to widespread discontent, as 40% of the population lives in poverty and youth unemployment remains high. The government's efforts to stabilize finances are complicated by corruption and mismanagement, leading to public cynicism about the ability to provide essential services. With limited options to raise revenue and a history of deadly riots in response to tax increases, the country faces a challenging path toward economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has emerged as a significant challenger to Britain's traditional two-party system following substantial gains in recent local elections. The party's success, coupled with increased support for the Liberal Democrats and Greens, highlights a fragmentation of the electorate and growing disenchantment with the Labour and Conservative parties. Reform U.K.'s surge has been fueled by Farage's charismatic leadership and a perception that the main parties have lost touch with working-class voters. This shift could reshape British politics, potentially transforming Reform from a protest party into a major opposition force.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's manufacturing sector is facing significant uncertainty due to President Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from the country, which could reach as high as 46%. This threat is already impacting Vietnam's economic growth, as factories, particularly in the textile and garment industries, operate on thin profit margins. While some factories are increasing production to meet deadlines, others are cutting jobs or freezing hiring as American retailers cancel orders. The Vietnamese government is attempting to negotiate with the Trump administration to avoid the tariffs, but the uncertainty is causing anxiety among workers and factory managers.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's relentless pursuit of justice for their daughter Catina, who was murdered in 1979, has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Catina's former boyfriend was convicted of second-degree murder, her parents, Harriet and Mike Salarno, embarked on a decades-long battle to keep him behind bars, attending numerous parole hearings. Their advocacy led to the creation of Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws, including allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensuring that children must be accompanied by a support person when testifying.</p>

The market surge is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, and the government is promoting domestic coffee beans.

          <p>China is undergoing a transformation as it increasingly embraces a technocratic elite in its government. This shift, where engineers, biologists, and physicists are ascending to leadership positions, signals a move away from traditional political patronage toward a system valuing competence and technical expertise. The trend is particularly evident among the younger cohort of Communist Party officials, with nearly half holding PhDs and many graduating from elite institutions like Tsinghua University. This emphasis on technocratic meritocracy is expected to be a significant factor in China's rivalry with the United States.</p>
