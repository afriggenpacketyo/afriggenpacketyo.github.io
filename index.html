        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., leading the White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, released its first report identifying poor diet, chemical exposure, inactivity, and overmedicalization as key drivers of childhood chronic diseases. The report, a collaborative effort involving multiple agencies, emphasizes the urgency of addressing issues like obesity, diabetes, autism, and ADHD. While the report echoes many of Kennedy's long-held views, including criticism of ultra-processed foods and the federal dietary guidelines, it also acknowledges the pharmaceutical industry's First Amendment rights regarding advertising. Critics argue the report misrepresents facts and omits well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease, such as maternal health and preterm birth.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant drop after House Republicans passed a tax bill terminating key clean energy credits. Sunrun, a residential solar installer, plummeted due to the legislation ending tax credits for companies that lease equipment to customers. Analysts at Jefferies described the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, while Guggenheim noted that it would be disastrous for companies like Sunrun, as lease arrangements account for approximately 70% of the rooftop solar industry. Despite the bill's negative impact on the solar sector, Jefferies anticipates potential changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Representative Andrew Garbarino, a Republican from New York, missed a crucial vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, because he fell asleep. The bill passed by a single vote, with Garbarino's support potentially changing the outcome. The bill includes a provision to lift the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000, which was a key point of negotiation for blue-state Republicans like Garbarino. Despite missing the vote, Speaker Mike Johnson praised Garbarino's role in the bill's negotiations.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge, investors should be aware of common misconceptions surrounding the precious metal. One myth is that gold prices always rise, but prices can fluctuate and experience dips. Another myth is that inflation always causes gold prices to rise, although gold's price increases in 2025 occurred despite declining inflation rates. Finally, it's not always worth waiting for gold prices to fall to invest, as they tend to rise over time. Understanding these myths can help investors make informed decisions about gold investments.

The testimony is relevant to the governmentâ€™s narrative that Combs used violence as a tool while running a criminal enterprise that engaged in sexual assault and racketeering.

          <p>The White House released a report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlining a vision to "make America healthy again" by addressing chronic diseases in children. The report identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive use of prescription drugs as key factors. While the report calls for new research and improved policies, it also faces criticism for misrepresenting scientific consensus, particularly regarding vaccines. Kennedy emphasized the need for a complex conversation about the nuanced subject, while critics argue that the administration's actions contradict the report's goals due to budget cuts and dismantling of public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) is facing scrutiny over its admissions policies, with the U.S. Department of Education launching an investigation. The investigation follows claims from Virginia's Attorney General, Jason Miyares, that the school's admissions process discriminates against Asian American applicants. The controversy began in 2020 when TJHSST changed its admissions policies to promote diversity by eliminating standardized testing and implementing a holistic review process. While a federal appeals court upheld the policy, concerns persist over the decline in Asian American admissions following the changes.</p>

Trump played a video falsely claiming rows of crosses marked graves of murdered white farmers; the crosses were actually part of a temporary memorial for a farming couple killed in 2020. Trump also repeated claims about a "white genocide," which lack factual basis, and played footage of individuals singing "Kill the Boer," a controversial anti-apartheid song, misrepresenting them as government officials. Ramaphosa calmly challenged Trump's allegations, emphasizing that the EFF is a minority party and that South Africa opposes violence.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out on the roof of St Michael's Hospital, a maternity hospital in Bristol, prompting the evacuation of pregnant women and babies. The fire, involving solar panels, was extinguished within an hour, and the hospital reopened by 19:00 BST. Mothers-to-be were moved outside, supported by midwives, while some were taken to a nearby building before returning to the hospital. No injuries were reported, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. The hospital's managing director thanked the staff for their work and confirmed that the hospital has reopened.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have been conducting coordinated arrests at immigration courts across the U.S., stirring panic among immigrants. Agents are detaining individuals outside court facilities, leading to concerns that fear of arrest will deter people from attending required appointments. The Trump administration has revived a policy allowing for expedited removals, which fast-tracks deportation proceedings for people in the U.S. for less than two years. Advocates are advising immigrants with upcoming hearings to bring a U.S. citizen family member, friend, or lawyer to their appointments.</p>

          <p>South Africans have expressed disappointment with Donald Trump's treatment of Cyril Ramaphosa during their White House meeting, where Trump repeatedly interrupted Ramaphosa and made unfounded allegations of a "white genocide." Despite Trump's interruptions and airing of a video featuring anti-apartheid songs, Ramaphosa maintained a calm and diplomatic demeanor. The African National Congress (ANC) praised Ramaphosa's conduct, comparing it to Nelson Mandela's diplomatic tradition. Ebrahim Rasool, former South African ambassador to the U.S., noted both anger and admiration for the delegation's unity and diversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican budget bill, passed by the House, introduces nationwide work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose health coverage. Able-bodied adults without children would need to report at least 80 hours of work monthly or risk losing benefits, starting at the end of 2026. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people would lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, with outside projections reaching 14.4 million. The policy's rationale is to encourage employment, but past experiences suggest it may primarily lead to coverage loss due to administrative hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that absent Chinaâ€™s restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>
