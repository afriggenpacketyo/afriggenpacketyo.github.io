            <p>Big tech companies have received a major reprieve from President Trump's trade policies with exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics from tariffs. Experts warned that the tariffs would cause electronic consumer prices to spike. This is happening as the US military is stepping up operations on the Mexico border.
