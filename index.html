          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is highlighted as a foundational piece of American national park architecture. Built in 1904 from thousands of locally sourced logs, it popularized the rustic style that influenced lodges in other parks like Yosemite and Glacier. Despite its age, the inn remains a popular destination, welcoming millions of visitors including presidents and royalty. Meticulous preservation efforts by carpenters aim to maintain its historic character while ensuring its structural integrity, solidifying its status as a living piece of American history.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The emergency ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared to transport the minors from Texas. Attorneys for the children argued the government was attempting to bypass legal protections that allow them to seek humanitarian asylum. The Justice Department contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, but the judge cited the unusual timing and lack of due process in her decision to halt the flights.</p>

          <p>British musician Tom Odell discusses the unexpected turns in his career, including learning that one of his concerts inspired Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell to pursue their own music. After initial success, Odell faced a period of mainstream obscurity before finding a new audience on TikTok, which propelled his song "Black Friday" to global hit status. This resurgence granted him the creative and financial freedom to record his new, more introspective album, "A Wonderful Life." Odell reflects on how personal vulnerability and global uncertainty have shaped his recent work, emphasizing the importance of human connection.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in more than 800 deaths and leaving at least 2,500 people injured. The quake, centered in Kunar province near the Pakistan border, was shallow, which amplified its destructive impact on numerous villages. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but officials fear the death toll will rise as many communities are remote and difficult to access. The disaster exacerbates an already severe humanitarian crisis in the nation, with international aid efforts complicated by the political landscape since the Taliban regained control.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced that the justice secretary will receive the authority to veto new sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council. This legislative change, part of a new Sentencing Bill, aims to increase democratic oversight by requiring both the justice secretary and the head of the judiciary to approve any future guidelines. The move follows a recent controversy where ministers blocked proposed guidance that would have required judges to consider the backgrounds of offenders from certain minority groups before sentencing.

          <p>Liverpool FC has shattered records by spending £415 million in a single transfer window, a significant shift from its previously more conservative approach. This spending spree was enabled by a combination of factors, including accumulated funds from a quiet previous summer, strong commercial growth, and substantial revenue from player sales. The club aimed to capitalize on its recent Premier League title success to attract top talent and evolve the team's style under manager Arne Slot. The tragic death of player Diogo Jota also necessitated unforeseen changes to the team's forward line.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers determined the skull is at least 286,000 years old, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene era. This finding resolves decades of conflicting age estimates and provides crucial context for its place in the human evolutionary tree. The skull's features, distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans, support the theory that it belonged to a more primitive human population, likely Homo heidelbergensis, that coexisted with early Neanderthals in Europe.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp in a deal worth an initial £18.1 million. Lammens arrives on a five-year contract to provide competition in a department where the club has faced challenges, with both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir making errors. Lammens, who has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, is regarded as a major talent with excellent shot-stopping abilities. His signing represents a strategic move by the club to strengthen its goalkeeping options for the long term.</p>

          <p>Costco is now fully enforcing a new policy that reserves the first hour of shopping for its Executive Members. The rule, which grants cardholders of the premium $130 tier access to stores from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays, is now in effect after an initial grace period. On Saturdays, the exclusive window is shortened to 30 minutes. The company stated the change is a reward for its most loyal customers, though the policy has been met with some controversy among its broader membership base. This follows other recent changes, including a switch from Pepsi to Coca-Cola products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine, a major escalation of sanctions has not materialized. Analysts suggest this hesitation is strategic, stemming from two key factors. First, Trump reportedly still hopes to broker a peace deal and take credit for ending the conflict. Second, there are concerns within Washington that completely isolating Russia could push it into a deeper, more formal alliance with China, strengthening Beijing's global position and access to resources. This complex geopolitical calculation has led to a standstill, frustrating Ukrainian officials.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, a Polish CEO, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy at the US Open went viral. The footage showed tennis player Kamil Majchrzak attempting to give his cap to the child before Szczerek intercepted it. In his statement, Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed the player was passing the hat to him but acknowledged his actions were wrong and caused harm. He confirmed he later returned the hat to the boy, and the tennis player has since reunited with the young fan to give him additional merchandise.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has strengthened its squad by signing Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott and Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho on loan. The deal for Elliott, a 22-year-old England Under-21 international, includes a £35 million obligation to buy. Sancho's move provides the 25-year-old with another opportunity to revitalize his Premier League career after previous loan spells. These signings are seen as crucial reinforcements for Villa, who have had a slow start to the season and needed to bolster their attacking options before the transfer window closed.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has stated he would "declare a republic in arms" if his country were attacked by U.S. forces deployed in the Caribbean. Maduro characterized the American naval presence, which Washington says is for counter-narcotics operations, as the "greatest threat" to the continent in a century. The U.S. has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has not ruled out military options, though it has not signaled any imminent invasion. Maduro's government has responded by deploying its own troops and urging citizens to join a civilian militia in preparation for a potential conflict.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has affirmed his confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact widespread tariffs. His statement follows an appeals court ruling that found the tariffs illegal but allowed them to continue pending appeal. Bessent argued that the fentanyl crisis qualifies as a national emergency, justifying the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. He also revealed the administration has a contingency plan, potentially involving the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, should the Supreme Court rule against them. (not investment advice)</p>

The talks occurred just days after the U.S. imposed steep new tariffs on Indian imports as a punitive measure for India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Modi described the relationship with Moscow as "special and privileged," while Putin hailed the decades of friendly ties. This public display of unity underscores a geopolitical realignment as analysts suggest that U.S. trade pressure is pushing India closer to both Russia and China.</p>

The catastrophic flooding displaced thousands and permanently altered neighborhoods like the Ninth Ward. Residents recall the slow and often inequitable recovery process, such as the Road Home program which based payouts on property values, preventing many in low-income areas from rebuilding. Despite the trauma and the slow pace of recovery, many who returned express an unbreakable bond with the city and their communities, having rebuilt their lives and businesses from the ground up.</p>

          <p>In the new film "The Smashing Machine," Dwayne Johnson delivers a transformative performance as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, earning early praise from critics. The movie, directed by Benny Safdie, explores Kerr's personal crisis following his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and his complex relationships. Johnson's portrayal is described as warm, sincere, and admirably ego-less, with subtle prosthetics helping him disappear into the role. This dramatic turn is a significant departure from his action-hero persona and is being viewed as a potential awards contender.</p>
