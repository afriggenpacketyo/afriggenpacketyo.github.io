Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomacy and the return of IAEA inspectors to verify the status of Iran's nuclear material and activities.

GOP leaders are framing the 33-year-old Democratic socialist's win as evidence that the entire Democratic party is embracing radical, out-of-touch policies. While some progressive Democrats have celebrated his victory, moderates have been more cautious, and Mamdani has faced criticism over his past comments on Israel. In response to what they term Islamophobic attacks, several Muslim members of Congress have defended Mamdani and condemned the rhetoric.</p>

          <p>India's Smriti Mandhana scored a brilliant maiden T20 international hundred, leading her team to a dominant 97-run victory against England at Trent Bridge. Mandhana's explosive 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score England has ever conceded in the format. England's response faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt's 66 being the only significant resistance. The result marks England's heaviest-ever T20 defeat by runs and sets a challenging tone for the series.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, has strongly criticized the expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football." He expressed serious fears over player welfare, highlighting the lack of adequate recovery time for players due to an increasingly congested fixture calendar. Klopp argued that the relentless schedule could lead to unprecedented injuries and diminish the quality of the sport. His comments align with concerns previously raised by players' union Fifpro, which has advocated for mandatory off-season breaks.</p>

The march has become a symbol of resistance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government and its broader crackdown on civil liberties.

This event marked a significant milestone, as it was the first time the LRDR's full discrimination capabilities were proven in a live, complex environment.
