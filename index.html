            <p>Premier Li Qiang is pushing for increased domestic demand and market diversification for Chinese exporters to strengthen the economy amidst trade tensions with the U.S. He emphasized responding to external shocks by boosting consumption and expanding the domestic economic cycle, aiming to tap into China's massive market potential. Li Qiang also pledged more support for the property sector, historically a key economic driver. These efforts reflect a shift towards prioritizing internal economic growth to mitigate the impact of the ongoing trade war with the United States.</p>

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts echoed Abdul-Jabbar's sentiments, stressing the need to appreciate the people who shaped the country and lamenting the lack of managerial diversity in baseball.

DOGE withdrew the request after learning the Justice Department had terminated grants to the Vera Institute, which claims it is being targeted for its opposition to Trump's deportation agenda.

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially stall President Trump's AI initiative, dubbed 'Stargate,' which aims to build ultra-powerful data centers across the country, with Texas as the primary location.

Trump allies warn that this legislation could deter investments and push companies to seek more favorable environments in other states, even as China advances in AI technology. While the bill's sponsor claims it supports Trump's agenda, economists aligned with Trump express concerns about the potential impact on Texas's leadership in the AI sector.

            <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump and Elon Musk for allegedly undermining the Social Security Administration, accusing them of attempting to dismantle the federal government. Biden emphasized the importance of Social Security as a "sacred promise" for millions of Americans and condemned the Trump administration's plans for staff reductions and office closures. He also criticized Musk for calling the program a "Ponzi scheme." Biden's remarks mark his first public appearance since leaving office and reflect concerns about the future of Social Security under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>In his first public remarks since leaving office, former President Joe Biden focused on preserving Social Security and urged the nation to overcome its divisions. While not directly naming President Trump, Biden criticized the current administration's actions that he says damage the Social Security Administration. Biden also highlighted his administration's efforts to combat Social Security fraud and dismissed claims about implausibly old people receiving payments. His speech comes as Democrats seek to reorganize after recent election losses, while Trump continues to criticize his predecessor.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans in Southern California are facing a dual crisis: adult birds are being poisoned by a toxic algae bloom, while their offspring are starving due to the incapacitation or death of their parents.

            <p>Nvidia expects to incur a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened U.S. export rules to China, requiring licenses for its H20 AI chip, a popular product in the Chinese market. The restrictions come amid an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, impacting the semiconductor industry. Experts believe the move could be a negotiating tactic, with potential exemptions or changes to tariff policy in the future. If restrictions remain, analysts predict a full decoupling of U.S. and China AI semiconductor supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>
