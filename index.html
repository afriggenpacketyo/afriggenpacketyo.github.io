          <p>Van Badham discusses the current state of masculinity, arguing that Gen X men have failed to adequately guide younger generations, leading to the rise of toxic "manfluencers" like Andrew Tate. She criticizes the obsession with extreme self-optimization and misogyny promoted online, suggesting it reflects a deeper cultural shift towards regressive gender roles. The author urges Gen X men to engage in conversations about manhood and sexuality with their sons, inoculating them against harmful online ideologies. The article highlights the responsibility of older generations in shaping positive male identities.</p>

          <p>The Senate adopted a Republican budget resolution after a marathon voting session, advancing President Trump's agenda. The resolution aims to make Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent, authorize $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts, and raise the debt ceiling. Democrats criticized the plan, arguing that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and increase the national debt, while Republicans defended it as necessary to secure the border, rebuild the economy, and restore peace. The budget now heads to the House for consideration.</p>
