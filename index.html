        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk addressed reporters about his initial 100 days leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), acknowledging the work has been "very intense." Musk noted progress but admitted DOGE hasn't been as effective as he'd hoped, citing entrenched interests hindering their $1 trillion cost-cutting goal. He emphasized the difficulty of changing the federal bureaucracy's spending habits, comparing it to steering a fleet of supertankers. Musk maintained that achieving the cost-cutting target is possible but requires political will to overcome complaints from those resisting change.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board critiques President Trump's first 100 days of his second term, asserting that they have damaged American democracy more than any period since Reconstruction.

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a renowned pottery firm based in Burslem, has ceased trading after more than a century, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors cited rising costs and falling sales as contributing factors, with industry commentators pointing to increased energy costs as a primary driver. The closure marks another blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, known as "The Potteries." Calls for government support have intensified following the closure of several other pottery businesses in recent years.</p>
