          <h2>Psychologist Warns Against Using Comparative Phrases in Relationships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy highlights the damaging effect of using comparative phrases like, "Why can't you be more like [someone else]?" This seemingly innocuous statement can erode a partner's self-worth and create insecurity, as it implies they are inadequate. The article emphasizes that such phrases are often symptoms of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly communicating needs and frustrations. Instead of resorting to comparisons, the article advises partners to express their needs directly and clearly to foster a more secure and emotionally intimate connection. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>A missile fired by the Iran-backed Houthi group in Yemen struck near Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main international airport, causing injuries and temporarily halting flights. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation, stating that Israel has attacked in the past and will attack in the future. The Houthi military spokesperson claimed the airport was "no longer safe for air travel," while Israel's defense minister promised a response seven times stronger. Several airlines cancelled flights to and from the airport, which has since reopened. The optimism score is low due to the missile strike and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers argues that President Trump is exerting undue pressure on universities, particularly Harvard, aiming to undermine academic freedom. Summers views Trump's tactics as "extortion," citing the freezing of research funds and demands regarding diversity policies and anti-Semitism. He acknowledges that Harvard has issues but believes Trump's goal is to break the university rather than reform it. The White House defends its actions, stating it is standing up for students' civil rights.</p>

          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was meant to be an additional proclamation, not a full replacement. This comes a day after Trump's social media post also indicated plans to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing federal holidays or observances requires congressional approval. The article reports on the Trump administration's changing messaging regarding commemorative days.</p>
