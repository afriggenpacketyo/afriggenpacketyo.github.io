        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily roundtrip flights from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its schedule there, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby cited that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers were unavailable after technology failures, making the cuts necessary to protect customers. The airline is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Last year, the FAA moved Newark controllers to Philadelphia to ease congestion, and Kirby praised the Trump administration's infrastructure investment plans. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to allow Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive Social Security Administration records, arguing a lower court's restrictions impede efforts to combat waste and fraud. A federal judge in Maryland imposed strict conditions on DOGE's access, citing privacy law violations and the agency's commitment to protecting personal information. The administration argues the judge overstepped her authority, hindering the modernization of government information systems and the detection of abuse. The Supreme Court has ordered challengers to respond to the administration's application, raising concerns about executive branch overreach and privacy rights.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th birthday and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing of the parade and White House involvement have raised speculation that Trump is using the Army's anniversary to fulfill his desire for a grand military display, which was previously scrapped due to high costs. City officials have expressed concerns about potential infrastructure damage from heavy vehicles and are seeking reimbursement for any necessary repairs.</p>

U.S. Masters Swimming's policy allows transgender swimmers to compete in their identified gender category if they meet certain hormonal therapy requirements.

The cuts come after President Trump directed the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to minimize operations in an effort to reduce unnecessary governmental entities. A federal judge had ordered the reinstatement of RFA's funds, but a D.C. appeals court granted an administrative stay, freezing that order. RFA, which broadcasts in languages like Burmese and Mandarin to reach audiences in repressive societies, is now operating with a skeleton crew.</p>

Experts suggest the White House's approach is politically motivated and could be seen as viewpoint discrimination. While some argue that government funding of public media needs revisiting, others emphasize the importance of local public radio and TV stations, especially in rural communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year seeks to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), along with the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences. The proposal aims to decrease the size of the federal government and reduce unnecessary entities. Democrats have vowed to fight the plan, citing the endowments' support for arts organizations and projects in every congressional district. Despite the proposed elimination, the Trump administration is redirecting some of the endowments' funding to build the National Garden of American Heroes.</p>

          <p>American consumers are expected to face higher prices on small shipments from China as a key loophole on imported goods is eliminated. The de minimis provision, which allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been shut down by the Trump administration. This change will primarily affect consumers who rely on low-cost goods from Chinese retail sites like Shein and Temu. The White House cited deceptive shipping practices and the need to protect small businesses as reasons for ending the exemption.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive information held by the Social Security Administration (SSA). This action comes after a federal district court judge limited DOGE's access due to privacy concerns, stating it violated the Privacy Act. The solicitor general argues that the injunction hinders the executive branch's ability to modernize government systems and combat waste and fraud. The Supreme Court will now consider whether to lift the injunction, raising concerns about the balance between government efficiency and individual privacy rights.</p>
