          <p>Millions of people across the South, from Texas to the Carolinas, are under threat from severe storms this weekend, with potential for damaging winds, large hail, and isolated tornadoes. Torrential rain earlier in Arkansas caused flash flooding, and a severe thunderstorm watch is in effect for parts of the Southeast. The storms follow at least nine reported tornadoes in Texas and Oklahoma on Friday, accompanied by grapefruit-sized hail and winds up to 90 mph. The severe weather threat is expected to continue into Monday, impacting areas from Louisiana to South Carolina, and residents are advised to stay informed and take necessary precautions. The optimism score is related to the author's tone of warning for preparation of a future event. </p>

          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, marking a repeat of their Derby finish. Sovereignty, who skipped the Preakness Stakes, became the first horse to win the Derby and Belmont without running in all three Triple Crown races since 1995. Journalism, the Preakness winner, finished second, and Baeza took third, mirroring the Derby's top three. The Belmont was held at Saratoga due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles, and jockey Junior Alvarado secured his first Belmont Stakes win. The horse race was an exciting event. </p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond discussed plans for the department's operations following the House settlement agreement, which allows schools to pay athletes directly. UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing, maintain Olympic sports programs, and preserve scholarship limits. The revenue sharing arrangements are expected to help narrow the resource gap with other Big Ten schools. The athletic department is also seeking a third-party partner to secure NIL opportunities for athletes. </p>
