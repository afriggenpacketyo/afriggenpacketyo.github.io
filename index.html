          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has acknowledged she underpaid stamp duty on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice regarding complex trust provisions for her family home. She has since contacted tax authorities to settle the outstanding amount and referred herself to the prime minister's standards adviser for investigation. The admission has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who are calling for her dismissal, creating a political challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the move was unlawful. The judge's order stated that the administration used allegations of antisemitism on campus as a "smokescreen" to arbitrarily terminate grants based on political motivations. While the ruling is a victory for Harvard, the judge also noted that the university should have done more to address the issue of antisemitism, which she described as a real problem on campus.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, has resulted in at least 15 fatalities and 18 injuries after a historic funicular streetcar derailed. Preliminary information suggests a safety cable on the "Elevador da Gloria" tram may have broken, causing the car to crash. The city's mayor has declared a three-day mourning period, and national officials have also announced a day of mourning in response to the incident. The crash is currently under investigation by local authorities.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The proposed legislation combines several previous proposals and has garnered support from across the political spectrum, reflecting growing public pressure to address potential conflicts of interest. Supporters argue the measure is crucial for restoring public faith in government, while some opponents claim it could deter experienced individuals from the private sector from seeking public office.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative view of the U.S. economy, with terms like "uncertain" and "struggling" being the most common descriptors. The primary driver for this sentiment remains rising prices, as two-thirds of respondents report that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so. These perceptions are impacting personal financial ratings, particularly for those who feel the direct effects of inflation, and overall economic optimism remains low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a military parade in China, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that Russia is prepared to achieve all of its objectives in Ukraine through military means if a negotiated settlement is not reached. While acknowledging President Trump's efforts to broker peace, Putin questioned the utility of a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reiterated demands for Ukraine to remain outside of NATO. His remarks signal a hardline stance, suggesting that while talks may continue, Russia is not backing down from its core strategic goals in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that U.S. job listings fell to 7.18 million in July. This figure is one of the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic began, coming in below economists' expectations and intensifying fears of a significant cooling in the labor market. The data is being interpreted by some economists as a "turning point" and another sign of a weakening job market, increasing the focus on upcoming weekly jobless claims and the monthly jobs report.

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new all-time high of approximately $3,549 per ounce, marking a significant increase from its value a year ago. This rally is driven by investors seeking a "fear hedge" amid global conflicts, U.S. debt concerns, and general economic uncertainty, making non-interest-bearing assets like gold more attractive. The article notes that while the value of gold holdings, such as bars sold at Costco, has risen substantially, sellers must account for dealer fees and taxes on their gains, which can reduce the final profit.

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have uncovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, a bizarre ankylosaur that lived over 165 million years ago, revealing it was far more armored than previously known. The car-sized herbivore possessed an array of spikes across its body, including meter-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with outward-projecting barbs—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. The discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these complex armor systems, likely used for defense and display, developed much earlier than scientists believed.</p>
