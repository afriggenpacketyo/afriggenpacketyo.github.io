          <p>The article analyzes Donald Trump's foreign policy approach, contrasting his initial promises of deal-making with the current strategic landscape. Despite Trump's boasts of having leverage, the U.S. finds itself in complex situations, particularly with escalating tensions involving Russia and Iran. The author suggests that Trump's approach has not translated into concrete gains and may inadvertently strengthen rivals like Russia and China. Public dissatisfaction with the ruling elite is highlighted as a key factor in understanding American politics and Trump's rise to power. The piece argues that simply possessing power is insufficient without skillful execution in geopolitical strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 hurricane before being downgraded to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center warned of continued heavy rainfall, with the potential for life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, is among the areas facing impacts from Erick, which is expected to produce between 8 to 12 inches of rain in Oaxaca and Guerrero. The storm's wind hazards are categorized on the Saffir-Simpson scale, though water hazards are historically the leading cause of loss of life during hurricanes.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that Iran possesses the capability to produce a nuclear weapon within a couple of weeks, pending a decision from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This statement comes amid ongoing debate over Iran's "breakout timeline" and the potential threat it poses to Israel, the United States, and the world. President Trump is reportedly considering military action against Tehran and will make a decision within two weeks, influenced by potential negotiations and his "instincts." The United States is also in communication with Iran, though it is unclear if U.S. envoys will attend talks between European leaders and the Iranians in Geneva.</p>

Michael "Erik" Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), is at the forefront of military operations as President Trump considers military strikes against Iran's nuclear sites.

He testified before the House Armed Services Committee about increased threats to American service members in the region, citing numerous attacks by Iranian-backed groups.

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with areas implementing these policies seeing up to a 47% reduction in plastic bag waste. The study analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups between 2016 and 2023, finding that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans. California's experience with plastic bag regulations, including a statewide ban with a loophole for thicker plastic bags, highlights the importance of well-designed policies. The research also suggests that plastic bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a decrease in entangled animals in areas with such regulations.</p>

Prosecutors dismissed Kelly's claims as an attempt to promote himself and evade responsibility for his crimes.

Despite Iran's denials, Israel claims to have intelligence indicating a secret program aimed at building nuclear weapons, with Fordo being central to these efforts. Experts believe that destroying the facility would require a U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bomb, a possibility being considered by President Trump. The lack of transparency surrounding Iran's activities at Fordo and its advanced centrifuges have raised concerns among international monitors.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering military action against Iran, particularly targeting the Fordo uranium enrichment facility, citing the risk of weapons production in a short timeframe. He has approved attack plans but is awaiting a final decision, influenced by potential negotiations with Iran. The UK Foreign Secretary is engaging in diplomacy to seek a resolution, while Trump is reviewing intelligence reports indicating Iran's potential to produce bombs. Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.</p>

          <p>The review describes "28 Years Later" as a kooky spectacle with unusual ambition, quirky side characters, and maniacal editing, though tonally ungainly. The film picks up nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, focusing on a community on Lindisfarne, isolated from the world. Spike, a young character, embarks on a coming-of-age journey, but the film's editing and score create an abrasive and confounding experience. The filmmakers suggest that humankind's natural state is struggle and division, with the infected splitting into different sub-species, and the movie challenges the audience to consider who the real savages are.</p>

Fordo, located deep beneath a mountain, is considered a key uranium enrichment site. The MOP, designed to attack deeply buried facilities, can only be carried and deployed by the B-2 Spirit due to its weight. The B-2 Spirit's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets, making it a crucial asset in a potential strike on Iran.</p>
