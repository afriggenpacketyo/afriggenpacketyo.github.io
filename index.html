          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's board has unanimously agreed that Greg Abel will succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure investors by maintaining Buffett's guidance during the transition. Buffett emphasized that Abel will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment, although Buffett will assist with major acquisitions. Despite the announcement and somewhat disappointing earnings, Berkshire shares only slightly declined, reflecting the market's confidence in the company's stability and future leadership.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a decline following OPEC+'s agreement to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, will raise output by an additional 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This decision follows a similar production surge in May and contributes to an oversupplied oil market, exacerbated by concerns over tariffs and potential recession. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production due to the weak price environment, impacting the earnings of major oil companies like Chevron and Exxon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes after criticism that the 100% rate was excessively burdensome for beneficiaries, though experts still warn that even a 50% clawback can cause significant financial strain. Overpayments occur for various reasons, such as unreported changes in circumstances or agency errors, and beneficiaries have a limited time to request a lower rate or waiver. The agency estimates the 100% rate would have generated $7 billion in savings over a decade, but the revised rate aims to balance program savings with individual financial stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are expressing concerns that former President Trump's policies, particularly his trade agenda, could lead to a long-term devaluation of the U.S. dollar. The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is underpinned by America's economic strength and political stability, but Trump's erratic trade policies have shaken investor confidence. The tariffs have increased economic uncertainty, leading to capital flight from the United States, and raised questions about the U.S. government's competence and reliability. A weaker dollar would force the U.S. government to pay higher interest rates and reduce Americans’ living standards, but a viable alternative reserve currency is currently lacking.</p>

          <p>British counterterrorism police have arrested seven Iranian nationals in connection with two separate investigations. Four men were detained under the Terrorism Act for allegedly plotting an attack on an unspecified location, while three others were arrested on suspicion of a national security offense. Authorities are working to determine a motive and whether the suspects are linked to the Iranian state, as MI5 has warned of a growing threat from attackers connected to Tehran. The operations are considered significant counter-state threat and counterterrorism efforts, reflecting the complexity of national security challenges faced by the U.K.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry. He argues that other countries are offering incentives that attract filmmakers away from Hollywood, posing a national security threat. The proposal has sparked uncertainty and criticism, with industry experts questioning how a U.S. film would be defined and warning of potential retaliatory measures from other countries.

          <p>The article argues that Trump's tariffs, while economically unsound, represent an attempt to protect a threatened way of life and address the pain of those who lost out from globalization. However, the tariffs mask more sinister desires, such as tax breaks for the wealthy, and fail to address underlying issues like gutting welfare and rising inequality. The author contends that capitalism needs a democratizing spirit that ensures all people can lead decent lives, rather than a protectivist spirit that benefits some at the expense of others. The rallies of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reflect a desire for this spirit, offering a vision of an America that works for all.</p>

          <p>General Motors has spent the last decade attempting to revive Cadillac as a premier American luxury brand. The plan involves a renewed focus on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the flagship Escalade. Cadillac has been working to isolate its products from GM's other brands, with exclusive interiors and engines. GM President Mark Reuss has been a key figure in this effort, with Cadillac’s domestic sales growing but sales in China falling. The automaker is relaunching the all-electric Celestiq after resolving software issues.</p>

          <p>China is questioning the West's ability to sustain an advanced technological society in the long term, citing its own "strategic stamina" as an advantage. This critique follows China's development of a thorium molten salt reactor, building on research abandoned by the United States. The Chinese engineer behind the project contrasted his team's persistence with the perceived fickleness of Western counterparts. While the technical challenges of molten salt reactors remain significant, China's long-term view and focus on engineering-led innovation pose a civilizational challenge to the West.</p>

          <p>Wally Lamb's novel "The River Is Waiting" follows Corby, a troubled father who accidentally kills his son and is sentenced to prison for involuntary manslaughter. The story explores themes of guilt, remorse, and the challenges of prison life, but the protagonist's narcissistic tendencies and the cliched plot points detract from the overall impact. While Lamb draws on his experience conducting writing workshops in a women's correctional institution, the novel lacks a genuine epiphany and fails to fully engage the reader with the character's emotional journey.</p>

The TV writing landscape is particularly challenging, with roles dropping significantly and entry-level positions becoming scarce.

          <p>The article discusses the historical significance of Lewis W.

The article contrasts the impact of Hine's work with the saturated media landscape of today, where photographs are abundant and often fail to evoke the same level of outrage. It also highlights the role of conservative groups in pushing for the rollback of child labor laws and the potential consequences for vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on their 30 years as a history professor studying California and its people, emphasizing the crucial role of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in making this work possible. Despite being underfunded, the NEH has supported over 70,000 projects, including numerous books, films, and publications of historical figures' papers. The author's own studies of colonial California, funded by the NEH, have contributed to a broader understanding of early America and allowed thousands to trace their ancestry. The NEH's funding, though a small percentage of the federal budget, has had a significant impact on the nation's cultural fabric and is essential for understanding the past and present.</p>
