          <p>A 38-year-old man has been charged with theft of a major artwork after allegedly stealing rare Chinese manuscripts valued at $216,000 from a UCLA library. The Department of Justice claims Jeffery Ying used aliases to check out the centuries-old works and returned convincing forgeries in their place. Authorities found blank manuscripts and fake asset tags in his hotel room, suggesting a sophisticated scheme to replace the originals, which he may have transported to China. If convicted, he faces a potential sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested a 22-year-old Iranian man in Birmingham on suspicion of conspiring to facilitate illegal immigration. The arrest is a direct result of an extensive undercover investigation by the BBC, which exposed a violent gang smuggling people across the English Channel. The BBC's work involved creating fake identities to infiltrate the group's operations in both France and the UK. The investigation was prompted by a tragic incident where five people, including a child, were trampled to death during a chaotic boat launch.</p>

          <p>California's Lieutenant Governor, Eleni Kounalakis, has officially withdrawn from the 2026 race for governor, announcing she will instead run for the position of state treasurer. Kounalakis stated her belief that she can make the greatest impact by focusing on the state's financial future. Her decision alters the landscape of the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited. The move comes shortly after former Vice President Kamala Harris also confirmed she would not be running for governor in this election cycle.</p>

          <p>Universities across the globe, particularly in Australia, Japan, and Europe, are intensifying efforts to recruit students from Southeast Asia to address labor shortages and financial pressures. Countries like Australia and Japan have set ambitious targets to increase their foreign student populations, with a specific focus on this region. European institutions, facing underfunding, also see Southeast Asian students as a key source of income, though they remain underrepresented. This rising demand coincides with a trend of Southeast Asian students increasingly choosing to study closer to home in improving East Asian universities.</p>

          <p>Actor Gina Carano has settled her wrongful termination lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm, which she filed after being fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts. In a statement, Carano expressed that the agreement is the best outcome for all parties and thanked Elon Musk for funding her legal battle. While the financial details remain private, Lucasfilm issued a statement praising Carano's professionalism and respect for her colleagues, even suggesting potential future collaborations. The settlement concludes a high-profile dispute over free speech and corporate accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Footwear company Crocs experienced a significant drop in its share price after revealing a 6.5% decline in North American sales for the second quarter. The company's CEO, Andrew Rees, attributed the slump to a "clear athletic trend" as consumers favor trainers ahead of upcoming major sports events. He also noted that lower-income consumers are being "super cautious" due to cost-of-living pressures and potential impacts from tariffs, leading to reduced store traffic. Despite the US downturn, the brand is seeing strong growth in China through influencer marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

The crew, which includes a former Royal Marine, was actually attempting to row from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research.

          <p>Las Vegas has experienced its sixth straight month of declining visitor numbers, a trend that may indicate broader economic challenges for the U.S. The city saw an 11.3% drop in visitors in June compared to the previous year, with decreases in hotel occupancy and airport traffic. Experts attribute the slowdown to a combination of factors, including reduced international travel, particularly from Canada, and more cautious spending by American consumers amid persistent inflation. Because Las Vegas tourism is often a bellwether, this cooling-off period is being watched closely as a potential signal for the national economy.</p>

          <p>Viktoriia Roshchyna, a 27-year-old Ukrainian journalist, was buried in Kyiv after dying in Russian custody. Roshchyna was captured two years ago while reporting from Russian-occupied territories and died last autumn during a prison transfer. Her body, which was returned to Ukraine in February, showed signs of torture, including broken ribs and missing organs, leading Ukrainian authorities to open a war crime investigation. Roshchyna, who had been honored for her courageous reporting, was posthumously awarded Ukraine's Order of Freedom by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for her selfless dedication.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Israel's decision to approve a military takeover of Gaza City, calling the plan "wrong" and warning it "will only bring more bloodshed." In a firm statement, Starmer urged the Israeli government to reconsider its decision immediately, stating it does nothing to secure the release of hostages. He reiterated the need for a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, and a negotiated diplomatic solution. The condemnation places the UK at odds with the U.S. and aligns it with other international voices calling for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Trump is set to expand the ability of 401(k) fund managers to include private equity investments within retirement portfolios. This move opens the door for average retirement savers to access a class of investments typically reserved for institutional and high-net-worth investors. Proponents argue this could lead to higher returns, while critics raise concerns about the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with private equity. The change could significantly alter the landscape of retirement savings for millions of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite eSwatini being the only African nation to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, a state-owned Chinese enterprise has secured a major infrastructure contract there. PowerChina's subsidiary, Sinohydro, will build the US$146 million Mpakeni Dam, a project funded by the African Development Bank. This move signals Beijing's strategy of using economic engagement to strengthen ties, even with countries that recognize Taiwan. The dam is part of a larger water augmentation project and will significantly boost the nation's irrigation capacity, showcasing China's growing influence on the continent.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn Mosquito Eradication Efforts May Be Misdirected in China's Chikungunya Outbreak</h2>

          <p>Health authorities in southern China are battling a chikungunya fever outbreak, with some penalizing businesses for failing to eliminate mosquito breeding sites. However, experts caution that these broad eradication efforts might be ineffective. The viral disease is primarily transmitted by specific mosquito species, but a University of Hong Kong professor noted that the main vector is rare in the outbreak's center. This suggests that widespread mosquito killing may be missing the primary carriers of the virus, which has been fueled by a hot, humid, and rainy climate.</p>

While the fire is contained, around 2,000 firefighters remain on duty to manage hotspots, and the area will not be declared fully extinguished for several days.

          <p>In the case of convicted Australian murderer Erin Patterson, newly released court documents reveal her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, suspected she had tried to poison him on multiple occasions before the fatal 2023 lunch. He detailed several instances of severe illness after eating food she prepared, including one that left him in a coma. These allegations were suppressed during the trial to avoid prejudicing the jury but can now be reported. Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three relatives with a mushroom-laced meal, which her husband had been invited to but cancelled.</p>
