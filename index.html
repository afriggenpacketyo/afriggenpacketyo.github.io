          <p>Portuguese and German police have initiated a new search in Lagos, Portugal, near where Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, acting on warrants issued by German prosecutors. Christian Brückner, a 48-year-old currently imprisoned in Germany for a sexual assault case, has been identified as the prime suspect since 2020, though he denies involvement. The search, the first in two years, focuses on an area between the Ocean Club resort, where the McCann family stayed, and Brückner's former residence. Madeleine's parents have expressed their unwavering determination to continue the search for their daughter, and the Metropolitan Police continue their investigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the prevalence of shamelessness in politics, using Donald Trump as a prime example of a politician who readily contradicts himself and changes positions. Ross Douthat in the New York Times suggests that Trump's willingness to swerve and backpedal is part of his appeal to swing voters, reassuring them that anything extreme is provisional. The article highlights instances where Trump has shifted his stance on issues like TikTok and the Ukraine war, and it contrasts how his actions would be perceived if done by a Democrat like Joe Biden. The author argues that Trump's political skills and the lack of a strong Democratic national spokesperson contribute to his ability to get away with such behavior.</p>

          <p>Beijing has issued warnings about the escalating price wars among Chinese carmakers, citing concerns about deflationary pressures and the long-term health of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have cautioned that these price wars could lead to reduced investment in research and development, ultimately affecting product quality. The MIIT has vowed to increase governance over competition within the car industry, emphasizing that there are no winners in such conflicts. A commentary in People's Daily described the domestic carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state due to shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its growth forecasts for the U.S. economy, citing President Donald Trump's tariff policies as a major factor. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to 1.6% for this year and 1.5% in 2026, a significant decrease from the OECD's March expectations. The report also notes that global growth is expected to be lower than previously forecast, with the slowdown concentrated in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The OECD's inflation outlook shows a notable difference between the U.S. and some of the world's other major economies, with U.S. inflation potentially nearing 4% by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission's interim findings point to systemic failures in government strategy, regulation, and water company management. The review suggests that new legislation is needed and regulators must have more resources and technology to hold companies accountable. The commission is also considering streamlining the regulators to address the challenges in the water sector.</p>

          <p>Thames Water faces a significant setback as KKR, a US private equity firm, has withdrawn its plans to invest £4bn into the struggling UK water company. This increases the possibility that Thames Water will collapse into a government-supervised administration. The company, serving about a quarter of the UK's population, is now exploring alternative plans with its lenders to raise equity. Sources indicate that the politicization of the water industry served as a major deterrent for KKR, and Thames Water will continue discussions with stakeholders and regulators.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to increase its defense capabilities, including building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and preparing its army for potential conflict in Europe. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced these plans as part of a strategic defense review, aiming to address threats from Russia and send a message to Washington. The measures include increased production of submarines and weapons, investment in cyber command, and the development of new drone technology. This initiative marks a significant shift from the post-Cold War era and aims to create manufacturing jobs while bolstering national security.</p>
