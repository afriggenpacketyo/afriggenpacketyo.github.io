          <p>Following a historic election loss for the Liberal-National coalition in Australia, Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, who represents the moderate faction, aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, especially women and young people, by respecting and reflecting modern Australia. She plans a review of all policies, including nuclear energy and net-zero emissions goals, emphasizing a fresh approach and collaborative decision-making, while Albanese's new cabinet was sworn in, marking significant changes in key portfolios.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift an injunction preventing the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, claiming they are dangerous members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues that these migrants pose a security risk in detention, citing an incident where some threatened to take hostages and injure staff. The administration asserts that the migrants have received adequate notice and opportunity to pursue habeas petitions, while also stating that the majority are eligible for prompt removal under Title 8 authorities.</p>

          <p>The defense in the Karen Read trial is suggesting that Brian Higgins, an ATF agent, may have had a motive to confront or harm John O'Keefe due to jealousy, stemming from flirtatious text messages exchanged with Read prior to O'Keefe's death. Defense attorney Alan Jackson questioned Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik about whether Higgins' romantic communications with Read, followed by seeing her with O'Keefe, could have led to jealousy, while Bukhenik acknowledged the possibility but stated he did not see it. The trial has also revealed scrutiny of state Trooper Michael Proctor's conduct during the initial investigation, including disparaging remarks about Read.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a substantial amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings provide the first seismic evidence of liquid water in the Martian upper crust, influencing our understanding of the planet's water cycle and the potential for habitable environments.</p>

          <p>German companies, long-standing investors in the United States, are reassessing their strategies due to recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook among German manufacturers with U.S. factories. While companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz have engaged in talks to mitigate the impact of tariffs, many firms are opting to keep investments in Germany, encouraged by a new government focused on reducing bureaucracy and investing in infrastructure. The article highlights the discrepancy in investment flows, with German companies investing significantly more in the U.S. than vice versa.</p>

While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei demonstrate innovation, China faces sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Despite these challenges, Chinese tech entrepreneurs express optimism, planning investments in AI and robotics, though they acknowledge that technological advances alone cannot solve China's economic imbalances.

          <p>Australian pension funds, managing A$4.2 trillion, are reconsidering their long-held strategies of investing in U.S. assets and the dollar due to waning confidence in American growth. Volatility from Sino-U.S. trade tensions has prompted a reassessment of U.S. exposure, with the dollar failing to act as a safe haven amid economic policy uncertainty. Currency dealing desks have noted minor changes in hedging demand from some funds, with a reluctance to fully rebalance hedge ratios as U.S. equities fell, indicating a preference for being longer on the Australian dollar. Ben McCaw of MLC Asset Management has been reducing U.S. dollar currency exposure for about three years.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing scrutiny for allegedly blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, raising ethical concerns. Examples include accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family and the involvement with a meme cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, which allows crypto investors to enrich him. The administration has also disbanded a Justice Department unit focused on cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. These actions, combined with pressure on law firms for donations and settlements from media organizations, highlight a pattern of leveraging the president's position for personal gain.</p>

While Pakistan welcomed the offer, India views Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rejects external negotiation, particularly after revoking the region's special status in 2019, and the US Secretary of State announced the two countries have also agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.</p>

          <p>Jacqueline Ma, a former California teacher of the year, has been sentenced to 30 years to life for grooming and sexually assaulting two young boys in her elementary school classroom. Ma manipulated her victims with gifts and special attention, even setting up an unsanctioned after-school program for one of the boys. She pleaded guilty to multiple counts of forcible lewd acts on a child and possession of child sexual abuse material, prompting strong condemnation from the district attorney.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended the plan to use a luxury jet from Qatar as Air Force One, stating that it would be a "very nice gesture" given U.S. support for Qatar's security. The potential value and handling of the plane have raised legal and ethical questions, with some citing the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics, including some of Trump's supporters, have questioned the ethics of accepting the jet, while the White House maintains that any gift is accepted in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Her father, Jose Francisco Arias Tovar, is also being held at the same facility, and both lack criminal records.

          <p>House Republicans have proposed significant restrictions on the federal food stamp program (SNAP), aiming to limit funding and benefits to advance President Trumpâ€™s tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding for food stamps and impose stricter work requirements for beneficiaries, potentially causing millions of low-income families to lose access to aid. Republicans argue their approach will improve the program while controlling costs, but Democrats and anti-poverty groups are likely to oppose the measures.</p>
