          <p>A West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's dismantling of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at the academy. Parsons objected to Trump wearing a Make America Great Again hat while cadets saluted him, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the presidency and personal identity. He stated that West Point began censoring arguments and modifying syllabuses to align with the administration's ideology, calling the changes indoctrination rather than education. Parsons felt professionally betrayed, unable to pursue important questions and viewing the administration's actions as a dangerous intrusion of politics into education.</p>

The race was marked by several crashes, including Scott McLaughlin on the warm-up lap and Marco Andretti on the first lap, as well as a pit road incident involving Robert Shwartzman injuring crew members.

          <p>News analysis suggests the Trump administration has normalized profiting from the presidency to an unprecedented degree, with the Trump family collecting millions through various ventures. These include fees from a new cryptocurrency, overseas real estate deals, and an exclusive Washington club, raising ethical concerns. The acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar for Mr. Trump's use, valued at $200 million, further highlights this trend. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled accountability measures and installed loyalists in key positions, making official investigations unlikely and pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior in Washington.</p>

The attack, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, follows a recent escalation despite ongoing diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones, but the attacks caused widespread devastation, particularly in poorly defended western and southern regions.

Johnson insisted the bill does not cut Medicaid but targets fraud, waste, and abuse, despite analyses showing that many stand to lose coverage under the new requirements. He claimed there are able-bodied workers gaming the system, and requiring them to work would benefit them and the community, though some GOP senators oppose the measures.</p>

This proposal emerged after judges expressed worries that Trump might instruct the marshals to withdraw security from judges ruling against him. The move would involve bringing the US marshals service under the judiciary's direct control, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, rather than Attorney General Pam Bondi. The concerns stem from Trump's attacks on judges and a rise in security threats, including swatting attacks and intimidation tactics.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County sheriff‚Äôs deputy Jim Devoe was arrested on suspicion of felony domestic violence, two years after being arrested and charged with physically abusing his 5-year-old son. Devoe was released on $50,000 bond and faces criminal and internal administrative investigations. In the 2023 case, Devoe pleaded not guilty to child abuse, accused of slapping and punching his son, causing visible injuries and lying to the boy‚Äôs mother. Devoe's lawyer stated they had negotiated a favorable resolution with the District Attorney, expecting felony charges to be dismissed with a plea to a misdemeanor count.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson indicated that there is enough opposition to President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate to potentially halt its progress unless significant changes are made. Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and not adequately addressing spending reduction. The Senate's need for a simple majority to pass the bill through reconciliation is complicated by potential changes that would require another House vote. The speaker emphasized the need to expedite the bill's passage and hoped for the president to sign it by Independence Day.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party is struggling to find a path forward, with approval ratings at historic lows. Communities traditionally supportive of Democrats, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, shifted towards the right in the 2024 election. The party faces challenges including a tarnished image, an increasingly right-leaning country, and structural disadvantages in the Senate and Electoral College. Internal ideological debates are emerging as the party grapples with how to rebuild and connect with voters, with some calling for more action and less self-reflection.</p>

          <p>A second major power outage in two days struck southeastern France, this time in Nice, after an electrical facility was damaged by suspected arson. The mayor of Nice blamed "malicious acts," and a criminal investigation has been opened for "organized arson." The blackout left approximately 45,000 households without electricity and briefly affected Nice C√¥te d'Azur Airport. Police have not yet determined if the incident is linked to a previous power outage that disrupted the Cannes Film Festival, which officials believe was also a targeted criminal act.</p>

The arrest has sparked criticism, and O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs resignation letter cited a lack of departmental support.

          <p>Despite committing to halt fossil fuel funding at the G7 summit in 2022, Japan remains a major public financier of gas and oil projects, investing $93 billion between 2013 and 2024. Simultaneously, Japan leads the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), promoting cooperation on net-zero emissions in Asia, yet many AZEC projects focus on natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage. Critics argue that Japan's investments in LNG, deemed a transitional fuel, undermine its climate pledges and enable "greenwashing." This is particularly evident in Indonesia, where Japan's influence has shaped energy plans to favor gas demand, despite the potential for cheaper and more beneficial renewable energy sources.</p>
