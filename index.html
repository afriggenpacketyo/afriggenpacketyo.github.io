          <p>The Trent Rockets began their season in The Hundred with a decisive six-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix, largely thanks to a formidable bowling performance. New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson was instrumental, taking three wickets for just 20 runs, which restricted the Phoenix to a modest score of 122-6. Despite an early setback with the dismissal of star batsman Joe Root, the Rockets chased the target with ease. Opener Tom Banton's 43 runs anchored the successful run chase, securing the win with 22 balls remaining in the match.</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a narrower second-quarter loss, fueled by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. The company's sales surged 84% year-over-year, and it significantly increased output of the key material used in magnets for electric vehicles and electronics. This positive performance is bolstered by a recent $400 million investment from the U.S. Defense Department, making the government its largest shareholder.

After playing in just 13 of a possible 31 games due to recurring quad and groin injuries, Clark expressed frustration but also noted the new perspective it has given her on understanding her body. Her absence has impacted her performance, including a notable slump in her three-point shooting. The Indiana Fever have had an inconsistent record without her on the court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. mining industry is receiving significant bipartisan federal support to reduce reliance on foreign-sourced critical minerals, particularly from China. A key project is a new nickel processing plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which received a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy and will process ore for electric vehicle batteries. This initiative, supported by both the Biden and Trump administrations, reflects a national security priority to secure domestic supply chains for materials like nickel. The Pentagon is also directly investing in companies like Talon Metals to explore for more domestic mineral resources.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unexpectedly removed IRS Commissioner Billy Long from his position just under two months after the former Missouri congressman was confirmed. The White House did not provide an immediate reason for the sudden ouster, which surprised agency staff. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as acting commissioner for the time being. This leadership change adds to a period of instability for the IRS, which has faced significant staff reductions and is preparing to implement major tax law changes from the new budget.</p>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has intensified as state Democrats once again broke quorum to block a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking the removal of 13 absent Democratic members from office. The Democrats fled the state to prevent the GOP from passing new congressional maps that would favor their party. State Republicans have also suspended direct deposit paychecks for the absent members in an effort to compel their return.</p>

          <p>Legal experts and public defenders are sounding the alarm over the increasing practice of ICE agents making arrests at criminal courthouses, a tactic that has intensified under the Trump administration. Lawyers report that these arrests are creating a chilling effect, discouraging undocumented immigrants, including defendants, victims, and witnesses, from appearing in court. This fear not only impedes individuals' rights to litigate their cases but also obstructs justice by making it harder for prosecutors to pursue cases. Critics argue the practice undermines the judicial system by turning courthouses into sites of fear rather than justice.</p>

Other tactics include walking during phone calls and tidying one's workspace to care for the environment where creativity happens.

This comes as the job market shows signs of wobbling and GDP growth is forecast to slow.

          <p>Several protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct during a demonstration outside a federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Activists gathered to protest what they allege is a covert and inhumane detention facility operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. Demonstrators, who were denied access to the site, claim detainees are held in overcrowded rooms with few amenities. This protest is one of several recent actions demanding transparency and access for officials and journalists to investigate the conditions.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is proving to be a major revenue driver for tech giants, as both Meta and Alphabet reported strong quarterly sales that beat expectations, fueled by AI-powered advertising systems. Meta's CEO noted that AI has brought greater efficiency to its ad platform, contributing to a 22% year-over-year sales increase. In contrast, smaller competitors like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, with Snap struggling after a botched ad platform update. The trend suggests that massive AI spending is paying off for the largest players, widening the gap in the digital ad market. (not investment advice)</p>

The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association warned that a 39% U.S. tariff on Swiss exports, which apparently included certain gold bars, could negatively impact the global flow of physical gold. President Trump's tariff policies had created uncertainty in the market, causing the price spike. Following the White House statement, gold prices pulled back from their record-setting levels.

          <p>A billboard banner has appeared on a freeway in Corona, California, stating "Proud Boys Love Sydney Sweeney," using the neo-fascist group's signature colors. The banner references a controversial American Eagle ad campaign in which the actor's 'jeans' were punned with 'genes,' drawing allegations of promoting eugenics. The ad and Sweeney's Republican voter registration previously earned praise from President Trump. This latest development links the actor to the far-right group, which Trump famously told to "stand back and stand by," though it is unclear who is responsible for the banner.</p>

July saw the second-highest monthly EV sales on record, with their market share reaching an all-time high of 9.1% of total passenger vehicle sales. The tax credit, which was part of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act but is being ended by the Trump administration, has been crucial in bringing EVs closer to price parity.
