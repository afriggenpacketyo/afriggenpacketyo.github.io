          <h2>Germany Considers Quota System for Immigrant Students in Schools</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 03:18:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German education minister's proposal to limit the number of immigrant students in schools to around 30-40% has sparked a significant national debate. Proponents, including the German Teachers' Association, argue it could address language skill gaps, but critics and student bodies condemn the idea as discriminatory and stigmatizing. The discussion highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has seen declining performance in international studies. Many experts suggest that instead of quotas, resources should be focused on early language support in kindergartens to ensure equal opportunities for all children.</p>

          <p>Following large-scale immigration raids at Glass House Farms in Ventura County, families are desperately searching for information on the whereabouts of approximately 200 detained migrants and several arrested protesters. Community organizations and Mexican and Guatemalan consulates are being inundated with calls, but federal agencies like ICE have provided little official information, leaving many to consider their relatives missing. The operation, which also involved the arrest of a university professor, has heightened fear and confusion in the community, with activists criticizing the lack of due process for those detained.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell. The raid, part of a broader immigration crackdown, resulted in the arrest of about 200 undocumented migrants and sparked protests that led to clashes with federal agents.

          <p>This opinion article by Raja Shehadeh contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, a failure now highlighted by Israel's plan to move Gazans into a secured camp in Rafah. The author argues this plan amounts to creating a concentration camp and is a clear crime against humanity, yet the international community's response remains inadequate. Shehadeh reflects on the historical dehumanization of Palestinians since 1948 and asserts that Palestinian resilience, or "sumoud," persists despite immense suffering. The piece concludes that true accountability will come from global conscience recognizing Palestinian humanity, not from a flawed legal system.</p>

The deal underscores South Korea's growing role as a key arms supplier to U.S. allies, who are seeking to replenish stockpiles depleted by support for Ukraine.

          <p>Chinese power bank manufacturers are facing intense scrutiny following several incidents of defective units catching fire on commercial flights. In response, China's civil aviation authority has banned air passengers from carrying power banks that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. The emergency rule, effective since late June, has caused confusion and led to large numbers of portable batteries being abandoned at airports. This measure follows earlier regulations that already prohibited the charging or stowing of power banks in overhead bins during flights, highlighting growing safety concerns over the ubiquitous devices.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague. This marks the first recorded death from this form of the disease in the county since 2007. While rare in humans, plague is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. Pneumonic plague is the most severe and easily spread form, infecting the lungs. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations and can be transmitted to humans through infected flea bites or by handling infected animals, prompting officials to advise caution.</p>

          <h2>China Poised to Enter Weight-Loss Drug Market as Patents on Popular Treatments Near Expiration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's pharmaceutical industry is preparing to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 similar drugs currently in clinical trials. The market is set to become highly competitive as the Chinese patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs like Ozempic, expires next year. This is expected to lead to the launch of cheaper generic versions from numerous domestic drug makers, potentially making these treatments more affordable for patients. Analysts predict this will significantly increase competition and drive down prices within the rapidly growing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man in Stockton, California, has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly setting a probation officer on fire during a struggle. The suspect reportedly entered the county probation office with a gas can and a lighter, prompting a security alert. When officers confronted him, a tussle ensued in a nearby parking lot, during which the suspect ignited the fuel, causing significant but non-life-threatening burns to one officer's arms. The suspect, who was on supervision for a prior felony, was also injured and taken into custody after the flames were extinguished.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365 million terminal expansion project, signaling confidence despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to rising tariffs and global trade tensions. The project, led by operator International Transportation Service, will expand the quay to accommodate larger ships and is expected to boost cargo-handling capacity by 50 percent. Officials acknowledged the current uncertainty in the shipping industry but emphasized the long-term need for infrastructure investment to strengthen America's supply chain. The move comes as both the Port of Long Beach and nearby Port of Los Angeles have reported recent drops in container movement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,000 employees as part of a broader Trump administration initiative to reduce the federal workforce. The involuntary cuts include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, following the voluntary departure of over 1,500 other employees earlier this year. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the cuts will undermine national security and diplomatic work. The layoffs notably affected the bureau responsible for refugee resettlement and the office coordinating Afghan relocation efforts, sparking protests outside the department.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Known as "El Raton," Guzman Lopez admitted to his role in leading the Sinaloa Cartel alongside his brothers after their father's extradition and conviction. As part of his plea agreement, he will cooperate with prosecutors and forfeit $80 million in assets, likely receiving a reduced sentence. His 2023 capture in Mexico and subsequent extradition were major events in the ongoing effort to dismantle the powerful cartel.</p>
