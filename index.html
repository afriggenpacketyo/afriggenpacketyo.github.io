            <h2>Tariff Uncertainty Fuels Consumer Anxiety and Market Volatility</h2>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing widespread confusion and anxiety among American consumers, who are unsure whether to stock up on goods or delay purchases. Retailers have seen a jump in visits and purchases ahead of tariff announcements, but analysts warn this behavior is likely temporary. The tariffs, particularly on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices for clothing, electronics, and toys, potentially costing the typical US family thousands of dollars annually. The economic uncertainty is also causing market turmoil, with some businesses cancelling shipments and economists predicting slower growth or even a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An Israeli airstrike has reportedly damaged the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, leading to the displacement of patients and staff. The Hamas-run health ministry reports that the intensive care and surgery departments were destroyed, but no casualties were reported. The IDF claims the hospital contained a Hamas command center and that steps were taken to minimize harm to civilians. This incident follows a previous attack on the same hospital in October 2023, which resulted in hundreds of fatalities and conflicting accounts of responsibility.</p>

            <p>After a period of decline during the pandemic, high heels are experiencing a resurgence, driven by various factors including a return to traditional femininity and a form of rebellion against current anxieties. The article explores the complex politics of heels, spanning gender, wealth, identity, and power, and their reappearance during moments of political unrest. Some are embracing heels as a marker of retrogressive femininity, while others wear them as a performance of protest, a fantasy costume that speaks to the anxiety and disconnect between the world we want and the world we have. Today, heels serve as a constant reminder of having a body, sitting up straight, and thinking about how to get where we're going.</p>

            <p>Taiwan is experiencing heightened political tension as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supports a recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers. The DPP seeks to regain control of the legislature, which is currently dominated by the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP). The campaign has energized pro-DPP groups but risks deepening partisan divisions at a time when Taiwan faces pressure from Beijing.

            <p>The article critiques Donald Trump's tariff policies, arguing they are more extensive and potentially damaging than the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, raising fears of a global recession. It suggests that Britain should distance itself from Trump's administration, despite any desire for close ties, and instead work more closely with the EU to mitigate the economic fallout. The author emphasizes that Trump's actions demonstrate a lack of trustworthiness, regardless of efforts to appease him, and calls for a reevaluation of Britain's relationship with both the US and the EU.</p>

            <p>Roki Sasaki delivered his best start yet for the Dodgers, pitching five innings against the Chicago Cubs, but the team suffered a 16-0 loss. Sasaki allowed one run on a solo home run but pitched out of jams in the third and fifth innings. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Cubs starter Ben Brown, and the game devolved into a rout with relievers giving up multiple runs. Despite the loss, Sasaki's progress was a positive takeaway for the Dodgers.</p>

            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronics from new tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. The move comes after concerns from US tech companies that prices could skyrocket, as many gadgets are made in China. The exemptions are backdated to April 5 and also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. This is the first significant reprieve in Trump's tariffs, and one analyst described it as a "game-changer scenario" for tech investors.</p>

            <p>The 1987 murder of Selonia Reed is revisited, focusing on the perspective of her then-6-year-old son, Reggie Reed Jr., who has written a memoir about the experience. Retired detective Charles Muse and Lt. Barry Ward discuss the investigation, which initially focused on Selonia's husband, Reginald Reed Sr., and his friend, Jimmy Ray Barnes. Years later, DNA evidence and a new prosecutor led to the arrest and conviction of Reginald Reed Sr., though Reggie Jr. struggles to reconcile the investigation's findings with his memories of his father. A key theory is that Selonia was killed in her bedroom while her son slept nearby.</p>
