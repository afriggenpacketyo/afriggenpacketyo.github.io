            <p>During a meeting with President Trump, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not return Kilmar Abrego Garc√≠a, a migrant deported from the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate his return. Bukele dismissed the idea of smuggling a 'terrorist' into the U.S., echoing the Trump administration's claims. Trump officials insisted that Abrego Garcia's fate rests solely with El Salvador, despite acknowledging the wrongful deportation due to a protective order. The Supreme Court's order highlights the conflict between the executive branch's foreign policy and judicial directives, raising questions about the administration's compliance with legal rulings.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with the Trump administration's demands to eliminate its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and ideological screenings for international students. University President Alan Garber defended Harvard's autonomy, asserting that no government should dictate academic or hiring practices. This decision puts nearly $9 billion in federal funding at risk for the university. Garber emphasized that while some demands target antisemitism, most represent undue governmental regulation of Harvard's intellectual environment, sparking a significant clash between academic freedom and government oversight.</p>

            <p>A Texas judge significantly reduced the bond for Karmelo Anthony, accused of fatally stabbing Austin Metcalf at a high school track meet.

            <p>Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, testified in an antitrust trial where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleges Meta is a monopoly. The FTC argues Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp stifled competition and seeks to break up the company. Meta contends it did nothing wrong and faces competition from TikTok and YouTube. The trial's outcome could force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, significantly impacting its revenue and market dominance. Zuckerberg's testimony is a key part of the trial, which will determine the future structure of Meta's social media empire.</p>

The judge described the shooting as an abuse of power. Buen was convicted after a second trial, with prosecutors arguing that he needlessly escalated the situation with Glass, who exhibited signs of a mental health crisis. Glass's family reached a $19 million settlement with the agencies involved, prompting changes in officer training for mental health crises.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller anticipates that the effects of President Trump's tariffs on prices will be "transitory," despite previous inflation challenges. Waller outlined two scenarios for the duties, suggesting that even with larger tariffs, the Fed would still cut interest rates, albeit with different timing. He compared his inflation view to a football analogy, emphasizing that past failures don't preclude future attempts. Waller estimated potential impacts on growth and unemployment depending on the size and duration of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is accused of defying a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant deported to El Salvador. Despite the Court's directive, the administration is deferring to El Salvador's President Bukele, who refuses to return Garcia. Critics argue this behavior demonstrates contempt for the Supreme Court and the rule of law. The administration's actions raise concerns about its willingness to abide by court orders and protect constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>The increasing popularity of zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options is contributing to heightened volatility in the stock market. These options, which expire on the same day they are traded, have seen a surge in trading volume, particularly for the S&P 500. The use of 0DTE options by investors to make quick profits or hedge against market movements can exacerbate price swings. Experts note that the amplified impact of these options adds to the market's sensitivity to event-driven news and tariff-related uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing an emergency application concerning President Trump's authority to remove the Federal Reserve's boss. The case raises questions about the extent of presidential power over agency heads protected by "for-cause" removal statutes. Trump is seeking the same unfettered power he wielded on "The Apprentice," but federal agency heads may require more than a simple dismissal. The court's decision could significantly impact the independence and stability of the Federal Reserve.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring boom in the U.S. Most companies believe the costs to bring supply chains back to the U.S. would double, leading them to seek lower-tariff regimes elsewhere. Automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns, with respondents expressing concerns about the current administration's strategy. The most widespread reaction to tariffs is the cancellation of orders due to anticipated consumer spending pullbacks.</p>
