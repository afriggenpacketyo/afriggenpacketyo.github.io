          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has confirmed that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is not cooperating with authorities. While Robinson remains in custody and has not confessed, Cox noted that those around the suspect are providing information to investigators. The governor also addressed the growing concern over political radicalization, particularly through social media, and urged Americans to choose kindness and reject divisive rhetoric. He emphasized that while external factors contribute to radicalization, the suspect made a personal choice and will be held responsible for his actions.</p>

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning was met with boos from home fans during the team's 27-10 victory over UTEP due to his struggles on offense. Manning completed 11 of 25 passes for 114 yards, with one touchdown and one interception, though he also contributed two rushing touchdowns. After the game, Manning acknowledged his performance, stating, "I've got to play better." Despite the team's offensive inefficiencies, wide receiver Ryan Wingo expressed continued confidence in Manning, highlighting that their chemistry is improving as the season progresses.</p>

The woman, in her 20s, was attacked by two men in Oldbury who reportedly made racist remarks, telling her to "get out" of the country. In a public statement, the victim thanked her family and the community for their "love and support" while police continue to search for the two suspects.

          <p>"Fox & Friends" co-host Brian Kilmeade has issued an apology for comments made on-air suggesting the use of "involuntary lethal injection" for mentally ill homeless individuals. The remarks came during a discussion about a recent fatal stabbing in North Carolina allegedly committed by a homeless man with schizophrenia. Kilmeade's comments drew widespread criticism, with many comparing them to Nazi-era euthanasia programs.

          <p>In a joint television appearance, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford addressed the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the broader issue of rising political violence in the United States. Both senators condemned the act and identified the internet and social media algorithms as key accelerants of extremism and division. They discussed the increasing security threats faced by public officials and their families, which they believe weakens robust political debate. The senators called for bipartisan efforts to reduce online harms, such as passing the Kids Online Safety Act, and urged Americans to reject violence and engage in civil discourse.</p>

          <p>Tributes have poured in from across the sports world for former boxing world champion Ricky Hatton, who has died at the age of 46.

Fellow boxers like Tyson Fury and Amir Khan, along with figures like footballer Wayne Rooney, remembered him as a legend and a warrior.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham warns that the United States is in a "dangerous place." He argues that political violence historically erupts when there are fundamental, unresolved questions about who is considered an American and who is included in the nation's promise. Meacham identifies the current era as one where not just the methods but the very purpose of politics are being debated, creating a climate ripe for conflict. He urges leaders to uphold the "American covenant" of peaceful disagreement and to draw lessons from history to navigate the present turmoil without resorting to violence.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist James Fallows offers a commentary on the recent wave of political violence in America, drawing parallels to the tumultuous period of the 1960s. He warns that such cycles of violence are far more damaging and self-reinforcing than many people realize and cautions against casual rhetoric about "vengeance" and "civil war." Fallows highlights two key lessons from past crises: the importance of generous, unifying reactions in moments of shock, and the need to reject immediate, divisive responses. He concludes by invoking Robert F. Kennedy's call to "tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world."</p>

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, undercover agents purchased canisters of the gas, commonly known as "whippits," from the employees. The arrest reports state that the clerks confirmed the substance could be used for getting high and, in some cases, explained its effects to the agents. The arrests occurred at Max Smoke Shop, Smoke and Vape Atlantic, Smoking Aces, and Miami Smoke Shop as part of an effort to crack down on the misuse of the substance.</p>

Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated.

While Caillebotte is famous for his masterpiece "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, a departure from his contemporaries. Some of his works, like "The Floor Scrapers," were considered scandalous at the time for their realistic and sensuous depictions of working-class men and male nudes. The show aims to integrate Caillebotte more fully into the story of Impressionism, allowing viewers to interpret the complex and beguiling artistry of his work.</p>

          <p>A new law championed by President Trump that makes up to $25,000 in tip income tax-deductible is intensifying the debate around America's tipping culture. While the law provides a temporary tax break for many service workers, critics argue it enables businesses to continue paying low wages and places a greater burden on consumers. The article questions the eligibility criteria, noting that it includes professions like plumbers and "digital content creators" while excluding others like postal workers and teachers. The author suggests that instead of incentivizing tips, the U.S. should move toward a model of paying all workers a fair, living wage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the Israeli public's perception of the ongoing war in Gaza, suggesting that society has become desensitized to Palestinian suffering and adapted to a "new normal" of permanent conflict. The author contends that a media bubble shields most Israelis from the war's true cost, allowing daily life to continue largely uninterrupted while the military institutionalizes its operations in Gaza. The piece explores a shift in public discourse from political debate to a mythical, victim-centric narrative that frames the conflict as an eternal, biblical struggle. This mindset, the author argues, fosters passivity when urgent action is needed.</p>

          <h2>Immigrant Communities in Los Angeles Face Heightened Fear After Supreme Court Ruling on Raids</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling has intensified fear and apprehension within Los Angeles's immigrant communities, as it allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and potentially engage in racial profiling. The decision overturned a temporary restraining order that had limited such practices in California. In response to a Department of Homeland Security vow to "flood the zone," many undocumented workers face a difficult choice between risking deportation by going to work or staying home and facing eviction. Community organizers and volunteer groups are increasing their efforts, deploying observers to vulnerable areas to document raids and inform residents of their rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new "Make Our Children Healthy Again" report is facing criticism from health advocates for its near-total omission of the words "nicotine," "smoking," and "tobacco." The 20-page strategy, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to combat childhood chronic disease but focuses on public service campaigns about alcohol and illegal vapes rather than comprehensive tobacco control. Critics, including the former head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, argue that ignoring tobacco—the leading cause of preventable death—is a major failure. The report's release also coincides with administration cuts to the very CDC and FDA offices responsible for tobacco control programs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aiming to manage the diplomatic fallout from a recent Israeli strike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders. The attack angered Qatar, a key U.S. ally, and has complicated hostage negotiations. While Rubio's visit is intended to convey President Trump's displeasure, he has also signaled broad U.S. support for Israel as it faces international criticism and potential recognition of a Palestinian state by several allied nations. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance, calling it as "durable as the stones in the Western Wall."</p>

          <p>Team Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Luke Donald, has implemented a novel training method to prepare his players for the anticipated hostile crowd at Bethpage, New York: virtual reality headsets that shout abuse. Rory McIlroy revealed that players were given the equipment to simulate the intense sights and sounds they will face from American fans. McIlroy stated he encouraged the simulation to "go as far as you want," allowing players to desensitize themselves to potential name-calling and distractions. This attention to detail is part of Europe's strategy to overcome the challenge of winning on American soil, something they have not accomplished since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, sports analysts are weighing in on the key matchups and potential outcomes. While the absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese due to injury changes the narrative, the focus shifts to established stars and top-seeded teams. Experts identify the high-seeded Phoenix Mercury as a team at risk for an early exit. Many predict a finals matchup between the Las Vegas Aces and the Minnesota Lynx, with several analysts favoring the Lynx to complete their "revenge tour" and win the championship after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, led by likely MVP Napheesa Collier.</p>

          <p>Following a strong earnings season, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several technology stocks poised for long-term growth, largely driven by the artificial intelligence boom. Semiconductor firm Broadcom is favored due to accelerating AI demand and a new $10 billion customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity company Zscaler is highlighted for strong demand for its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Finally, Oracle's stock is rising based on massive growth in its cloud business, with its remaining performance obligations surging 359% year-over-year, indicating robust future revenue from major AI-related contracts.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre is publicly calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her when she was 17. In an interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that every person, regardless of royal status, "deserves to be held to the fullest extent of the law." Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability. The family expressed that the prince being stripped of his titles and publicly shamed is not sufficient justice and that he should be investigated.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is being urged by the Commons Business and Trade Committee to intensify pressure on the U.S. to remove remaining tariffs on British steel. A trade deal signed in June reduced tariffs on some goods but left the 25% tariff on steel in place, a major sticking point in economic relations. The committee's report emphasizes that the high-profile visit is a key opportunity to finalize a lasting "economic prosperity deal" that would end the threat of future tariffs. The visit, Trump's second as president, is set to include significant pageantry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent developments at major U.S. media conglomerates suggest a growing influence of right-wing perspectives, raising concerns about press freedom. At CBS News, a Trump ally was installed as an ombudsman shortly after the network's parent company, Paramount, was taken over by the Trump-friendly Ellison family. Paramount is now reportedly considering an acquisition of CNN's parent company, potentially bringing another major news network under its influence. This trend, combined with the settlement of the Murdoch family feud ensuring Fox News's conservative direction, is seen by media critics as a potential capitulation to the Trump administration's political pressures.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a state law that allows individuals with permits to carry firearms openly on college campuses. While it is not yet clear if the suspected shooter legally possessed the rifle, the incident has highlighted Utah's permissive gun laws, which include permitless concealed carry and a lack of "red flag" laws. The state has previously focused campus safety efforts on "school hardening" measures. Critics argue that such laws are inadequate for addressing politically motivated violence and that more screening is needed at public events on campuses.</p>
