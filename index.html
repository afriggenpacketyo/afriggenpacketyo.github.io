        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the display of the Mexican flag at protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles is not an act of disloyalty but rather a demonstration of the deep-rooted Mexican-American heritage in California.  The author contends that the Mexican flag is as much a part of California's identity as iconic landmarks like Hollywood and the Golden Gate Bridge.  The author connects this to historical contributions of Mexican immigrants to the state's wealth and prosperity, emphasizing their right to express their pride in their heritage. The author uses the event to highlight the divisive rhetoric of former President Trump.</p>
