          <p>Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has publicly requested donations of unwanted pets, such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as horses, to feed its carnivorous animals. The zoo stated this practice aligns with its responsibility to replicate the natural food chain, providing predators with "whole prey" for better nutrition and well-being. The animals are humanely euthanized by trained staff before being used as fodder. This initiative is presented as a way to ensure nothing goes to waste while promoting natural behaviors in the zoo's predators.</p>

          <p>In response to new tariffs announced by the Trump administration, CBS News has created a price tracker to monitor the costs of everyday goods for American consumers. The tool focuses on products likely to be affected by the import duties, particularly groceries like fruits and vegetables, many of which are imported. Economists anticipate that the costs associated with these tariffs will be passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices in the coming months. The tracker uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show price changes across various categories. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has awarded CEO Elon Musk a new stock grant worth approximately $29 billion, aimed at incentivizing him to remain with the company amidst a growing "war for AI talent." This move follows a Delaware court's decision to invalidate his previous, larger pay package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. The board emphasized the importance of retaining Musk's leadership as Tesla transitions from an electric vehicle manufacturer to a company focused on AI and robotics. The award is intended to secure his attention as he also manages several other major tech ventures.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author recounts how watching "The Muppet Show" became a source of comfort and a way to process grief following her father's death. Her father, Marshall Brickman, was a writer who had briefly worked with Jim Henson and was credited with creating the Swedish Chef's distinctive mock-Swedish language. Rediscovering the show with her own children, she found its blend of silliness and sophistication to be an antidote to her daily dread. The experience allowed her to connect with her father's memory and navigate the profound sense of loss through the surreal, comforting world of the Muppets.</p>

          <p>A deepening food crisis in Gaza, marked by mass hunger and images of starving children, represents a significant moral and strategic failure for Israel, according to this analysis. The article argues that the Netanyahu government's policies, which restricted aid and sidelined UN relief agencies in an attempt to weaken Hamas, have backfired and are now causing a catastrophic famine. The author contends that the only viable path forward is for Israel to immediately "flood the zone" with food by lifting all restrictions on humanitarian groups, which is presented as both a moral imperative and a strategic necessity to salvage its international standing.</p>

The unrest, which began on Saturday and continued overnight, required a coordinated operation by state and military forces to regain control of the facility in Tuxpan. According to local media reports, the violence erupted after a group of inmates had asked authorities for protection from threats made by another group of prisoners allegedly belonging to a violent criminal organization, highlighting ongoing issues of cartel influence and overcrowding in Mexico's prisons.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, an industrial mechanic and union leader who organized workers during the Kellogg's strike, is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska as an independent. Positioning himself as a working-class alternative to the wealthy incumbent, Osborn aims to break the two-party logjam in Washington. He outperformed expectations in a previous Senate race against a different Republican, narrowing the margin in a state Donald Trump won decisively. His campaign is seen as a test of whether a non-partisan, blue-collar message can gain traction in a deeply red state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to legal scholars and former prosecutors, the U.S. Department of Justice is being transformed into a "personal weapon" for President Trump, undermining the rule of law. Critics point to the recent ousting of staff who worked on cases involving Trump and his allies, as well as the launch of new investigations into his political rivals, as evidence of dangerous politicization. They argue that loyalty to the president has replaced loyalty to the Constitution, turning the department into a tool to pursue personal and political agendas rather than impartial justice.</p>

          <p>A tense standoff occurred between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese coast guard ships near the disputed Dongsha Islands. Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration reported that it dispatched a patrol vessel to shadow a Chinese ship that had entered Taiwan-claimed waters and ignored repeated radio warnings to turn away. At one point, the two armed vessels were separated by just one nautical mile before the Chinese boat eventually changed course and withdrew. The incident underscores the persistent maritime friction and sovereignty disputes between Taipei and Beijing in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>A new survey of American children suggests that excessive screen time is not just a product of addictive technology, but also a consequence of restricted childhoods. The data reveals that while most children are not allowed to play unsupervised in public, they overwhelmingly prefer unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socializing. The article argues that kids turn to their phones because it is one of the few realms where they can interact without adult supervision. Restoring real-world independence is presented as the key to helping children put down their devices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has implemented a new policy requiring all event attendance by defense officials to be vetted, a move critics are calling a form of isolationism. The directive followed the last-minute cancellation of senior officers' appearances at the Aspen Security Forum, which a Pentagon spokesperson criticized as promoting "globalism." Defense officials and policy experts warn that this partisan-tinged vetting process risks cutting the military off from outside ideas, fostering groupthink, and damaging the strategic thinking necessary for national security.</p>

          <p>The global fur industry has experienced a dramatic collapse, with the number of animals farmed for their pelts falling from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This article explains the transformation, attributing it to a major shift in public perception that turned fur from a luxury good into an ethical misstep. The decline was driven by successful animal welfare campaigns pressuring major fashion brands, legislative bans across Europe, and the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks on mink farms. This represents one of the most significant advocacy victories of the 21st century.</p>
