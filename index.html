          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst faced criticism at a town hall in Iowa regarding proposed Medicaid cuts under President Trump's legislative agenda. Constituents expressed concerns that these cuts could threaten access to healthcare and food benefits, potentially leading to deaths. Ernst responded by stating that everyone will eventually die, while also asserting that the bill would protect those most vulnerable and eligible for Medicaid. She argued that removing ineligible individuals from the program would strengthen it, a claim met with skepticism and further protest from the audience. The debate highlights the ongoing tension surrounding healthcare and social safety nets in the context of government spending and priorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, a week after suggesting he approved a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keen to understand the structure of the deal, particularly after President Biden previously blocked the acquisition on national security grounds. Trump has described the deal as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a significant investment from Nippon. Senator Dave McCormick indicated that the U.S. government would retain a "golden share" to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that China violated its trade agreement with the U.S., and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that talks between the two countries have stalled. Meanwhile, Trump's global tariff policy faced a setback as federal courts ruled against his unilateral imposition of some levies, though the tariffs remain in place pending appeal. Elon Musk is stepping down from his role as a "special government employee" but will continue to advise Trump unofficially. This comes amid Musk's criticism of Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" for increasing the federal deficit, reflecting a complex relationship between the tech mogul and the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a press event to celebrate Elon Musk as the Tesla CEO concluded his official government service after leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for four months. Musk's departure coincides with the exit of several top staffers from DOGE, including Steve Davis and Katie Miller. Despite public clashes with Trump and Cabinet members on issues like tariffs and the federal budget deficit, Trump lauded Musk as "terrific" and stated that he would continue to assist the administration. Musk's DOGE aimed to cut government spending, but its reported savings have fallen short of initial predictions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Richard MontaÃ±ez, who claimed to have invented Flaminâ€™ Hot Cheetos, against Frito-Lay and PepsiCo. MontaÃ±ez alleged defamation and harm to his career after the companies disputed his role in creating the snack. The judge ruled that MontaÃ±ez's accusations lacked factual support but allowed him the opportunity to amend his lawsuit with additional facts. The lawsuit followed a 2021 Los Angeles Times investigation that questioned MontaÃ±ezâ€™s rags-to-riches story, which had been widely circulated for years. The judge noted that MontaÃ±ez had mutually benefited from the companies' support, undermining his claim of unjust enrichment.</p>

          <p>Recent violence in Tripoli, Libya, has raised concerns about a potential return to civil war, but it has also sparked protests and calls for national elections and a new constitution. The violence erupted after Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah ordered the dismantling of armed militias, leading to clashes between pro-government forces and armed groups. Observers suggest that Dbeibah is attempting to consolidate control over militias in the west, similar to Khalifa Haftar in the east. The UN is considering four options to end Libya's transitional phase, including simultaneous or sequential presidential and legislative elections.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether Ramon Morales Reyes, who was arrested for allegedly threatening to shoot and kill President Trump, may be the victim of a setup. Law enforcement sources indicate that Reyes' handwriting did not match the threatening letter, and they believe he may have been targeted by another man in jail on similar charges. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially praised the arrest but has not commented on the possibility of Reyes being framed. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case, adding complexity to the situation.</p>

          <p>A US court ruling suspending many of President Trump's tariffs on imported goods initially offered a glimmer of hope for the EU, but an appeals court quickly suspended that order, reinstating the tariffs. The legal battle centers on the extent of presidential power over trade policy. For the EU, the focus remains on ongoing negotiations with the US to resolve trade disputes and avoid further escalation. The EU has offered a "zero-for-zero" tariff trade deal, but progress has been limited, as the two countries continue to negotiate a solution that addresses Trump's concerns about trade imbalances.

After a defeat to a South-East Asia select XI, some players were seen at a club, while others were involved in minor incidents, such as Amad Diallo making an obscene gesture to a fan. Despite some fan enthusiasm, the tour has not reached the same levels as previous visits, with attendance and engagement lower than in the past.</p>

          <p>The film *Bring Her Back* showcases Sally Hawkins as Laura, a foster mother with ulterior motives, who takes in two teen siblings, Andy and Piper, after their father dies. While the film provides an excellent vehicle for Hawkins, it swerves away from the youthful energy of the director's previous work, *Talk To Me*, and leans into a story about trauma and loss with a supernatural element. The film explores the nature of abuse that children can face from adults, though it is treated as a plot twist. The movie comes to life in the nastier, grislier set pieces, as the director showcases the portrayal of Laura's story, building to a devastating and intense conclusion about the extent of her loss and her inability to deal with it.</p>
