            <p>NASA's Don Pettit, along with cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, concluded their 220-day mission on the International Space Station, landing safely in Kazakhstan. Pettit, celebrating his 70th birthday on landing day, experienced a slightly disoriented state upon arrival, though no major medical issues were reported. The mission, which began last September, saw the crew complete 3,520 orbits, covering 93.3 million miles. Concerns about the ISS's aging infrastructure and budget shortfalls were raised, highlighting the increasing risks associated with maintaining the orbiting laboratory until its planned deorbit in 2030.</p>
