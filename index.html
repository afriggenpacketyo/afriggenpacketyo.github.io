        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC study has identified the top ten states for workers in 2025, with Texas, Florida, and Georgia leading the list. The rankings were determined by factors such as workforce educational attainment, STEM worker concentration, state training programs, and net migration of skilled labor. The report notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has largely eased, significant worker deficits persist in some states. Texas was named number one due to its large pool of homegrown talent, high concentration of career-focused high school students, and strong worker productivity, making it a prime location for companies seeking a robust workforce.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a court ruling that blocked a federal rule to automatically remove medical debt from credit reports, consumers must now take personal action to manage these financial burdens. This article outlines five effective strategies for individuals to clear medical debt from their credit history. These methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating settlements with collection agencies, and applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care programs. Additionally, consumers can explore debt management plans through credit counseling or verify if their debt qualifies for automatic removal under the credit bureaus' existing policies for small balances under $500.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analyst Suggests IMAX is a Strong Investment in the Film Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:33:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, IMAX presents a compelling investment opportunity within the struggling movie industry due to its unique and successful business model. Unlike traditional theaters, IMAX primarily sells or leases its high-demand theater systems and provides maintenance, allowing it to profit from the premium ticket prices theaters can charge. The company reported its best-ever first quarter, is on track for record box office receipts, and is expanding significantly in international markets. With a strong pipeline of films and partnerships with streamers like Netflix and Apple, IMAX's growth potential is considered high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year, €2 trillion budget framework that significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase. Announced by President Ursula von der Leyen, the budget aims to address current geopolitical realities while also dedicating about 35% of funds to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The plan seeks to streamline access to funding and introduces new revenue streams, including duties on e-waste and tobacco, to avoid increasing member state contributions. The proposal, which also triples migration management funds and allocates €100 billion for Ukraine, requires unanimous approval from member states.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, debuted with a successful $122 million at the domestic box office. In a recent interview, Gunn explained his approach to the iconic character, emphasizing a more human and vulnerable portrayal to create a more balanced universe of heroes. He highlighted the central theme of kindness in an unkind world, drawing a parallel between Superman showing compassion to his nemesis, Lex Luthor, and people showing tolerance for differing political beliefs. Gunn also discussed Superman's identity as an immigrant, a core element established by his creators, the children of immigrants Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.</p>

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has suspended four Members of Parliament for rebelling against the party's position on a government welfare bill. The four MPs were part of a larger group of 47 Labour rebels who voted against proposed welfare cuts, forcing the government to amend its plans. The suspended MPs, including Rachael Maskell, have defended their actions, stating they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support policies that would impoverish disabled people. This move highlights internal party divisions and challenges Starmer's authority following a series of recent policy reversals by the Labour leadership.</p>

          <p>A major legislative package from the Trump administration introduces significant changes to the federal student loan system, most notably by establishing lifetime borrowing limits. Effective July 1, 2026, for new borrowers, the bill sets a total lifetime cap of $257,500 for all federal student loans. It also imposes new annual and lifetime limits for graduate students and parents borrowing through the Parent PLUS program, while eliminating Grad PLUS loans entirely. Experts suggest these changes will reshape how students finance higher education, potentially forcing them toward private loans or causing high-priced universities to lower tuition to remain accessible.</p>

The package has faced opposition from some Senate Republicans, creating a narrow path for approval and requiring Vice President JD Vance to cast tie-breaking votes to advance the measure.

The charges stem from a November 2022 incident where the officer, John J. Hawk, fatally attacked 48-year-old Kenneth Vinyard outside a Walmart. Vinyard was attempting to provide police with information about a shooting when Hawk, who was in civilian clothes, struck him and caused him to fall, leading to his death.

          <p>As former Dodgers pitcher Julio Urías's suspension for violating MLB's domestic and sexual assault policy concludes, his agent, Scott Boras, has stated that Urías has every intention of continuing his professional baseball career. Urías, the only player to be suspended twice under this policy, will be removed from the league's restricted list, making him a free agent. The suspension was imposed after a video showed him in a physical altercation with his wife in September 2023. Boras noted that Urías is currently getting in shape and will have options, though it remains uncertain which teams might be interested in signing him.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a stellar performance by its trading divisions. The bank's traders generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. This success is attributed to increased market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, which benefits trading-heavy firms like Goldman. Investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% rise as more advisory deals closed. The strong results highlight the bank's ability to capitalize on turbulent market conditions, with its stock up 23% this year.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, ProPublica climate reporter Abrahm Lustgarten described the recent devastating floods in Texas as an "early warning" of the chaotic future that could result from climate change. Lustgarten expressed that the combination of increasingly erratic and extreme weather events with the undermining of science and budget cuts to critical agencies like FEMA and NOAA should be a matter of extraordinary concern. He suggests that these events are not isolated incidents but rather indicators of a systemic problem where the country is becoming less prepared to handle disasters at the very moment they are becoming more common and severe.</p>

          <p>A report from Deutsche Welle suggests First Lady Melania Trump may be a surprising advocate for Ukraine within the White House. President Trump recently revealed that his wife often points out the discrepancy between his cordial phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. This has led to a flurry of positive reactions on Ukrainian social media, with users nicknaming her "Agent Melania Trumpenko." Growing up in the former Yugoslavia, her background is seen by some as giving her a unique understanding of the threat posed by Russia, potentially influencing the President's recent hardening stance and deadline for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A timeline from The Guardian tracks the evolution of the Jeffrey Epstein controversy and its recent impact on Donald Trump's relationship with his base. It begins with Epstein's 2019 arrest and Trump's subsequent deflection of questions toward Bill Clinton. The timeline then follows the unsealing of documents, Trump's shifting stance on declassifying files during the campaign, and the eventual Justice Department announcement that no "client list" exists. This conclusion triggered a backlash from right-wing commentators and Trump supporters, prompting the president to lash out at his own base, pleading with them to drop what he now calls a "boring" issue.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife following a dispute over sharing a changing room with a transgender colleague. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the allegations, which included misconduct and misgendering. The case has brought attention to the complexities of balancing transgender inclusion with the rights of cisgender women. An employment tribunal brought by Peggie against the health board is ongoing, focusing on whether her treatment was unlawful under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Republican senators have successfully amended a government spending reduction bill to exempt the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) from cuts. The original proposal sought to rescind $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, but bipartisan concern led to the funds being restored, leaving the total proposed cuts at $9 billion. Pepfar, launched under President George W. Bush, is credited with saving tens of millions of lives, particularly in Africa. The amendment, supported by the White House, means the revised bill must now return to the House of Representatives for another vote before a key deadline.</p>

She advised forming an inclusive movement with exciting new candidates who can focus on relatable issues like the cost of living, rather than purely technical legal arguments. Cseh emphasized that since Trump's MAGA movement has modeled itself on Orbán's, studying Hungary's democratic backsliding provides a vital playbook for resistance.</p>

The review by Lord David Anderson KC found that although teachers referred Rudakubana to Prevent three times for his obsession with violence, his case was closed because he lacked a clear terrorist ideology. Lord Anderson called for the program to be reformed to address individuals fascinated with extreme violence, regardless of ideological motive, and to improve monitoring of public online activity to identify future attackers.</p>
