          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including imposing steep tariffs on India and threatening sanctions over its Russian oil imports, are jeopardizing the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). This informal alliance, which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, is a key component of Washington's strategy to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. The sudden friction has surprised allies like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had previously cultivated a strong relationship with Trump. These moves risk unraveling a significant foreign policy achievement from Trump's first term, seemingly for domestic political reasons rather than strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel is set to reach 50,000 since the Labour party assumed power, a figure ministers call "unacceptable." The government highlights a new "one in, one out" returns agreement with France as a deterrent, though its initial impact is expected to be small. Critics, including the Conservative Party and Reform UK, argue the numbers signify a failure to control the border and an ongoing crisis. This milestone creates significant political pressure on the government, which has pledged to dismantle the people-smuggling networks responsible for the dangerous journeys.</p>

This move mirrors a similar offer from competitor OpenAI and highlights the intense competition among AI firms to secure influential government contracts and deepen ties with policymakers. Anthropic has already developed specialized models for national security customers and is part of a broader trend of major AI companies establishing a strong presence in Washington, D.C.

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened "immediate legal action" against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store. Musk alleges that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing the placement of his xAI's Grok chatbot. This follows Musk's previous criticism of Apple's integration of OpenAI's technology at the operating system level, which he called an "unacceptable security violation." The threat adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

Originating near the Cabo Verde islands, the storm has already caused flooding and fatalities there, prompting a state of emergency. While early models project it will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean, it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. Erin is the fifth named storm of what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts will be an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, which runs through November.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, who allegedly faked his own death to flee the U.S. and avoid charges for a 2008 sexual assault, faced his alleged victim in a Utah court as his trial began. After being extradited from Scotland, where he claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, Rossi appeared in court in a wheelchair. The prosecution portrayed him as a manipulative individual who took advantage of a vulnerable woman, while the defense argued the accuser's motives were based on resentment. This is the first of two separate sexual assault cases Rossi faces in Utah, culminating a bizarre saga of aliases and evasion.</p>

          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is solidifying with a strong sense of continuity from its victorious 2023 squad, a stability the U.S. team currently lacks. Key players like Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy, and Justin Rose have already secured their spots, with others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expected to follow. Captain Luke Donald will likely use his picks to include established stars such as Jon Rahm, whose LIV Golf participation affects his automatic qualification. This consistent lineup is seen as a major advantage, contrasting with the uncertainty and potential for a playing captain on the American side.</p>

          <p>As college costs approach $100,000 at some U.S. institutions, The Princeton Review has released its list of the top 10 colleges for financial aid. The ranking highlights schools that are most generous with their aid packages, significantly reducing the out-of-pocket cost for students. For instance, Washington and Lee University, which tops the list, has a sticker price of over $86,000 but an average need-based scholarship of over $67,000. The report underscores that few families pay the full tuition, relying on a combination of savings, scholarships, grants, and loans to cover educational expenses.</p>

          <p>School records released after a long legal battle reveal the gradual decline of the gunman responsible for the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Initially described as a "motivated thinker" in kindergarten, Salvador Ramos accumulated numerous disciplinary issues for bullying and harassment by middle school. His academic performance deteriorated until he withdrew from high school seven months before the attack due to failing grades and poor attendance. The thousands of pages of documents confirm his troubled history but offer few new revelations about the shooting or the heavily criticized police response.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns star defensive end Myles Garrett has received his eighth speeding citation in recent years after being caught driving 100 mph in a 60 mph zone. The incident occurred on a highway in suburban Cleveland shortly after the team returned from a preseason game. This latest citation comes three years after Garrett was hospitalized following a serious single-vehicle crash where he was also found to be speeding. Garrett, the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, faces a $250 fine for the violation, continuing a pattern of reckless driving behavior.</p>

Paltrow was engaged to Pitt in the late 1990s, while Aniston was married to him from 2000 to 2005. In the same interview, Aniston also reflected on the death of her "Friends" co-star Matthew Perry, stating she is glad he is now "out of that pain."</p>

The growth was fueled by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which now stands at $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, the strong revenue performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. Circle also announced a new blockchain, Arc, for stablecoin payments.

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, the ongoing trade dispute is expected to continue altering global shipping patterns throughout the year. Analysts predict a full-year decline in container volumes on the critical transpacific route, which will maintain downward pressure on freight rates. Shipping data already shows a significant drop in rates from their peak in early June, when exporters rushed to ship goods ahead of potential tariffs. While China-U.S. volumes have contracted, major carriers note that this has been offset by strong import growth in other regions. (not investment advice)</p>

The shift highlights the intense competition in China's on-demand delivery market, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the industry is moving toward a "near-duopoly." While Meituan is expected to maintain its dominance in food delivery, its overall share of the broader instant commerce market could fall to 48% by 2030, nearly equal to Alibaba's projected 47% share.
