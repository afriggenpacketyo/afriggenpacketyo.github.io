          <p>A major 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East coast has generated tsunami waves, prompting warnings across the Pacific, including Hawaii, Japan, and the North American West Coast. The first waves reaching Hawaii were relatively small, with a four-foot height recorded at one gauge, but authorities urged caution as the event could last for hours. Shelters were opened, and residents were advised to move inland, while similar advisories were issued for Oregon, California, and British Columbia. The event is one of the strongest earthquakes recorded globally in over a decade.</p>

          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter profit before tax of $6.3 billion, falling short of analyst expectations due to impairment charges and lost income from divested businesses. Despite the miss, the bank announced a new $3 billion share buyback program.

The bank warned that lending demand would likely remain subdued but anticipates growth in its wealth division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic biathlon gold medalist Laura Dahlmeier has been seriously injured after being caught in a rockfall during a climbing expedition in Pakistan's Karakoram mountains. The incident occurred at an altitude of approximately 5,700 meters, and her mountaineering partner immediately called for help. A rescue operation was initiated, but challenging weather and the remote location delayed a helicopter from reaching her until the following day. Dahlmeier, an experienced mountaineer, retired from professional competition in 2019.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire and take steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "abate the suffering of the Palestinian people" and help secure a ceasefire. The decision drew sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism, while domestic UK parties were divided on the timing and conditions of the recognition. This policy shift marks a significant development in the UK's approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>An attempt to launch the first Australian-designed and manufactured orbital rocket, named Eris, ended in failure when the vehicle crashed just 14 seconds after liftoff. The rocket, developed by Gilmour Space Technologies, launched from a spaceport in Queensland but fell out of sight after clearing the launch tower. Despite not reaching orbit, the company hailed the test as a success, noting that all engines ignited and the rocket got off the pad, which was a primary goal. No injuries were reported, and the launch site infrastructure remained intact after the incident.</p>

The bank's global wealth management division also saw a 12% increase in transaction-based income. CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that while markets are recovering, client activity reflects a cautious wait-and-see attitude amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.

          <p>Despite the FTSE-100 stock index reaching record highs and outperforming many global peers this year, its success is not a direct reflection of the UK's economic health. The index's strength is largely driven by its high concentration of internationally focused companies in defensive and cyclical sectors like finance, energy, and mining, which derive most of their earnings overseas. A weaker pound often boosts the Footsie's value, a dynamic that underscores its detachment from the domestic British economy. This contrasts with its origins in 1984 when it was dominated by UK-focused businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fossil Discovery in China Suggests Ancient Marine Animals Practiced 'Social Distancing'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have practiced a form of social distancing to enhance its survival. A 436-million-year-old fossil of the brachiopod species Nucleospira calypta, found in Guizhou province, revealed hundreds of fine, bristle-like structures. Researchers believe these structures, known as setae, were used to maintain a regular, checkerboard-like spacing between individuals on the sea floor. This arrangement likely optimized their ability to filter feed by ensuring each animal had adequate space, demonstrating a sophisticated behavioral adaptation for resource management.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK will recognize Palestinian statehood is a significant shift in foreign policy, intended as a "diplomatic crowbar" to restart the peace process, according to BBC analysis. The move, which is contingent on Israel's actions regarding a ceasefire, aims to empower moderates on both sides and jolt them into believing peace is possible. The decision was met with a fierce rejection from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but was applauded at the UN. Foreign Secretary David Lammy framed the policy as correcting a "historical injustice" stemming from Britain's past promises to Palestinians.</p>
