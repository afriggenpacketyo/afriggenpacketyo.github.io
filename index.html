          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old semiconductor company, is experiencing a surge in its stock value, more than doubling this year, due to its specialized purple active electrical cables (AECs) becoming crucial for AI data centers. These $300-$500 cables are preferred by hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft for their reliability over fiber optics, preventing costly outages in massive GPU clusters. JPMorgan Chase initiated buy coverage, predicting the AEC market will hit $4 billion by 2028, with Credo holding an estimated 88% market share. The company expects significant revenue growth and profitability, benefiting from the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Red Cross has retrieved the coffin of a deceased hostage in the southern Gaza Strip, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirming the transfer is underway to their troops. The IDF urged public sensitivity and awaited official identification, which would first be provided to the family. This follows Hamas's earlier statement committing to hand over the body and their claim to have returned all recoverable remains. The broader ceasefire agreement required Hamas to return all deceased hostages, a point of contention as not all bodies have been accounted for, leading to continued efforts to locate them.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:32:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of federalized National Guard troops in Illinois, challenging a lower court's block on the order. The Justice Department argues that preventing the deployment undermines the President's Commander-in-Chief authority and jeopardizes federal law enforcement and property amid ongoing protests. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has vehemently opposed the federalization, calling it 'un-American' and asserting the state's sovereignty. The legal battle centers on the interpretation of Title 10, which allows presidential deployment in cases of rebellion or inability to execute federal laws, with courts questioning the administration's justification for actions in Illinois.</p>

          <h2>Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis Envisioned as a Cultural Hub Beyond Technology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis should transcend its designation as merely a tech and housing hub to become a significant center for cultural development within the Greater Bay Area (GBA). The article suggests that with sophisticated technological infrastructure already established in the GBA, the next competitive frontier lies in cultural influence rather than just connectivity. It advocates for a paradigm shift from property-led development to one prioritizing innovation and cultural growth. The vision aims for Hong Kong to emerge as a global cradle for cultural content, exporting its unique identity similar to Hollywood or K-pop.</p>

          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk fell after President Trump expressed his administration's goal to cap the price of GLP-1 weight loss drugs at $150 per month, a significant reduction from current list prices. Trump cited a large price disparity between the U.S. and other nations for these medications, which include Ozempic. While the administration has not yet finalized negotiations, these comments signal an intent to pressure drugmakers to align U.S. prices with international benchmarks. The high cost of GLP-1s remains a barrier for many consumers and employers, with only a fraction of large employers currently offering coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Concerns over credit quality are unsettling bank investors after regional banks, including Zions and Western Alliance, disclosed significant losses from loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) due to alleged misrepresentations. This episode has triggered fears of contagion, reminiscent of the 2023 banking crisis, and highlights hidden risks in a rapidly growing lending category. Post-2008 regulations shifted riskier activities outside regulated banks, but these non-bank lenders heavily rely on bank funding, with NDFI commercial loans reaching $1.14 trillion. Investors are now scrutinizing banks' NDFI exposures, as these loans can lead to swift and near-total write-offs due to collateral issues. (not investment advice)</p>

The scale of destruction, which included one fatality and two missing, has overwhelmed state resources, prompting large-scale air evacuations to shelters in Anchorage.

The works, created in 2011 after Hockney relocated from Beverly Hills to Bridlington, significantly exceeded their estimated value. Sotheby's highlighted this as a rare opportunity to acquire a substantial group of Hockney's digital art. The artist, now 88, turned to his iPad for these plein air studies when traditional painting proved challenging in winter, with the full series later exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a freeze on an additional $11 billion in infrastructure projects managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Democratic-leaning states, citing the ongoing government shutdown. White House budget director Russell Vought stated that 'low priority' projects in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Baltimore could face cancellation. This action follows an earlier freeze of $28 billion in transportation and energy projects, intensifying pressure on congressional Democrats to end the shutdown. The administration's strategy aims to reorient federal priorities and inflict political pain on opposition states, many of which are also 'sanctuary jurisdictions.'</p>

          <p>Jack in the Box, the San Diego-based fast-food chain, is selling its entire stake in subsidiary Del Taco to Yadav Enterprises for $115 million in cash. This divestiture, expected to close in January 2026, includes over 550 Del Taco restaurants. The move aligns with Jack in the Box's 'Jack on Track' revamp, aimed at strengthening its balance sheet and simplifying its asset portfolio. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt. Del Taco, acquired in 2022 for $575 million, has recently struggled, leading to this strategic sale to focus on the core Jack in the Box brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has introduced a new PG-13 content setting for all Instagram users under 18, automatically restricting exposure to content deemed inappropriate for this age group. This update expands existing 'Teen Accounts' features, now filtering out posts on 'certain risky stunts' and 'strong language' from recommendations, and hiding accounts that regularly share inappropriate material. While parents can adjust these settings, the move aims to reassure them about age-appropriate content, drawing a familiar analogy to movie ratings. However, content moderation experts express concern that this broad approach may inadvertently stifle valuable information and creative expression, lacking nuance for complex topics relevant to older teens.</p>

Despite a positive initial reaction to its forecast of $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by fiscal year 2030, some analysts, like RBC Capital Markets' Rishi Jaluria, question the achievability of these numbers. Oracle has significantly benefited from the AI boom, securing major deals with OpenAI and Meta, and reporting substantial remaining performance obligations.

The storm caused massive destruction, including uprooted boardwalks and homes floating off foundations, with one fatality and two missing. Evacuations were complicated by the region's remoteness, leading to residents being flown to Anchorage. This area, already vulnerable to climate change impacts like permafrost thaw and erosion, faces difficult choices regarding rebuilding.

Robotexts have nearly tripled since 2021, as scammers shifted tactics following government crackdowns on calls.
