          <h2>Proposed Immigrant Quota for German Schools Ignites National Debate</h2>

          <p>A German politician's suggestion to implement a quota limiting the number of immigrant students in schools has sparked a contentious national debate. Proponents argue the measure could improve integration and language acquisition, but critics, including teachers' associations and student bodies, warn it would lead to stigmatization and discrimination. The discussion unfolds against a backdrop of broader concerns over Germany's declining educational standards and resource shortages, with many advocating for targeted school support as a more effective solution than imposing quotas.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a large-scale immigration raid on farms in Ventura County, California, families of the nearly 200 detained migrant workers and several arrested activists are desperately trying to locate their loved ones. More than a day after the operation, many individuals remain unaccounted for, with federal agencies and consulates providing scant information. Local community organizations are being inundated with calls from distressed relatives, while academics and advocates criticize the lack of due process and the fear being instilled in the community.</p>

The victory solidifies Taylor's legacy as one of the greatest female boxers, improving her record to 25-1. Following the fight, she acknowledged the immense pressure of the event but remained non-committal about her potential retirement from the sport.</p>

This is the first recorded death from this form of plague in the county since 2007. Plague is naturally present in rodent populations in the western U.S. and can be transmitted to humans by fleas. While treatable with antibiotics if caught early, the pneumonic form, which affects the lungs, is the most deadly and can spread between people.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight-loss drug Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of Chinese firms are developing generic versions. As many as 60 similar drugs are currently under trial, positioning China to become a major player in the rapidly growing global weight-loss market, which is estimated to be worth $150 billion. The introduction of cheaper, locally produced alternatives is expected to significantly increase access for patients in China who currently face high costs for the imported medication.

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365-million expansion project, signaling long-term confidence despite a recent slowdown in port activity due to global trade instability and tariffs. The project will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% and allow the port to accommodate larger ships, which officials say is a necessary investment to strengthen the U.S. supply chain. While acknowledging the current period of uncertainty, port leadership emphasized their commitment to continued building and progress, drawing on lessons learned during the pandemic.

          <p>As part of a broad effort by the Trump administration to shrink the federal workforce, the U.S. State Department has laid off over 1,000 employees. The cuts include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service personnel and follow an earlier round of over 1,500 voluntary departures. Critics, including Democratic senators, have condemned the move, arguing that the indiscriminate layoffs will undermine national security and harm critical functions like refugee resettlement programs. The administration maintains the cuts are a necessary part of a government-wide reorganization.</p>
