        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones, and Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity on his social media platform, calling it a "FAKE letter" and stating the words and drawings are not his. He had previously warned he would sue, and the legal action was formally filed in the Southern District of Florida.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. space program returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. This support is particularly strong among younger Americans and cuts across partisan lines. The survey also found that most people view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. The poll reflects a sustained positive public sentiment towards space exploration.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visa holders, such as students and temporary workers. The fee, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is intended to be implemented in the current fiscal year. While the law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all terms, such as timely departure, the mechanisms for collection and reimbursement have not yet been established. Critics argue this adds another financial hurdle for legal immigration pathways.</p>

          <p>Reality television personality Teddi Mellencamp is speaking out about what she describes as a significant oversight in her cancer treatment journey. She revealed that despite regular check-ups, doctors did not perform full-body scans after finding only stage one melanoma lesions, which she believes allowed the cancer to metastasize undetected. Now diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic melanoma, Mellencamp is urging the public to be proactive advocates for their own health and to ensure they receive comprehensive care. She continues to share her treatment progress to raise awareness.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the now-bankrupt hospital chain Steward Health Care accuses its founding CEO, Ralph de la Torre, and other former executives of driving the company into insolvency through fraud and self-enrichment. The complaint alleges that the insiders misappropriated over $245 million, enriching themselves through dividends and questionable transactions while leaving hospitals undercapitalized. This filing follows years of reports on the company's financial struggles and the lavish spending of its executives, who are now at the center of a federal probe.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat as Amber Weather Warning Issued for Thunderstorms</h2>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for southeast England, cautioning that torrential thunderstorms could bring dangerous flash floods over the weekend. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain may fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning, with the risk heightened by recent heatwaves that have left the ground dry and less able to absorb water. The warning indicates a likelihood of fast-flowing, deep floodwaters, which could disrupt transport, cause power cuts, and flood homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on 18 Russian military intelligence officers and three units of the GRU espionage agency for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The Foreign Office stated the campaign aimed to destabilize Europe and targeted UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions. The action was coordinated with new EU sanctions against Russia, which include a ban on transactions related to the Nord Stream pipeline. UK officials described it as the most significant action against Russian spies since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings.</p>

          <p>Increased production of rare earth minerals in Myanmar, largely to supply China's near-monopoly on the critical materials, is causing significant downstream environmental problems in neighboring Thailand. These minerals are essential for modern technology, but the mining operations are leading to pollution and other ecological issues that cross the border. The situation highlights the complex environmental and geopolitical consequences of the global demand for rare earths. This NPR report investigates the on-the-ground impact in Thailand.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell sharply after the FDA indicated it is re-evaluating the company's gene therapy, Elevidys, following two patient deaths. The agency is reportedly considering asking the company to halt shipments of the treatment, which accounts for over half its revenue. Elevidys has faced controversy since its approval, as its clinical benefit for Duchenne muscular dystrophy remains uncertain. The heightened safety concerns, coupled with the drug's questionable efficacy, have put the company's future in jeopardy, with its stock now down over 87% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The cancellation has drawn criticism from other hosts and politicians, some of whom suggest it was politically motivated after Colbert condemned a legal settlement between Trump and CBS's parent company, Paramount.</p>

          <p>This feature article explores the history of queerness, highlighting its varied acceptance and persecution across different societies and time periods. It notes that while figures like Leonardo da Vinci faced scrutiny, same-sex relationships were common in antiquity and among Japanese samurai. The article contrasts this with the severe punishments enacted under the influence of Christian doctrine, which framed non-binary identities and same-sex love as sinful. It also touches on the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures, arguing for a more diverse historical understanding beyond a binary model.</p>

While Bondi stated the DOJ is ready to move forward, the release of grand jury transcripts is rare and requires court approval. Critics argue that releasing only the transcripts would be insufficient, calling for the disclosure of all evidence, including interviews, videos, and emails.</p>
