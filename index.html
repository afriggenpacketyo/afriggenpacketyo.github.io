          <p>President Trump visited a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," suggesting it could be a model for other states. The facility, built on a remote former airport, is designed to hold up to 5,000 people as part of an expanded deportation effort. Despite criticism over harsh conditions and legal challenges from environmental groups, the administration touts its remote, wildlife-filled location as a low-cost deterrent to escape. Officials state the center is an efficient way to carry out the administration's mass deportation policy.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to the new "Alligator Alcatraz" detention facility, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a stark warning for migrants to self-deport. She stated that those who leave voluntarily may have a chance to return legally, but those detained at the high-security Florida facility will be barred from re-entering the U.S. permanently. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis added that the center will fast-track immigration hearings, with National Guard members deputized as judges to process cases within days. The facility is presented as a key component of the administration's aggressive deportation strategy.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended the need for controls, stating the EU's external border protection is insufficient, but emphasized cooperation with Poland to solve the "common problem."

          <p>The Trump administration has unexpectedly withheld more than $6 billion in federal education grants just before the traditional July 1 disbursement date. State education officials were notified that the funding is under review "given the change in Administrations," a move described as unprecedented by school superintendent associations. The grants support a wide range of programs, including migrant education, teacher professional development, and after-school activities for students in many low-income districts.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed President Trump's major domestic policy bill with a 51-50 vote, requiring Vice President JD Vance to cast the tie-breaker. The legislation, which faced opposition from three Republican senators, now returns to the House of Representatives with substantial changes. Its future remains uncertain in the lower chamber, where Speaker Mike Johnson has a slim majority and faces resistance from conservative members concerned about the bill's projected $3 trillion addition to the federal deficit. The passage marks a victory for Senate leadership but sets up a challenging path to meet the president's July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to NYU Stern professor and CEO Suzy Welch, a crucial question can reveal a company's true values during a job interview. Instead of asking about a company's stated values, she advises candidates to ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" This question often elicits more honest and unrehearsed answers, cutting through corporate platitudes to expose the real work culture. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" provide genuine insight into expectations around work-life balance and office dynamics, helping job seekers find a better cultural fit.</p>

The reforms were passed despite opposition from environmental groups who are concerned about weakened protections.

This article outlines four common mistakes to avoid, including not monitoring the fluctuating rate climate and assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions. Experts also warn against overborrowing, even with lower rates, as the home serves as collateral and is at risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. Finally, homeowners are advised to use HELOCs for strategic purposes, like value-adding home renovations, rather than for discretionary spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has given U.S. infrastructure a "C" grade, highlighting the accelerating threat posed by climate change. Increasingly extreme weather events, such as flooding and heatwaves, are damaging airports, bridges, and power grids that were not designed for current climate realities. According to climate analytics firm First Street, a significant percentage of power, telecommunications, and airport infrastructure faces major risk. Experts warn that a $3.7 trillion spending gap over the next decade must be addressed to make the nation's infrastructure resilient against these growing environmental threats.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" after a marathon session, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote in a 51-50 decision. The legislation, which makes permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term while cutting social programs, now returns to the House for approval of the Senate's changes. Its passage remains uncertain due to opposition from some conservative Republicans over its impact on the national deficit. The bill's passage in the Senate is a key step, but it faces a difficult path to become law by the president's July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

The move follows a call from a Republican congressman to revoke Mamdani's citizenship, alleging he may have concealed support for "terrorism" during his naturalization process, citing a rap song. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that if the claims are true, they should be investigated. The threat of denaturalization comes amid a broader administration policy to prioritize stripping citizenship from foreign-born citizens convicted of certain crimes and has been condemned by critics as politically motivated.</p>

Independent analysts project the bill could add $3.3 trillion to the debt over a decade, but proponents argue that making the 2017 tax cuts permanent does not constitute new spending. This approach has been labeled "fakery" by Democrats and has raised alarms among some investors and fiscal analysts, who warn it could erode the country's fiscal health. The bill also includes a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling to avert a potential default this summer. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts recommend actively shopping around for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, before anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts further lower them.

          <p>Jimmy Swaggart, the fire-and-brimstone Pentecostal preacher who built a global media empire in the 1980s, has died at age 90. At his peak, his television ministry reached millions and brought in over $100 million annually, funding a massive compound in Baton Rouge. However, his career was derailed by two separate sex scandals involving prostitutes, leading to his defrocking and the decline of his ministry. A cousin of rock-and-roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis, Swaggart was a dynamic showman who clawed his way back to the pulpit but never regained his former influence.</p>

          <h2>UK House Prices Experience Sharpest Monthly Decline in Over Two Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 11:33:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices saw their largest monthly drop since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This decline may reflect weakened demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made home purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate was still positive at 2.1%, though it was the slowest in nearly a year. Economists expect the housing market to stabilize and potentially pick up in the coming months, supported by low unemployment and the possibility of further interest rate cuts.

          <p>North Korean state media has released images of leader Kim Jong Un honoring the coffins of soldiers reportedly killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The broadcast, part of a gala marking a military pact with Russia, showed a visibly emotional Kim and featured images of troops on the battlefield. According to Western and South Korean intelligence, North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to support Russia's efforts in the Kursk region, with estimates of around 600 killed. The public tribute confirms North Korea's direct military involvement and casualties in the conflict, deepening its alliance with Russia.</p>
