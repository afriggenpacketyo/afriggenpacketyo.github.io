            <p>American pastor Josh Sullivan was rescued in South Africa after being abducted at gunpoint during a prayer meeting at his church. The rescue operation, led by a specialized police unit, involved a shootout that resulted in the deaths of three suspects. Sullivan, who arrived in South Africa with his family in 2018 to plant a church, was found unharmed and is in excellent condition.

            <p>ASML, a critical chip manufacturing firm, reported lower-than-expected net bookings, citing uncertainty from potential U.S. trade restrictions. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that tariffs are creating a new uncertainty regarding market demands, potentially affecting the company's full-year revenue guidance. While the demand outlook remains strong, driven by artificial intelligence, concerns linger about the broader impact of U.S. tariffs on the semiconductor supply chain. Nvidia also disclosed a $5.5 billion quarterly charge due to U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 graphics processing unit to China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to a surge in intense grass fires. Endangered species like hen harriers and water voles are particularly at risk, with significant habitat loss reported across the country. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures have contributed to the fires, which are largely human-caused. Conservation charities are calling for increased government funding to restore peat bogs and prevent future fires, emphasizing the devastating impact on already vulnerable ecosystems.</p>

Adelson's support for Donald Trump and Israel has also drawn criticism, with some finding it ironic that NBA owners often participate in political fundraising while remaining unbothered when players speak out on social issues.

Wage growth continues to outpace inflation, but experts predict inflation to fall to near its 2% target by 2026. The Bank of England may face pressure to cut interest rates, but strong wage growth could discourage such a move.</p>
