            <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was indicted in Manhattan federal court on charges including stalking, firearms offenses, and murder. Attorney General Pamela Bondi is seeking the death penalty, marking the first time it has been sought since the Biden administration's moratorium on federal executions. Mangione's attorney criticized the decision as political and barbaric, noting that it goes against the recommendation of local federal prosecutors. Mangione also faces murder and terrorism charges in Pennsylvania and New York.</p>

            <p>A wind project off the coast of Long Island has been halted by order of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, raising concerns about the future of clean energy initiatives. Equinor, the company operating the project, has suspended construction of Empire Wind 1, which was slated to power 500,000 homes. The decision has been criticized as politically motivated, with experts arguing the project underwent thorough environmental review.

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, has been postponed until May after a contentious day in court. Attorneys fought with prosecutors, leading to the delay as the judge considered requests from both sides. The hearing was intended to determine if the brothers should receive a new sentence potentially allowing their release after three decades in prison. The delay stems from a new risk assessment report ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom and a motion to recuse the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.</p>

            <p>Canada faces a severe housing affordability crisis, with home prices in major cities like Vancouver reaching exorbitant levels. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver is now over C$2 million. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage. With a federal election approaching, political parties are proposing plans to increase housing construction and improve affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly scrapped plans to offer additional assistance to Texas schools in curbing measles due to potential staff layoffs. This decision follows a record outbreak of the virus in Texas. The CDC had considered expanding its services to schools after conducting onsite assessments at hospitals to identify ventilation and air filtration issues. However, concerns about potential layoffs among key personnel have led to the cancellation of these plans.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike due to the removal of the Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO) role, which leads to pay cuts for some workers. The union claims some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council estimates the maximum loss would be just over £6,000. The dispute centers on the council's decision to reduce crew sizes and eliminate the higher-paid WRCO position. A consultation on compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff began on April 3.</p>
