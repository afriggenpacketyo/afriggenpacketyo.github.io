          <p>President Trump has terminated Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for DEI initiatives as inappropriate for her position. Sajet, appointed by former President Obama in 2013, had previously led the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Trump has consistently criticized the Smithsonian network as leftist and anti-American, signing an executive order in March to target funding for programs promoting what he deems divisive ideologies. Vice President JD Vance is tasked with overseeing the removal of such ideologies from the institution. This move follows Trump's earlier removal of leadership at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. The optimism score cannot be calculated.</p>

          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the U.S. despite a federal court decision that overturned many of Donald Trumpâ€™s tariffs. The UK aims to finalize deals covering sectors such as cars, metals, and airplane parts, with negotiators having spent the previous week in Washington discussing implementation. This decision comes even as a court ruling against Trump's tariffs is temporarily paused pending further review. The UK government believes the deals are crucial for protecting British businesses and jobs, and are striving for swift implementation.

          <p>An appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, keeping a California judge's order halting the downsizing in place. The court ruled that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution.

The judge questioned the legality of the administration's efforts to pare the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
