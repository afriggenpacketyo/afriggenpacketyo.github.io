          <h2>Trump Supporters Express Anger Over Justice Department Memo on Epstein Case</h2>

          <p>Supporters of President Trump are expressing significant anger and frustration following a Justice Department and FBI memo which stated no "client list" for Jeffrey Epstein was found. This has led to backlash against administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, with some prominent allies calling for her resignation. The memo contradicts previous suggestions by Bondi, creating a sense of betrayal and fueling accusations of a cover-up among Trump's base. This internal dissent marks a notable moment of criticism from some of the president's most loyal followers.</p>

          <p>Amazon has expanded its Prime Day sales event to four days, creating a significant midsummer shopping period that tests consumer spending habits amidst ongoing trade tariff uncertainty. Analysts predict record spending, particularly on electronics, as shoppers may be looking to purchase items before potential price hikes driven by tariffs on Chinese imports. While retailers have so far absorbed many of the tariff-related costs, the event serves as a key indicator of consumer resilience. The extended sale also helps Amazon compete with rivals like Walmart and Target, who have their own promotions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A roadside bomb in the northern Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of five Israeli Defense Forces soldiers and injured fourteen others on Monday. The incident occurred during an operation in the Beit Hanoun area, where troops came under fire while attempting to evacuate the wounded. This attack comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington, D.C., for high-level meetings regarding a potential ceasefire with Hamas. The IDF has identified the deceased soldiers and notified their families.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, citing the need for the country to defend itself against intensified Russian attacks. In a sharp turn of rhetoric, Trump expressed strong frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of being disingenuous and stating that his actions are "meaningless." This decision follows a recent phone call that reportedly disappointed Trump, signaling a potential shift in his administration's approach to the ongoing conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has responded by ordering his officials to intensify contacts with the U.S. to secure these critical military supplies.</p>

          <p>Five men have been convicted for their roles in an arson attack on a London warehouse that was sending communications equipment to Ukraine. The plot was orchestrated by a handler from the Russian mercenary Wagner Group via the Telegram app, who hired small-time British criminals for cash. The attack caused over £1m in damage and was part of a broader Wagner strategy to sow chaos and target entities supporting Ukraine. The case highlights Russia's evolving tactics of using local proxies for sabotage operations, a method police describe as a response to the UK becoming a "hostile operating environment" for traditional spies.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, chairman of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, compared the likelihood of tariffs causing significant price increases to rare events like "pandemics or meteors." Speaking on CNBC, Miran argued that despite widespread fears, there has been no evidence of broad inflation resulting from the administration's tariff policies thus far. He promoted a White House report showing that prices on imported goods actually fell between December and May. Economists, however, suggest that delays in implementation and corporate stockpiling are reasons why the full price impact has not yet been felt by consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The article contends that President Trump's month-long series of raids in the city are a political strategy to punish immigrant-friendly municipalities.

Despite a high-rate environment, the potential savings can be significant compared to average credit card APRs.

          <p>This article is an appreciation of the life and work of playwright Richard Greenberg, who passed away at age 67. Greenberg was celebrated for his witty, intelligent, and highly articulate dialogue, often compared to the prose of Henry James. His most acclaimed works include the Tony Award-winning "Take Me Out," about a gay baseball player, and the structurally inventive "Three Days of Rain." A prolific writer, he was known for creating complex characters who grappled with the past. He left a significant legacy, having crafted some of the most memorable roles and speeches in contemporary American theater.</p>

          <p>The death of former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit, just hours after being dismissed by the president, has shocked observers and is being viewed as a stark warning to Russia's political elite. While the Kremlin has commented little, speculation in the Russian press links his death to a fraud investigation concerning defensive fortifications built in the Kursk region while he was governor. Analysts suggest the event is reminiscent of the Stalinist era, where high-level officials saw no way out of the system. The incident underscores the increasing dangers faced by those who fall out of favor within the current Russian political structure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from UC San Diego reveals that feral western honeybees, which are not native to the Americas, are dominating ecosystems in Southern California and crowding out native pollinators. The study, conducted in a bee biodiversity hotspot, found that these feral honeybees now constitute about 90% of all bees in the area. Researchers observed that honeybees are so efficient at foraging that they can remove over 80% of a flower's pollen in a single day, leaving little for native species like bumblebees. This raises concerns about the health of native plant communities and suggests a need to manage honeybee populations.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that France and the UK "will deliver" on stopping small boat crossings in the English Channel, ahead of talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The negotiations are expected to focus on a new border enforcement deal, potentially including a "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement and new powers for French police to intercept boats in shallow waters. Addressing the UK Parliament, Macron emphasized that while joint efforts are being increased, a lasting solution will require action at the European level.

          <p>A recent Social Security Administration communication misleadingly claimed that President Trump's new tax legislation eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for nearly 90% of seniors. Tax experts clarify this is inaccurate; the bill does not eliminate the tax but provides an enhanced deduction of up to $6,000 for those 65 and older. This new deduction can reduce the amount of taxable income, which may in turn lower the portion of Social Security benefits subject to tax for some middle-income seniors. However, it does not apply to everyone and will not wipe out the tax liability for most who currently pay it. (not investment advice)</p>

Stewart and guest Steve Kroft characterized the payment as a "shakedown" and "protection money" intended to ensure regulatory approval for Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media. Trump had sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, claiming it was unfavorably edited. Stewart highlighted the apparent hypocrisy by showing a more egregious edit of a Trump interview on Fox News, questioning why one merited a massive settlement.</p>
