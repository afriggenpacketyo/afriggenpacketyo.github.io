          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intensified his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns about the central bank's political independence. The criticism has fueled market speculation that Trump could attempt to install a "shadow chair" to influence monetary policy before Powell's term officially ends. Despite the political pressure, Fed officials maintain that their decisions on interest rates are based on economic data, not partisan politics, and are aimed at managing inflation and employment.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has partially stayed lower court injunctions against President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, narrowing their scope. The ruling does not address the constitutionality of the order itself but limits the power of individual district judges to issue nationwide blocks on executive actions. This allows the administration to proceed with developing its policy, though it remains blocked for the specific plaintiffs who sued, while the broader legal and constitutional questions remain unresolved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is being analyzed as a narrow, procedural victory for President Trump rather than a full endorsement of his birthright citizenship policy. This article explains that the ruling leaves the door open for future challenges, including class-action lawsuits, and may even benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in the power of single judges. The opinion focuses on the principle that judicial relief should be tailored to the specific plaintiffs in a case, creating a more complex legal landscape.</p>

          <p>A major fire erupted aboard a cargo ship carrying scrap metal at Albert Dock in Hull, UK, prompting a large-scale emergency response. Fire crews battled the blaze as a massive plume of smoke spread across the city, leading to the closure of nearby roads, shops, and a local festival. All people on board the vessel were accounted for and safe, but residents were advised to keep windows and doors closed due to the smoke.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, a multi-billion-dollar program that subsidizes phone and internet access for rural communities, low-income households, schools, and libraries. In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a challenge that argued Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC. This ruling ensures the continuation of a program that has worked for decades to expand telecommunications access across the country.</p>
