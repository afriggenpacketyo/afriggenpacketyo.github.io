          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the recent upper house election, marking the first time his Liberal Democratic Party lost a majority in both houses since 1955. Despite this significant electoral setback, Ishiba has committed to staying on to navigate critical trade negotiations with the United States, particularly concerning looming tariffs. The election also saw a surge in support for the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which gained 14 seats with its "Japanese First" rhetoric and anti-immigration stance. This political landscape presents a challenging path for Ishiba's administration as it seeks to address public discontent over inflation and political scandals.</p>

          <p>A vehicle intentionally plowed into a crowd outside a Los Angeles nightclub on Santa Monica Boulevard, injuring 30 people, with seven in critical condition. The driver, Fernando Ramirez, made a U-turn before the crash and was subsequently attacked by bystanders and shot before police arrived. Authorities are investigating both the crash as an intentional act and the shooting of the driver as a separate crime. The incident, which also involved a taco truck and valet stand, occurred as people waited to enter a reggae/hip hop event, prompting a large emergency response and a statement from Mayor Karen Bass.</p>

          <p>Adolfo "Fito" Macias, a prominent Ecuadorian drug trafficker and leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, has been extradited to the United States to face charges including cocaine distribution and firearms violations. This extradition marks a historic first for Ecuador, following Macias's recapture after a January 2024 prison escape that prompted President Daniel Noboa to declare a state of "internal armed conflict." Macias's gang is implicated in smuggling firearms from the U.S. into Ecuador and cocaine into Mexico, highlighting Ecuador's growing role as a major transit point in the global cocaine trade.</p>

          <p>Drake Bell, known from "Drake & Josh," has accused Nickelodeon of not paying residuals to its child stars, claiming he and co-star Josh Peck never received payments for their show's continued use. Bell stated that while other networks pay residuals for re-runs, Nickelodeon offers only a one-time payment, despite shows like "Drake & Josh" remaining popular on multiple platforms. He criticized this practice as exploitative, alleging that "evil, corrupt people" at Viacom profit immensely from child labor without fair compensation. This revelation follows Bell's previous disclosures about sexual assault he experienced while working for the network, adding to scrutiny of Nickelodeon's past practices.</p>

          <p>China is significantly outpacing the United States in the development and investment of renewable energy, a crucial aspect of the ongoing technological rivalry between the two global powers. As the demand for electricity surges due to advancements in artificial intelligence and data centers, China is prioritizing clean energy goals and boosting related investments. In contrast, the Trump administration is reportedly canceling tax credits for renewable sources like wind and solar, citing concerns about grid reliability. This divergence in policy highlights differing national approaches to energy and climate issues, with China positioning itself for a global tech lead through sustainable energy initiatives.</p>

Other factors include foreign companies investing in the U.S., massive infrastructure needs for data centers and energy, relaxed bank stress tests allowing more lending, and a renewed U.S. energy sector.

Simultaneously, the survey highlights a strong public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices and inflation, with nearly two-thirds disapproving of Trump's handling of inflation.

This decision fulfills a Labour manifesto pledge, aiming to provide answers for those affected who have sought justice for over 40 years. The Orgreave Justice Campaign expressed "cautious elation" at the news, emphasizing the long-fought battle for truth.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent British Open victory has solidified his status as the most dominant golfer since Tiger Woods, with striking similarities in their early major championship trajectories. Scheffler's machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments, along with his improved putting, have led to four major wins in four seasons, including the 2022 and 2023 Masters and the 2024 US PGA Championship. Despite Scheffler's humility regarding the comparisons, peers and commentators recognize his "Tiger-like" ability to imperiously tear through fields, making him the undisputed world number one. His success underscores a new era of golfing excellence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), its primary scientific research arm, as part of a plan to cut 23% of the EPA's staff.

However, critics like Democratic Rep.

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned concertgoers about appearing on the Jumbotron during their "Jumbotron Song" at a recent show, advising them to "do your makeup now."

The incident sparked widespread internet memes and a company investigation into conduct and accountability. Coldplay has not directly addressed the fallout, but Martin's new pre-song message indicates an awareness of the public's heightened scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A child development expert, having studied over 200 parent-child relationships, identifies "self-connection"—the ability to tune into one's own emotions and inner voice—as the single most crucial skill for a child's success and well-being. The article explains that subtle, well-meaning parental responses can inadvertently erode this connection, leading to anxiety and insecurity. It advocates for validating children's emotions, welcoming their full selves, avoiding micromanagement, and modeling self-connection as key strategies. By fostering this internal trust, children develop emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, authentic confidence, and stronger mental health, enabling them to navigate life's challenges more effectively.</p>

He anticipates an extension of the 90-day tariff pause, noting that a return to higher tariffs is undesirable for both nations. Stein suggests that China's recent restriction of fentanyl precursors might lead to the U.S. lowering its related tariffs, potentially paving the way for a more normalized trade relationship. However, he emphasizes the business community's ongoing concern that trade policy remains dominated by tariff issues, creating uncertainty for companies navigating the complex US-China relationship.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 trials at Guantanamo Bay face increased uncertainty after plea deals for the defendants, including alleged ringleader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were canceled. These deals would have allowed them to avoid the death penalty in exchange for guilty pleas, offering a potential path to closure. Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck notes that the cancellation, particularly due to an overruling by former General Lloyd Austin, will likely trigger more litigation and further prolong the process. This development frustrates 9/11 family members seeking justice and closure, as the capital nature of the charges ensures years of additional pretrial disputes and appeals, with a trial still years away.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a medical center on Long Island, New York, while wearing a heavy metallic necklace. The incident occurred when the man, reportedly called into the room by his wife after her scan, entered without permission while the powerful MRI machine was running. The strong magnetic field attracted the metal, causing him to be drawn into the machine, resulting in a fatal medical episode. This tragic event underscores the critical importance of strict safety protocols for MRI environments, where metallic objects can become dangerous projectiles due to intense magnetic forces.</p>
