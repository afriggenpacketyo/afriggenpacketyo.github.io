He revered capitalism's institutions and treated shareholders' duty as a sacred trust, earning him comparisons to J.P. Morgan Sr. for his integrity. The article emphasizes Buffett's ability to look past short-term distractions and engage within his circle of competence, making him an irreplaceable figure in American capitalism. </p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by allegedly using his campaign website to signal strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as 'red-boxing,' involves publicly posting instructions that independent expenditure groups can then act upon, effectively coordinating strategy while circumventing direct communication prohibitions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about the new rules targeting red-boxing, and a Cuomo opponent has requested an investigation. Cuomo's campaign denies any wrongdoing, asserting that no independent expenditure acted on the information provided on the website.</p>

The skull also has greenish discoloration, likely from a metal crown, and physical features that match what is known about Corvinus.

Senators are particularly concerned about a $2 billion deposit deal secured by a Trump-affiliated crypto firm from an Emirati venture fund, viewing it as a conflict of interest and a form of corruption.

          <p>India is facing concerns about Chinese 'dumping' of goods, particularly viscose yarn, as trade tensions with the US escalate. Cheaper Chinese imports are flooding Indian ports, impacting local producers and causing production slowdowns. Despite assurances from China, anxieties about dumping are spreading across sectors in India. The Indian trade ministry has established a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods and has imposed taxes on some steel imports to protect local industries.</p>

          <p>A fatal plane crash in Simi Valley involving a kit-built aircraft has raised questions about the safety and regulatory approval process of these experimental planes. The single-engine Vans RV-10 crashed into homes, killing two passengers and a dog. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash, which is the second in five months involving that model aircraft. Kit planes are popular due to their lower cost, but they require rigorous inspection and testing before passengers are allowed.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding an inspector general investigation into the FAA due to ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, citing air traffic controller shortages and equipment outages. The problems, which have led to hundreds of delays and cancellations, have prompted United Airlines to cut flights. Schumer pointed to issues such as a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors to the chaos. The FAA acknowledges the antiquated air traffic control system and is working to improve reliability.</p>

The administration is portraying its efforts as necessary for national security, despite facing legal setbacks and criticism for undermining the independence of the judiciary.

The move comes amid concerns that scientists could create more dangerous pathogens in labs. The executive order would block U.S. funding for such research in "countries of concern," such as China and Iran, and empower research agencies to identify and end funding for biological research that could pose a threat to American public health.</p>
