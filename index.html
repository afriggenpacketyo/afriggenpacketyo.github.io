            <p>Amid trade wars and economic uncertainty, consumers are considering how to spend and save money, potentially driving more people to shop secondhand. While tariffs are expected to increase the price of goods, savvy shoppers may turn to thrift stores and online retailers like Poshmark and ThredUp. However, experts caution that the secondhand market may not be immune to tariff impacts, as tighter times could limit the supply of secondhand clothing. Ultimately, economic pressures may force people to rethink their shopping habits and consider more sustainable options.</p>

            <p>Advocates for academic freedom are bracing for a potential overhaul of the system accrediting institutions of higher learning. President Trump has expressed intentions to use accreditation as a "secret weapon" against colleges he views as too progressive. Actions could include giving states the authority to approve institutions for federal aid, bypassing accreditors. Project 2025 outlines ways to prohibit accreditors from requiring diversity policies or enforcing standards that undermine religious beliefs.</p>

This decision follows the near-elimination of the Institute of Library and Museum Services (IMLS) by the Trump administration.

The deletion is seen as the beginning of cuts if libraries are not fully funded, potentially impacting access to resources and interlibrary loan programs.</p>

The factors present risk, but also a lot of opportunity, said Michelle McKenna, a senior advisor in Evercore's strategic advisory practice. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The most severe animal welfare problem in today's meat industry is the genetic manipulation of farmed animals, particularly chickens. Chickens have been bred to grow as big as possible in as little time as possible, leading to health problems like lameness and heart failure. This rapid growth takes an enormous toll on the chickens’ bodies. While many food companies have pledged to buy meat from slower-growing chickens in the US, few have followed through, though there has been some progress in Europe.</p>

Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens. The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya. Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct, however some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.</p>

The EU has long alleged that Beijing subsidizes key sectors such as electric vehicles, batteries and steel and aluminum in a way that is harmful to global markets and competitiveness.</p>

Since its collapse, California’s sunflower sea star population hasn’t meaningfully bounced back on its own.
