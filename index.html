        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After three trials, Dana Chandler was found guilty of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, maintaining her innocence throughout the process. The case involved circumstantial evidence, including recorded conversations with her daughter and a history of stalking behavior towards Sisco. The prosecution argued that Chandler was obsessed with Sisco and killed him and Harkness out of jealousy and rage, while the defense pointed to the lack of physical evidence linking her to the crime scene. Despite a previous conviction being overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, the third trial resulted in a guilty verdict, bringing some closure to the families of the victims.</p>

          <p>A history enthusiast using a metal detector led archaeologists to the site of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, after noticing a strange symbol on an 18th-century map. The surveyor had marked the location as "Klosterkullen," or "monastery hill," on a 1760 map. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of walls and structures beneath the surface, leading to the discovery of walls roughly 6.5 feet thick, believed to be the remains of pillar foundations. Experts speculate the monastery may be the original site of Ã…s Abbey, dating back to the late 1100s.</p>

          <p>Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles has urged China to provide transparency and reassurance regarding its "extraordinary military build-up," citing it as a fundamental issue for the region. Speaking at an Asian defense summit in Singapore, Marles emphasized the need for China to clarify its strategic intent and demonstrate compliance with international law. He contrasted Australia's open defense strategy with China's lack of transparency, noting that Australia makes public its national defense strategy and reviews, and makes it "utterly clear" that when they build up their defenses it is for Australia and Asia's security.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe find greater meaning in life compared to those without children, but they often experience lower life satisfaction. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveals that this satisfaction level is influenced by factors such as living situation and family policy. Mothers, in particular, tend to report lower life satisfaction than fathers, and Scandinavian countries show smaller differences between parents and child-free individuals due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies. The study highlights the importance of societal support in easing the challenges of parenthood.</p>

          <p>Public debate is growing in China regarding the practice of reinstating or promoting officials who were previously disciplined for misconduct. The case of Xie Qin, a township party chief being considered for promotion after a drinking spree incident, has sparked frustration among the public. This trend is part of Beijing's effort to incentivize officials amid the anti-corruption campaign and economic challenges. However, many view it as rewarding misconduct and undermining the credibility of the system, particularly given the focus on economic success for continued Communist Party control.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, with experts attributing the trend to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation has reduced citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of processed foods with low nutritional value. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but it has faced criticism for overlooking broader economic struggles and stigmatizing overweight individuals. Experts advocate for measures such as a nationwide free school meal program and stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing to address the issue effectively.</p>

This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling on the legal definition of a woman being based on biological sex. Billie Sky, affected by the ban, can no longer play for her team, London Galaxy, though she can still play informally for Goal Diggers FC, which withdrew from FA-affiliated leagues in response to the new policy.

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump's inconsistent approach to China, combining aggression with weakness, increases the likelihood of a war over Taiwan. Trump's punitive tariffs and discriminatory curbs on technology exports are seen as provocative, potentially pushing Xi Jinping to call Trump's bluff. The author suggests that Trump's policies, driven by self-interest and fear, create a vulnerable situation for Taiwan, while his isolationist tendencies and disruption of alliances embolden China. The article concludes that the US now looks beatable, creating an opportunity for China to take Taiwan.</p>
