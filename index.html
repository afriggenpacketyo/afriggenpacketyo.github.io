          <h2>New Regulations Mandate Solar Panels for Most New Homes in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 19:59:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is set to introduce regulations requiring developers to install solar panels on the "vast majority" of new build homes in England. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the move is "just common sense" and would save households £500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of 1.5 million new homes by 2029. While developers will be required to add panels unless buildings fall under certain exemptions, local authorities will need to be vigilant to ensure compliance with the new rules.</p>

          <p>A bitter feud has erupted between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, escalating from disagreements over legislation to personal attacks.

This public falling out follows Musk's previous role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

The ICC responded by stating it "deplores" the sanctions, viewing them as an attempt to undermine its independence. The sanctions are a response to the ICC's arrest warrants for top Israeli officials and its investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>

If the measure stands, it would affect thousands of students scheduled to attend the university for summer and fall terms.

          <p>The public falling out between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has culminated in personal attacks and accusations, marking the end of a once-strong alliance. The feud began over disagreements about Trump's domestic policy priorities, leading to threats from Trump to cut off Musk's government contracts. Musk responded by claiming Trump appears in government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, escalating the conflict. The relationship, which saw Musk become a prominent Republican donor and advisor, has deteriorated rapidly, raising questions about the future of their interactions.</p>

The justices rejected the view that "members of a majority group" must present more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a discrimination lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who claimed she was demoted by a lesbian supervisor. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against any individual based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex, including sexual orientation.</p>
