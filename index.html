          <p>The European Union is reportedly drafting "precise plans" to potentially send troops to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees, according to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. These plans, agreed upon during a meeting involving US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would include support from the United States, including intelligence and surveillance assets. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that Germany is bracing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, indicating a lack of optimism for a swift resolution in 2025. This multinational troop deployment is intended to provide security for Ukraine after the war with Russia concludes. The article highlights the EU's proactive measures to ensure stability in the region. </p>

The Cowboys received the Packers' next two first-round picks and All-Pro defensive tackle Kenny Clark in exchange for Parsons.

          <p>A private survey indicated that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index reached 50.5, exceeding economists' estimates. This signals the fastest expansion rate since March, rebounding from July's contraction. However, China's official manufacturing PMI showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction, coming in at 49.4. </p>

          <p>The Philippines is grappling with a rise in pregnancies among girls aged 10-14, sparking a debate over sex education in the deeply Catholic nation. Lawmakers, health experts, and church groups are divided on the future of sex education, with a bill aimed at standardizing comprehensive sexuality education facing opposition. Conservative organizations argue that CSE normalizes sexual discussion, conflicting with Filipino culture. The Catholic Church believes intercourse should only occur between married couples and disapproves of artificial contraception, making the debate highly contentious. </p>
