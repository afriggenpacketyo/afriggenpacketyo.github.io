            <p>Harriet Dart, a British tennis player, has issued an apology for asking the umpire to tell her French opponent, Lois Boisson, to wear deodorant during their match at the Rouen Open. Dart made the comment during a changeover in the second set, which was caught on the broadcast. Dart stated that it was a heat-of-the-moment comment and that she takes full responsibility for her actions. Dart acknowledged that this is not how she wants to conduct herself and that she respects Lois and how she competed. </p>

            <p>A civil case against Andrew Tate, brought by four women accusing him of rape, assault, and coercive control, is believed to be a legal first, according to the women's barrister. The women are seeking damages for the alleged assaults and intentional infliction of harm. Anne Studd KC argues that coercive control amounted to "intentional infliction of harm", which could lead to additional damages. Tate denies the claims, calling them "gross fabrications" and a "pack of lies," while his solicitor argues the claims are time-barred. </p>

King described the experience as "oddly quiet" and "peaceful," and said looking down at Earth was a reminder of the need to "do better, be better."

The squid, measuring about one foot in length, was captured on camera by an underwater vehicle operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute. The footage allows scientists to gather more information about the behavior of colossal squids during the early stages of life, as little is known about their diet, lifespan, or reproductive traits due to their elusive nature.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County is facing unprecedented financial challenges due to costs from wildfires and a $4 billion sex abuse case settlement. The region faces roughly $2 billion in expenses related to January's fires and the settlement will impact the budget for decades. The potential loss of federal funding and slower property tax revenue growth have added to the county's challenges. The county is expected to cut its budget by nearly $90 million and eliminate vacant positions.</p>

Zuckerberg was questioned about his motivations for acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, purchases the federal government says cemented Meta's status as a monopoly. Meta's attorneys argue that the company's services face plenty of competition from popular platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Snap and others.</p>

            <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from immediately revoking the deportation protections and work permits of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The administration had planned to terminate the legal status of those migrants on April 24, but the judge suspended the deportation warnings. The ruling is a reprieve for those who arrived under a policy the Biden administration argued promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration has argued that those allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV initiative were not properly vetted.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's drive to carry out the largest campaign in history has ensnared people who didn’t see themselves as targets. The administration is expanding deportation efforts beyond those with serious criminal records, targeting immigrants with American-born children, no criminal record, and a history of paying taxes. Some of the president’s most influential supporters have criticized the arrests of some noncriminal immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently announced that all immigrants without legal status must register with the government or face criminal consequences.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would only consider this for Americans who are the most violent, egregious repeat offenders of crime. The Trump administration has already deported more than 200 people, most of them without criminal records, to El Salvador with no due process. Maryland construction builder Kilmar Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, a prison notorious for human rights abuses, in what the U.S. government later called an “administrative error.”</p>
