          <p>China has reportedly sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, urging coordinated action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies as trade tensions escalate between the two largest economies. The letter, delivered by the Chinese Ambassador, likely seeks Japan's support in opposing protectionism, but Japan, a close U.S. ally, is expected to respond cautiously. This move comes amidst broader concerns about the global economic and security situation, as Japan focuses on strengthening ties with Southeast Asian nations in response to uncertainties sparked by U.S. trade policies.

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, primarily driven by increases in food and private transport costs.

These figures come as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a key concern.
