          <p>Intel's stock fell by 9% following an announcement that it will significantly cut costs in its foundry business. Despite beating earnings estimates, the company expressed uncertainty about its ability to secure major external customers for its advanced chip manufacturing processes. In response to these struggles and past over-investment, Intel is canceling facility projects in Europe and slowing production in Ohio. The company also confirmed it may discontinue the foundry business if it fails to secure a key customer for its next-generation technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he has not thought about pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking crimes. His comments came as Maxwell was meeting with a top Department of Justice official. Trump deflected further questions about his own past association with Epstein, suggesting focus should be on others like Bill Clinton. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed that no clemency offers have been made in exchange for her cooperation with the DOJ, where she has been answering questions for two days.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by revenue from his administration's tariffs. He suggested the payments could be targeted toward individuals below a certain income level, though specifics were not provided. This proposal comes as the national debt is projected to rise, and Trump also mentioned paying down debt as a priority for the tariff funds. The federal government has collected approximately $100 billion in tariff revenue this year, which is paid by U.S. importers and can impact consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being available for two decades, in-flight Wi-Fi remains notoriously unreliable, creating a frustrating limbo for travelers. The core issue is not the Wi-Fi signal within the plane but the connection to the internet, which relies on either older, slower air-to-ground technology or newer, better satellite systems. While major airlines like Delta and American are upgrading their fleets to satellite service, many regional and short-haul jets still use the inferior system, leading to inconsistent experiences. Airlines now view reliable Wi-Fi as a core product, not an amenity, but full fleet-wide implementation of high-quality service is still projected to be years away.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan youth baseball team has been forced to miss the Senior League Baseball World Series after being denied visas to enter the United States. The Cacique Mara team, comprised of players aged 13-16, had won the Latin American championship to qualify for the tournament in South Carolina. Little League International expressed disappointment, calling the situation an injustice to the young athletes. The team's president stated they were told the denial was due to U.S. travel restrictions on Venezuela, which the Trump administration cites as a national security concern. A team from Mexico will now take their place.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread reports of catastrophic hunger in Gaza, a formal famine has not been declared due to a specific, internationally agreed-upon system. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) requires three strict criteria to be met: at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, 30% of children suffering acute malnutrition, and a death rate of at least two adults per 10,000 people per day from non-trauma causes. While Gaza is currently in phase four ("emergency"), collecting reliable data, especially on mortality in a conflict zone, is challenging. Experts warn that people are already dying from hunger-related causes long before the technical threshold for a famine declaration is met.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has issued new guidance stating that single adult male asylum seekers who refuse to move from hotels to other designated accommodations could have their financial support withdrawn and risk becoming homeless. The government claims hundreds of migrants are refusing such transfers weekly, undermining the efficiency of the asylum system. This policy is part of a broader effort to reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers, which peaked at over 50,000 people in 2023. Critics argue the government should focus on processing claims faster and allowing asylum seekers to work to reduce accommodation needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While 0% balance transfer credit cards can be a powerful tool for managing high-interest debt, failing to pay off the balance before the promotional period ends can have severe financial consequences. Once the introductory offer expires, the card’s standard annual percentage rate (APR), often 18% or higher, is applied to the remaining balance. Some cards may even charge deferred interest, retroactively applying interest from the original transfer date, which can erase any savings. To avoid this, consumers should create a strict payoff plan and consider other debt relief options if the balance is overwhelming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times gives President Trump's second administration high marks for its first six months, characterizing the period as fast-paced and effective. The author gives an "A+" for immigration, citing historically low border crossings, and an "A" for domestic policy, praising actions against the administrative state and "diversity, equity, and inclusion" initiatives. The economy receives a "B+", acknowledging a strong stock market and new trade deals but noting stubbornly high inflation and rising debt. The piece concludes that while there is more work to do, the administration is off to a very strong start from a conservative perspective.</p>

The court heard that the attackers, who had previous convictions for carrying knives, boarded the bus and purposefully targeted their victim.

          <p>The Thai government has declared martial law in eight districts along its border with Cambodia as deadly clashes between the two nations continue. The fighting, which stems from a long-running border dispute, has intensified with the use of jets, artillery, and ground troops. The conflict has already killed at least 19 people in Thailand and led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from both sides of the border. In response to the escalating violence, the United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>This article provides a timeline of the key legal events in the decades-long case of Jeffrey Epstein, from the first police investigation in 2005 to his death in 2019. It details the controversial 2007 non-prosecution agreement granted by federal prosecutors in Florida, which gave immunity to Epstein and his co-conspirators. The timeline also covers the civil lawsuits brought by victims, the defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell, and the investigative reporting that led to renewed public interest. It culminates with Epstein's 2019 arrest on federal sex trafficking charges and his subsequent death in custody, which has fueled ongoing calls for transparency.</p>

          <p>Immigration experts and attorneys highlight that the common refrain for immigrants to "get in line" ignores the reality of a backlogged and nearly impossible legal immigration system. For people from certain countries like Mexico, the wait for a family-sponsored green card can span decades, with some applicants dying before their case is heard. This mismatch between the U.S. economy's demand for labor and the restrictive legal pathways creates a system that incentivizes unauthorized immigration. While new legislative proposals aim to provide a path to citizenship for long-term residents, comprehensive immigration reform has failed for decades, leaving millions in a precarious legal limbo.</p>

Thorpe, 55, died after being struck by a train in August 2024. The inquest heard that weeks before his death, Thorpe's wife had told his care team he was asking for help to end his life, yet he was not deemed to be in a crisis situation. The coroner stated that while there were failings, such as not seeing Thorpe in person for months, it could not be determined if a different outcome was possible.</p>

Obama's office has dismissed the accusations as a "weak attempt at distraction" from the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.
