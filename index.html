          <p>A 37-year-old Massachusetts woman, Bethany Abigail Terrill, has been federally charged with threatening to kill U.S. officials. The incident occurred as she allegedly interfered with an immigration arrest outside a Boston-area courthouse, where she was verbally abusive and physically obstructive. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Terrill shouted, "We're coming for you, gonna kill you," a threat captured on body cameras, and now faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Debt settlement programs can offer relief by negotiating unsecured debts like credit card balances for less than the full amount owed, but many types of debt do not qualify. Generally, secured debts such as mortgages and auto loans are excluded because lenders can repossess the collateral. Additionally, government-backed obligations like federal student loans, tax debts, child support, and court-ordered fines are typically ineligible for these programs, requiring alternative solutions like bankruptcy or specialized repayment plans.

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans for a large, classical-style arch to be built in Washington, D.C., potentially to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year. Renderings show a monument similar to Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which would be located in a traffic circle near the Lincoln Memorial. The President displayed models of the proposed structure at a fundraising dinner, expressing a preference for the largest version, though the project's approval by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts is pending.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated his determination to secure the return of 19 deceased hostages still held in Gaza, following the handover of two more bodies by Hamas. The return is part of a ceasefire deal, but delays have caused anger in Israel. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump warned of potential renewed military action if violence from Hamas continues. The situation remains tense as Israel threatens to restrict aid to Gaza if the remaining bodies are not returned.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. cybersecurity company F5 dropped 12% after it revealed a significant security breach by what it described as a "highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor."

The breach prompted an emergency directive from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), urging all federal agencies to apply security updates immediately.</p>

          <p>California has joined a coalition of nearly two dozen states in suing the Trump administration over the cancellation of the $7 billion "Solar for All" grant program. The lawsuit alleges that the Environmental Protection Agency unlawfully terminated the program, which was designed to help over 900,000 low-income households nationwide install residential solar panels. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta argued the move breaches contractual obligations and denies states critical funds for advancing clean energy and lowering utility bills for vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>Sir Mark Rowley, the Commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, has vowed to be "ruthless" in removing rogue officers from the force.

          <p>The potential U.S. supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine has become a significant point of discussion, with President Zelenskyy believing they could pressure Russia towards peace. These long-range, high-accuracy missiles can fly at very low altitudes, making them difficult for Russian air defense systems like the S-400 to intercept, as demonstrated in past strikes in Syria. While the missiles could allow Ukraine to strike key military targets deep inside Russia, their high cost and limited production rates mean Kyiv would likely receive a relatively small number.</p>

          <p>This editorial argues that the Trump administration is escalating military threats against Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, under the guise of a "war on drugs." The piece highlights recent extrajudicial killings at sea, the buildup of U.S. forces in the region, and President Trump's confirmation of covert CIA operations. The author suggests this aggressive stance, championed by hawkish figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, may be an attempt to force regime change, though it risks backfiring given the U.S.'s history of failed interventions in Latin America.</p>

However, Polis distances himself from MAHA's anti-vaccine elements, recently countering federal policy to ensure vaccine access, creating a complex political position that other Democrats have yet to navigate.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's new film "Frankenstein" is being hailed as a career-best, passionately adapting Mary Shelley's novel for the modern era. The review highlights Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Victor Frankenstein as an arrogant, 1850s version of a Silicon Valley tech bro, whose creation (played by Jacob Elordi) is more a product of ego than scientific curiosity. The film powerfully critiques the shortsightedness of inventors who prioritize innovation over consequence, framing the classic horror story as a timeless warning about unchecked ambition and artificial intelligence.</p>
