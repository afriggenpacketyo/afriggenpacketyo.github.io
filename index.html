          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its AI model Claude constitutes "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models (LLMs) did not reproduce the creative elements or identifiable expressive style of the copyrighted works. The ruling is a significant victory for AI companies amidst ongoing legal battles over the use of copyrighted material in AI development. This decision begins to define the legal boundaries for the AI industry regarding the use of copyrighted works for training purposes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans to finalize and pass the megabill aimed at funding his second-term agenda, insisting that no one should go on vacation until the deal is completed. The bill seeks to make the Trump 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase funding for border security and the Department of Defense, and scale back Medicaid and SNAP benefits. A recent poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of the public views the bill unfavorably, especially concerning its impact on healthcare. Senate Republicans are working to comply with budget reconciliation rules to pass the bill with a simple majority.</p>

          <p>A court in Nantes, France, ruled that the French government bears partial responsibility for the 2016 death of a jogger who died after inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting algae on a beach in Brittany.

The Auffray family will receive compensation, though the court noted the jogger put himself at risk.

He reaffirmed the Fed's stance of maintaining interest rates due to low employment and growing wages. President Trump has criticized Powell and pressed for faster rate cuts to stimulate the economy.
