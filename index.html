          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports to the U.S. and a 40% tariff on transshipped goods.

While Trump stated Vietnam would pay the duty, tariffs are typically borne by U.S. importers, potentially increasing costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's vehicle deliveries fell by 13% in the last quarter, reaching 384,122 units, marking a continued decline. This downturn is attributed to heightened competition from other major manufacturers and startups, plateauing demand for electric vehicles, and brand damage linked to Elon Musk's political involvement. The company's resale value has also dropped significantly, with Model S and Model Y prices decreasing by about 16% year-over-year. Despite these challenges, Tesla is increasingly focusing its future on self-driving technology and robotaxi operations.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, owner of Modelo and Corona, reported a 2% drop in beer sales last quarter, partly due to President Trump's deportations and broader consumer economic anxieties.

The company's earnings and revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates, also impacted by higher aluminum costs from Trump's tariffs.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's plan to significantly restrict access to the nation's asylum system, siding with asylum-seekers and immigrants' rights groups. The ruling states that neither federal immigration law nor the Constitution grants the president "unilateral authority" to limit asylum rights or create an alternative immigration system. This decision is a blow to the administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, which began on Trump's first day in office. The judge's order is delayed by 14 days to allow the administration to appeal.</p>

          <p>CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, settled a private lawsuit with Donald Trump for $16 million over a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. This settlement, which Trump's team hailed as a win against "Fake News," is seen by critics as another instance of a major media outlet bowing to political pressure. Legal experts largely view Trump's claims as spurious and protected by the First Amendment. The move has sparked concerns about journalistic integrity and press freedom, with some calling it a form of "extortion" given Trump's influence.</p>

A provision in the bill targets healthcare non-profits that offer abortions and receive substantial federal funding. This could force nearly 200 health centers to close, disproportionately affecting clinics in states that protect abortion rights and medically underserved areas. Critics argue this is a direct attack on the healthcare safety net, impacting over a million patients who rely on Planned Parenthood for various services.</p>
