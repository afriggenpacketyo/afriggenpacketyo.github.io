          <p>Pakistan reports that India launched missiles at three of its air bases, prompting retaliatory strikes on Indian air bases and a missile storage facility, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nations. The Pakistani military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target Indian missile storage facilities and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur. Tensions have been soaring since an attack at a tourist site in Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, with India blaming Pakistan for backing the assault, which Islamabad denies. The Group of Seven nations urged "maximum restraint" from both countries, warning that further military escalation poses a serious threat to regional stability.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for crucial trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war. These meetings, the first since increased tariffs were imposed, seek to address the economic tensions impacting global supply chains and consumer costs. While expectations for a significant breakthrough are tempered, the initiation of high-level talks offers a glimmer of hope for tempering rhetoric and averting further hostilities. The Trump administration has accused China of unfairly subsidizing key sectors and failing to curb fentanyl exports, while China insists on equality and mutual respect in negotiations.</p>

          <p>For years, China's leader, Xi Jinping, has been strategically positioning the nation to become indispensable to the global economy through its exports and technological prowess. This approach involves dominating key supply chains and leveraging economic tools to counter foreign pressures. However, this strategy has costs, including strained relationships with trading partners and economic challenges for Chinese households. As the trade war with the U.S. escalates, China's willingness to weaponize its supply chain highlights a significant shift in its global posture, challenging the economic supremacy of the United States.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing staff cuts as part of the Trump administration's initiative to reduce its workforce by 15%, prompting concerns about the potential impact on veteran healthcare. While VA Secretary Doug Collins insists that frontline healthcare will not be affected, critics argue that achieving the stated workforce reduction goals without impacting care is impossible. VA staff and veterans are worried about existing shortages of medical providers and the mental stress on employees unsure of their job status, which could indirectly affect patient care. Despite assurances from the VA, a recent poll indicates that a majority of veterans are concerned about the potential impact of the cuts on their benefits and healthcare.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a tropical island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a prime shopping destination to benefit from the intensifying trade war between the U.S. and China.

The island hopes to attract Chinese shoppers seeking cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics, potentially boosting its tourism sector amid sluggish domestic consumption. This strategic move underscores China's efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the trade war by promoting domestic consumption and tourism in designated regions.</p>

The plan includes maintaining lower individual income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, alongside temporary boosts to the child tax credit. However, the legislation faces opposition from Democrats, who criticize the proposed cuts to programs for the poor to finance tax benefits for the wealthy. With a narrow majority in the House, Republicans face a challenging path to passing the legislation, which also requires Senate approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, via email. The decision has sparked criticism, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries denouncing it as an effort to ban books and whitewash American history. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for the Librarian of Congress to be appointed by a congressional commission rather than by presidential appointment. Robert Newlen will serve as the acting librarian until further instruction from the White House.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to pay Hawaii $700 million to settle a lawsuit regarding the efficacy and safety of the blood thinner Plavix. This settlement follows a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi to pay $916 million. The lawsuit centered on the claim that the companies did not adequately update their labels regarding the risk of diminished response to Plavix in about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians. Neither company has admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement.</p>

This trend has caused a decline in film and television production in Los Angeles, prompting concerns about the future of Hollywood.

Legal experts argue that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress, citing historical precedents and constitutional principles.
