          <p>General Motors announced a significant financial beat for its third quarter, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company has consequently raised its full-year guidance for 2025, signaling confidence despite challenges in the electric vehicle market. While EV sales have grown, GM's CFO noted that profitability in the sector is taking longer than anticipated, with the company taking a $1.6 billion charge related to its EV strategy pullback. The improved forecast also reflects a reduced expected impact from tariffs on its operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance and a negotiating team are in Israel to support a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, following a recent exchange of fire. An alleged Hamas attack that killed two Israeli soldiers prompted a significant Israeli bombing response, though Hamas denies responsibility. The peace process has seen incremental steps, such as the return of remains, but long-term stability of the U.S.-brokered plan remains uncertain. Critics, including a former Israeli official, express skepticism about Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace, suggesting he may have incentives to resume military operations.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Covid inquiry that children paid a "huge price" to protect others during the pandemic. While repeating a previous apology for government missteps, he defended the actions of schools and teachers under difficult circumstances. Johnson acknowledged a lack of planning for school closures in early 2020 but stated the primary focus was on avoiding a major public health crisis. He also commented that lockdown rules "probably did go too far" and suggested that in any future pandemic, closing schools should be a measure of last resort.</p>

          <p>Despite bold predictions from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its current capabilities and productivity impact. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks or creating prototypes, some developers report they can create messy, unworkable code that requires more time to fix than traditional methods. Studies on the topic have shown mixed results, with some indicating modest time savings while others suggest tasks can take longer. This skepticism exists alongside pressure from management in some tech companies to adopt AI tools universally, regardless of their suitability for the task.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown could lead to major travel disruptions if it becomes prolonged, according to industry experts. While essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are required to work, they will not be paid during the shutdown. Past shutdowns have shown that extended periods without pay lead to increased employee absences, which can cause long security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have occurred 14 other times since 1980. These events happen when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies, a situation made more common by legal opinions in the early 1980s that prohibited agencies from operating without appropriations. Shutdowns have varied in length and cause, from brief one-day lapses over social events during the Reagan administration to a 34-day partial shutdown in 2018-2019 over border wall funding. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 2018 shutdown resulted in $3 billion in permanent economic losses, highlighting the significant impact these political impasses have on federal workers and the economy.</p>

          <p>Housing experts suggest that a U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to significantly disrupt the mortgage market, though some delays are possible for government-backed loans. Private lenders will continue processing conventional mortgages as usual. However, borrowers seeking loans insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA may face minor processing delays due to potential worker furloughs. A more significant impact could be felt by applicants for USDA loans in rural areas, as the agency is expected to halt the issuance of new loans. Additionally, securing required flood insurance through the FEMA-administered program could become complicated, potentially delaying closings in high-risk areas.</p>

Similarly, the president's salary cannot be reduced while in office. In contrast, non-essential federal workers will be furloughed, and essential employees must work without immediate pay.

          <h2>American Airlines Flight Makes Emergency Landing After Pilots Mistake Static for Cockpit Invasion</h2>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an emergency return shortly after takeoff when pilots misinterpreted a static sound as a cockpit breach attempt. The misunderstanding occurred because an intercom system between the pilots and flight attendants was accidentally left on. The resulting static noise led the pilots to believe someone was trying to force their way into the cockpit, prompting them to turn the plane around as a security precaution. The Omaha Airport Authority confirmed that there was no actual security incident, and the situation was resolved upon landing.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has become Japan's first female prime minister, a historic moment for a nation with a poor record on gender equality in politics. However, her appointment is viewed with caution by some who see her as a staunch conservative unlikely to advance women's rights. Takaichi, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, opposes same-sex marriage and legislation allowing separate surnames for married couples. While her rise is seen by some as a symbolic step that could inspire women and girls, critics argue her policies perpetuate the patriarchal system and that her leadership was a tactical move by the ruling party to appeal to its conservative base.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6th Capitol riot, has been arrested for allegedly making death threats against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Moynihan sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries at an event in New York City. This arrest highlights concerns about recidivism among the more than 1,500 riot defendants who received clemency. Moynihan now faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, adding to a growing number of threats against U.S. legislators.</p>

          <p>In response to a new U.S.-Australia deal aimed at countering its dominance in critical minerals, China has stated that resource-rich nations should play a proactive role in stabilizing global supply chains. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that global production chains are the result of market choices. The U.S.-Australia agreement comes after Beijing imposed stricter export controls on rare earths, a category of minerals essential for numerous high-tech products. The deal is intended to boost supplies of these minerals from sources outside of China, though some analysts note the sector remains difficult for investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has added eight countries, including Japan, Mexico, and Russia, to its travel advisory list concerning the risk of methanol poisoning from counterfeit alcoholic drinks. This update follows several incidents involving British nationals, including fatalities.

Officials are urging travelers to purchase sealed drinks from reputable establishments and be aware of symptoms like blurry vision and confusion, which can lead to severe illness or death.
