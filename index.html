          <h2>Writer Reflects on the Torturous Appeal of Zombie Entertainment</h2>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Rachel Feintzeig explores her obsession with zombie shows like "The Last of Us," despite the anxiety and dread they induce. She argues that these fictional horrors serve as a distraction from real-world anxieties, providing a temporary escape from the kind-of-sort-of-possibly apocalyptic things happening in 2025. The author recounts how horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage, offering a sense of perspective by focusing on someone else's troubles. Ultimately, she acknowledges the relief of the season ending, while also wondering what new terrifying alternate reality she will escape to now that the show is over. The author finds that the only thing worse than suffering through a fantasy apocalypse is having to find a new one.</p>

          <p>A Gaza pediatrician, Dr. Alaa al-Najjar, lost nine of her ten children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis. Her husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was injured as well. Hospital officials and colleagues expressed their grief and condemned the targeting of healthcare workers and their families. The Israel Defense Forces stated that they struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops and that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with some expressing a preference for a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are not allowed, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies show that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire a "digital curfew." Some countries are considering political measures to protect young people from the harmful effects of excessive smartphone use, such as mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media usage.</p>

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters in a simulated game for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers initially considered having him return to the mound early in the season, but decided to prioritize his hitting during spring training, while slowing down his pitching rehab. Ohtani recently threw all his pitches in practice, including a slider, which he had previously avoided due to the burden on his elbow.</p>

While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful that the reopening will bring much-needed customers and revitalize the community. The Army Corps of Engineers has cleared over 60% of lots of debris, but reminders of the devastation remain visible along PCH.</p>

During the trial, Michelle was attacked by the defense, who portrayed her as irresponsible and potentially complicit.

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, which limit patient visitations, even for terminally ill patients. Despite the government downgrading COVID-19's threat level, many hospitals still enforce strict measures such as mask requirements, temperature checks, and limited visitation times. Physicians and social workers argue these restrictions violate human rights and lack scientific evidence. One doctor shared his experience of his wife's mother, hospitalized with cancer, being denied visitation with her grandchild due to these policies, highlighting the excessive nature of Japan's restrictions.</p>

          <p>A new study finds that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass anxiety on to their dogs. The research indicates that when owners dwell on work problems after hours, their pets exhibit more stress-related behaviors. Scientists suggest that dogs are particularly sensitive to their ownersâ€™ moods and can pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study concludes that employed dog owners might benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of their canine companions.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun, capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. The footage released by China South Industries Group has garnered attention from military experts, as this firing capacity outstrips current weaponry. The breakthrough involves eliminating capacitors and powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This advancement overcomes the limitations of earlier prototypes and commercial models, which were hindered by the recharging lag time associated with capacitors.</p>

          <p>New York City's public beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, falling short of the required staffing levels. However, this number is higher than last year's Memorial Day weekend. City officials are hopeful that staffing will increase as students finish classes and summer arrives, with 374 new lifeguards currently in training. The city has implemented incentives like increased wages and signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards, while also improving lifeguard stations. The article highlights the importance of beach safety and the need for vigilance, even with lifeguards present.</p>
