        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has warned that government pledges to reduce crime, including halving knife crime and violence against women and girls, are unlikely to be met without significant additional funding in the upcoming spending review. In an article co-authored with other chief constables, Rowley highlighted a decade of underinvestment, overstretched police forces burdened with debt and outdated technology, and increasing social volatility. He directly appealed to the Chancellor, emphasizing that the policing settlement will determine whether officers can deliver on the government's promises, particularly neighborhood policing. The Home Office maintains it is backing the police with substantial funding, but some forces have already made cuts due to existing budget constraints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has temporarily stopped scheduling new visa interviews for international students as it prepares to expand social media screening for these applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed a cable directing embassies to halt adding further student visa appointment capacity until new guidance on expanded vetting is issued. This move follows other Trump administration policies targeting international students, including efforts to revoke university sponsorship privileges and terminate student statuses, many of which have been challenged in court. The State Department maintains it is using every available resource to vet visa applicants to ensure national security, though an extended pause could disrupt enrollment plans and negatively impact university budgets.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks" and serving sentences for murder and sexual assault, escaped from a medium-security prison in Arkansas by impersonating a corrections officer. Hardin managed to leave the facility after a prison officer opened a secure gate for him. Authorities are conducting an extensive search in the Ozark Mountains, using canines, drones, and helicopters. The escape has heightened concerns among the victim's family, who were witnesses in Hardin's trial. Hardin's escape occurred days after 10 men fled a New Orleans jail, raising questions about prison security measures.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' weather agency reports a 70% chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius benchmark set in the 2015 Paris climate accords. The report indicates that the past decade has been the warmest on record, with expectations of continued negative impacts on economies, daily lives, and ecosystems. Climate scientists increasingly believe the 1.5-degree target is unattainable due to rising CO2 emissions, with predictions of at least one year in the next five exceeding 2 degrees of warming. The report was compiled by the British Met Office based on forecasts from multiple global centers, highlighting the urgency of addressing climate change.</p>

          <p>Vodafone's recent full-year results have prompted comparisons to past promises of a financial "turning point" or "inflexion point," highlighting the company's long history of disappointing investors. The company, once a leader in the FTSE 100, has faced years of retrenchment, asset write-downs, and disposals, including its stake in Verizon Wireless. Despite some expansion in Germany and a merger with Three UK, Vodafone remains heavily dependent on a few key markets. CEO Margherita Della Valle argues that Vodafone is now a simpler business outperforming rivals in key markets, but the company's financial metrics continue to fluctuate, making investors cautious (not investment advice).</p>

CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp framed the election as part of a global battle against "globalists," emphasizing the importance of winning elections to preserve freedom.

United, who may allow Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to leave, need to bolster their attacking options after a poor scoring record last season.

Higher Japanese government bond yields could trigger a wave of capital repatriation, as Japanese investors pull funds from the U.S. The steepening of Japan's yield curve is partly due to Japanese life insurance companies meeting their buying requirements. An unwinding of the carry trade could cause significant sell-offs in U.S. financial assets. This repatriation of funds to Japan is synonymous with the "end of U.S. exceptionalism" (not investment advice).</p>

Skomer Island, managed by the WTSWW, is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. While puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction globally, the thriving population on Skomer Island is considered a conservation success story, but continued protection is needed.</p>

Judge Chutkan dismissed Trump as a defendant but allowed the case to proceed, finding that the states made a credible argument that Musk now "occupies a continuing position" and "exercises significant authority" without proper appointment.

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that Canada was "considering" giving up its statehood in exchange for free protection by the proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system. Trump stated that it would cost Canada $61 billion to remain a separate nation but would be free as the 51st state. Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Mark Carney, have repeatedly rejected the idea of annexation. King Charles III also appeared to reject Trump's proposal during a speech before the Canadian Parliament. Discussions are ongoing between the U.S. and Canada on security programs, including the "Golden Dome."</p>

The 24-year-old became the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, achieving the required benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki. He joins Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university. Onosato is set to forge a rivalry with Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu at the July's Nagoya meet.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law obliging 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries. Under the system, companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and they must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with a surplus. The goal is to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, but the costs may be passed on to consumers in the form of price hikes.</p>
