          <p>In an exclusive interview with ABC News, President Trump conceded that he “could” secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man his administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate Garcia's return, Trump argued that Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though Garcia's lawyers deny this. Trump maintained that Garcia entered the country illegally and stated he would only help if Garcia were the “gentleman” Moran described.

          <p>A letter written by Archibald Gracie IV aboard the Titanic just days before its sinking sold for $399,000 at auction. Gracie, a first-class passenger who survived the shipwreck, penned the letter on April 10, 1912, remarking, "It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her." The letter's prophetic line and Gracie's status as an important passenger contributed to its high value. Gracie later suffered from hypothermia and physical injuries, and he died from complications in December 1912. Optimism Score: 50</p>
