          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire involving two 12-hour periods, signaling an end to escalating air assaults. According to Trump, the war would officially end after 24 hours if the ceasefire holds. However, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Arahchi, initially denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement, stating that Iran would halt strikes if Israel ceased attacks by 4 a.m. Tehran time, but later suggested a final decision would be made later. The announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, escalating the conflict that began on June 12, when Israel launched strikes citing intelligence that Iran was advancing toward obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Officials confirmed that eight people died after a boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park.

The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office later recovered the bodies of the missing people. Witnesses reported blue skies turning to a storm with 40-45 mph winds and snow before clearing up, highlighting the unpredictable weather conditions on the lake, and prompting safety warnings from marine officials.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the federal government will fund Florida's effort to establish immigration detention centers, including a proposed site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facilities will be funded by FEMA's shelter and services program to support areas receiving migrants. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that the federal government approved the state's plan to build facilities that could house up to 5,000 detainees.

          <p>Florida officials have requested the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law criminalizing unlawful entry into Florida.

The report calls for better training for teachers and mental health professionals to identify language issues early and suggests alternative therapies like art therapy.

The law firm KP Law argues that 3M knew about the defect and showed a lack of integrity by supplying the earplugs. The action follows a $6 billion settlement by 3M in the US regarding the same ear plugs, though the company accepted no liability.</p>

          <p>The dollar weakened while the Australian and New Zealand dollars strengthened following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, boosting risk sentiment. The risk-sensitive Aussie and kiwi dollars rose as investors cheered the news. Dovish comments from Federal Reserve policymaker Michelle Bowman, suggesting potential interest rate cuts, further contributed to the dollar's decline. Markets are pricing in a higher chance of a rate cut in July as Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress on the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have sparked bipartisan efforts in Congress to reassert its power to declare war. While some lawmakers are calling for a vote on war powers resolutions, House Speaker Mike Johnson suggests the push is irrelevant due to Trump's ceasefire announcement. Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, claim they were not adequately briefed before the strikes and are demanding more information from the administration. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between the executive and legislative branches regarding military action.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran has threatened retaliation, potentially targeting U.S. military assets in the Middle East, including bases in Qatar, Bahrain, and Iraq. Other options include closing the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil passage, and conducting cyber or terrorist attacks. Experts warn that any direct attacks by Iran would invite a U.S. response, risking the Iranian government's survival. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has also warned of a heightened threat environment domestically, with potential cyber attacks by pro-Iranian groups.</p>

He explained that Iran exports 1.7 million barrels of oil daily through the strait, and closing it would significantly impact its economy. Braziel also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>
