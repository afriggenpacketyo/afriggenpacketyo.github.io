          <p>Following meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, former President Trump announced he has initiated arrangements for a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. In a social media post, Trump stated he called Putin to begin planning the bilateral meeting, which would be followed by a trilateral discussion including himself. This development represents a potential diplomatic step in a conflict that has persisted for nearly four years, though no specific date or location has been set. The Kremlin's official response confirmed the call and expressed support for continuing direct negotiations between the two nations' delegations.</p>

          <p>After nine months of relatively peaceful demonstrations, protests in Serbia have turned violent, with nightly clashes between demonstrators and police involving batons and tear gas. Protesters express fury over what they call the regime's violence, while confusion reigns over the identity of some aggressors, with reports of ruling party paramilitaries involved. The article details instances of severe police brutality, including a student who testified that a police commander threatened to sexually assault her, and mass arrests, creating a volatile situation with an uncertain outcome as President Vucic promises a harsh state response.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction following modest declines on Wall Street, as investors exercise caution ahead of an upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. Traders are also evaluating the diplomatic talks held at the White House concerning the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In Japan, SoftBank Group's shares fell significantly after it announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, snapping a nine-day winning streak. Meanwhile, markets in mainland China and Hong Kong saw slight gains, reflecting the cautious and varied sentiment across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Contrasting Fates of Honeybee Colonies in the U.S. and China Explained by Management Practices</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States experienced its largest-ever collapse of commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has surged to a record high of 15 million colonies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences attribute this stark difference primarily to management practices. The U.S. model relies on large-scale, clustered operations where thousands of hives are transported to specific locations with minimal intervention. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping involves more hands-on, smaller-scale management, which appears to be contributing to the thriving bee populations and maintaining China's status as the world's top producer of apiary goods.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's conduct in Gaza is rooted in structural racism and a persistent colonial mentality. The author highlights the disparity between the EU's swift, severe response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its paralysis regarding the Palestinian situation, despite Israel being a major trading partner. The piece argues that this double standard is shaped by a dehumanizing logic that also affects racialized Europeans and refugees, calling for a moral reckoning within the EU to restore its credibility on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier is confined within the Texas Capitol after refusing to sign a document requiring a mandatory police escort. This condition was imposed on all House Democrats who had left the state to break quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting effort. Collier states she is resisting what she views as an infringement on her rights and an attempt to control lawmakers. The escorts were intended to ensure Democrats' presence for the next special session, where the controversial congressional maps, which could create five new Republican-leaning seats, are expected to be voted on.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and UCLA wide receiver Kaedin Robinson, effectively ending their hopes of playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by limiting their potential to earn NIL compensation. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. This decision deals a significant blow to both teams, who were counting on the experienced transfer players to fill key roles.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has cautioned that the United States may be underestimating the threat posed by China's rapid progress in artificial intelligence. He expressed skepticism that U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors are a reliable long-term solution, suggesting that China can find workarounds like building its own fabrication facilities. Altman also revealed that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models. He emphasized that the AI race is complex and not a simple matter of which country is ahead.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats have ended their two-week walkout and returned to the state, allowing a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps to proceed. Their return coincides with California lawmakers initiating a plan to counter the Texas move by creating a new map that could add up to five Democratic seats in the U.S. House. The Texas Democrats' quorum break was a strategic maneuver to stall the GOP plan and trigger a national response. Now, the focus shifts as both states advance their respective redistricting proposals in a high-stakes political battle ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement and calls for self-deportation are creating a climate of fear that extends to U.S. citizens, particularly those with immigrant parents. Some American-born individuals are now seeking dual citizenship and exploring opportunities to live abroad as a "plan B" for their families' safety and future. The article highlights stories of U.S. citizens concerned about their quality of life and long-term security in the country. This trend is not limited to the Latino community, as a record number of Americans have also recently applied for British and Canadian citizenship, citing political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's recently released AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained global popularity, capturing over 20% of the usage share on the AI marketplace OpenRouter. This places it second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, which is widely considered the industry benchmark for AI-assisted coding. Alibaba claims its model's performance is on par with the leader, attributing its success to extensive training on coding-related data and reinforcement learning. The launch comes as the AI coding sector becomes increasingly competitive, with Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent also releasing their own tools.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department for attaching immigration enforcement conditions to federal grants for crime victims. The new rule denies funding to any program that does not cooperate with federal immigration agents, a move the states argue is an unlawful attempt to conscript local officials into federal enforcement. The lawsuit contends that these conditions force states to choose between forfeiting critical resources for vulnerable victims and compromising the trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities, which is vital for public safety.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity for a significant geographic realignment of teams. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that moving away from the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason formats. While such a change would face resistance from traditionalists, it could foster regional rivalries and improve broadcast schedules. Manfred hopes to have expansion locations selected by 2029, with Nashville and Salt Lake City considered front-runners.</p>

          <p>A new court filing alleges that the May 9 arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was carried out at the direction of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. According to a description of law enforcement body camera footage, a Department of Homeland Security agent announced to fellow officers, "We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general of the United States." The revelation comes from a motion filed by Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was also charged in the incident. This raises further questions about the potential politicization of the Justice Department against perceived opponents of the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A landmark wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure, built in 1912, has been hoisted onto giant transporters for a two-day journey to the new city center. This complex operation is the most symbolic part of a wider city relocation project funded by the local mining company. The church's altar painting and its 1,000-pipe organ will remain inside during the move, carefully stabilized for the trip.</p>
