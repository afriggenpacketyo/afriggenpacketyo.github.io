        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a thrilling first Test match at Headingley, England's captain Ben Stokes played a crucial role in checking India's progress after Harry Brook's impressive 99 runs. Brook, who had been dropped twice and played aggressively, missed out on a century on his home ground after being caught. England managed to get close to India's first innings total thanks to a quick partnership between Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse. Stokes' timely wicket of Sai Sudharsan left India at 90-2, holding a narrow lead of 96 runs as drizzle and fading light brought the day's play to a close, leaving the match beautifully poised.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely closed higher on Sunday, demonstrating resilience following U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. Tel Aviv stocks reached record highs, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would expedite the conflict's resolution. Gulf markets initially rose but Saudi Arabia's Tadawul eventually closed slightly down, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Despite regional tensions, analysts suggest the Gulf's diplomatic stance and calls for peaceful resolutions have shielded it from significant market turmoil, with some believing the removal of the Iranian threat could positively influence international investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The United States has directly entered the conflict between Israel and Iran by launching airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. President Trump declared the attacks a "spectacular military success," claiming the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," though independent verification is pending. The Pentagon confirmed the use of B-2 Spirit bombers and bunker-busting warheads in the operation. While Iran reports no immediate radiation leaks, the IAEA has called for an emergency meeting, warning of potential risks associated with damaging uranium enrichment sites, and the world is watching closely as regional governments express concern and traditional US allies urge a diplomatic solution.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire during a service at Crosspointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, wounding one person before being killed by a security guard. The pastor, Bobby Kelly Jr., reported that the wounded individual was the security guard, who was shot in the leg. Another church member reportedly ran the shooter over with his truck, which provided the security guard an opportunity to fatally shoot the suspect. Approximately 150 people were present at the service when the incident occurred, and local authorities were immediately notified.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present in the Situation Room during the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, despite earlier disagreements with President Trump over Iran's nuclear capabilities.

The White House clarified that Trump and Gabbard are aligned on Iran, emphasizing that Gabbard had acknowledged Iran's resources to potentially build a nuclear weapon, and Gabbard herself accused the media of misrepresenting her testimony, asserting that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it chose to do so.</p>

          <p>President Trump gave the final order to attack Iranian nuclear sites to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday, according to a senior administration official. The decision followed unsuccessful diplomatic efforts led by Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Pentagon simultaneously prepared the operation. Despite ongoing efforts, U.S. officials concluded that Iran was unlikely to negotiate a deal, prompting Trump to authorize the strikes after daily briefings on Israel's actions and the operation's readiness, and the president remained in close contact with Hegseth until making the final decision.</p>

The advisory also notes that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators to target specific groups, and the Department of Homeland Security has shared the bulletin publicly, providing resources for staying safe amid the increased threat environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests avoiding phrases that trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, such as "Because I said so" or "Stop crying." Instead, she recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy and sets clear boundaries, for example, explaining the reasoning behind a decision or acknowledging a child's feelings. By shifting to language that fosters cooperation, parents can create an environment where children feel respected and emotionally safe, which encourages them to listen and regulate themselves more effectively. The goal is to respond with empathy and leadership rather than control and criticism, ultimately strengthening the parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>The U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved B-2 stealth bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs (MOPs), marking the first operational use of the latter. The mission, which officials described as the largest strike using B-2 bombers in history, involved more than 125 aircraft and targeted the Natanz and Fordo sites. Prior to the airstrikes, Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at the Isfahan nuclear site from a U.S. submarine, and President Trump declared that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities had been completely and totally obliterated.</p>

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, fulfilling a benchmark long advocated by US President Donald Trump. Spain initially opposed the measure but later agreed to an exemption, and the formal vote is expected during an upcoming NATO meeting. The new spending target requires all member nations except Spain to reach the 5% goal by 2035, allocating at least 3.5% to core military needs and an additional 1.5% to related expenditures, and this agreement marks a significant shift in defense spending commitments among NATO members.</p>

McKenzie notes Iran's decision-making may be hampered by the loss of senior leaders, and suggests vulnerabilities in Iraq and Syria, but believes CENTCOM has taken measures to harden against potential attacks, and he also acknowledges Iran's long-held desire to attack the U.S. within its borders.</p>
