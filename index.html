          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered numerous cases where dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for conditions like Parkinson's disease, have led to extreme and harmful side effects. Patients have developed compulsive behaviors including gambling addictions, hypersexuality, and coercive or predatory sexual actions, which in some instances have resulted in criminal convictions and destroyed families. Despite long-known risks, the article reveals that doctors are still failing to adequately warn patients about these potentially devastating consequences. The report also raises concerns about drug manufacturers potentially downplaying negative study results regarding the medication.</p>

          <p>A significant labor strike involving employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, is causing garbage to pile up in several American cities. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, arguing that current compensation is unlivable and below industry standards. The dispute, which began in the Boston area, has spread to other states, impacting millions of residents and leading to public health concerns. While the company and union blame each other for the stalled negotiations, affected municipalities are suing for breach of contract and scrambling to manage the growing waste problem.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that a second grenade is missing following a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's training facility that killed three deputies. The deputies had recovered two grenades from a garage, believing them to be inert, but one detonated unexpectedly. An extensive search is now underway for the second device, which officials believe was brought to the training facility but has not been located since the blast. The department has implemented new policies to treat all explosive devices as live to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The United Nations' World Food Programme has issued a stark warning about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating that nearly one in three people are going entire days without eating. Malnutrition is surging, with an estimated 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment, and the death toll from malnutrition-related causes continues to rise. The report comes amid mounting international pressure on Israel to lift restrictions on aid, with Germany, France, and the UK issuing a joint call for immediate action. An ex-contractor for a US-backed aid group also alleged witnessing war crimes, including the use of live fire on civilians at food distribution sites.</p>

The source indicated that Kennedy views the independent group of medical experts as too “woke.” While an HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made, the move aligns with the administration's goal to reshape federal health policy and priorities.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its next-generation nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for a commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. The reactor, named CFR-1000, is a gigawatt-level facility designed for greater fuel efficiency and is now awaiting government approval for construction. This development positions China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, who are also developing advanced reactor technologies. The project aims to become operational after 2030 and represents a key part of China's strategy to enhance its energy independence and technological capabilities.</p>

Demonstrators chanted for the “fall of the regime,” criticizing the government for mass arrests of opposition figures, journalists, and activists, which they say has turned the country into an “open-air prison.” Since his 2021 power grab, Saied has consolidated his authority by dissolving judicial bodies and jailing prominent critics.

While aid agencies have noted that airdrops are an inefficient delivery method, Starmer stated the government would “pull every lever” to get supplies to Palestinians.

          <h2>UK's Warm and Sunny Spring Leads to Boom in Some Insect Populations</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a key food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. However, experts caution that the long-term trend for flying insects is one of decline. The current lack of rain could also negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland areas and affecting egg-laying, highlighting the complex effects of changing weather patterns on ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents unlawfully obstruct federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins stated that the policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor praised the decision, affirming their commitment to policies they argue enhance public safety by allowing local police to focus on community needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the legacy of the Hollywood blacklist, which arose from the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigations into alleged Communist influence in the 1940s and 50s. The exhibit focuses on the “Hollywood Ten,” a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled industry figures to name names, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The display serves as a historical lesson on the fragility of free speech and the dangers of political persecution.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been arrested and charged with wire fraud for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, used platforms like Tinder and Hinge to find victims, whom he deceived by fabricating a successful career as a financial manager and investment expert. He allegedly convinced his matches to invest in fake opportunities, promising regular returns while using their money for personal expenses, including a payment on a Lexus. If convicted on all counts, he faces the possibility of decades in federal prison.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her nine hours of questioning by the Department of Justice, sources told ABC News. This “proffer immunity” allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell’s lawyer confirmed she answered all questions but stated no promises were made in return. The high-level meeting is unusual and comes as the Justice Department faces pressure to provide more transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case and questions swirl about President Trump's connections to the deceased sex offender.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, protected colony away from the source of the disease. Recent observations have confirmed the relocated sheep are surviving and have even produced new lambs, offering hope for the species' recovery in the region.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, announcing the U.S. team's return from Qatar for consultations. Witkoff blamed Hamas, stating its response showed a “lack of desire to reach a ceasefire,” while Hamas officials expressed surprise at the U.S. stance. The breakdown in talks occurs as the United Nations reports a catastrophic humanitarian situation, with children starving to death and a severe lack of food and medical supplies. The war, now in its 21st month, continues to see a rising death toll, with over 59,000 Palestinians killed according to Gaza's health ministry.</p>

Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the maneuver, which data shows was to avoid a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The pilot reportedly told passengers the collision warning system activated and that contact with air traffic control had been lost.

          <p>A recent analysis examines the scientific basis for popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. While a new study suggests 7,000 steps may be sufficient for health benefits, experts offer nuanced views on other goals. A kidney specialist notes the body is well-equipped to regulate hydration through thirst, while a sleep expert emphasizes that consistently getting at least seven hours of quality sleep is vital for long-term health. The consensus suggests that while these numbers are useful guides, a balanced and consistent approach to overall wellness is more important than rigidly adhering to specific targets.</p>

Other key areas include the effects of the menstrual cycle on performance and the higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, in female athletes. This shift away from treating female athletes as “mini-men” is leading to better support, improved performance, and a greater understanding of how to keep women healthy and active in sports.</p>

While the boxes, containing items like pasta, chickpeas, and flour, may provide sufficient calories for survival, they are deficient in key micronutrients such as iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of these items could lead to “hidden hunger” and diseases like anemia and scurvy. The reliance on dried goods also presents a challenge, as recipients need scarce water and fuel for cooking amid Gaza's severe resource shortages.</p>

The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and is a frequent topic of bipartisan concern, though it has grown consistently under both parties.
