          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, employing B-2 bombers with Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Trump described the mission as a "spectacular military success" and warned Iran against retaliation, stating that further attacks would occur if peace is not achieved. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to provide updates from the Pentagon. The strikes followed escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with the U.S. previously considering joining Israel's ongoing attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. The article reflects the start of a new phase in the Middle East conflict, marked by the U.S.'s direct military involvement.</p>

Some Democrats, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, deemed the strikes unconstitutional and grounds for impeachment, while others like John Fetterman supported the president's decision. The debate centers on the president's authority to engage in military action without congressional approval, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the executive and legislative branches regarding war powers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was a deceptive tactic to conceal his decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The decision to strike was made after a meeting with national security advisors, with the aim of dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. government prepared for potential Iranian retaliation by evacuating citizens from Israel and dispersing military assets. The operation was coordinated with Israel, and Trump initiated the assault after being impressed by the success of Israel's offensive.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, questions arise whether it will halt Iran's nuclear program or provoke a wider conflict. The strikes, described by President Trump as a "spectacular military success," targeted key sites like Fordow. The administration has not provided evidence Iran was close to building a bomb, raising concerns about justification. Iran is likely to retaliate through regional attacks, oil route disruptions, or asymmetric attacks abroad, leading to a potential shadow war. The author questions whether the strike was a strategic miscalculation that could unify the Iranian regime and fuel nationalism.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. Trials in Hokkaido detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early treatment and successful surgery. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, making it valuable in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>After their son Blaze Bernstein was murdered by a neo-Nazi due to his sexual orientation and Jewish identity, Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein transformed their grief into a "kindness movement" called "BlazeItForward." They promote positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name. Borrego Park, where Blaze was murdered, features hundreds of hand-painted stones with messages of tolerance, love, and peace. The killer, Samuel Woodward, was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would decide "within the next two weeks" whether to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, ostensibly to allow diplomacy a chance.

The decision marks a shift from Trump's vow to avoid active warfare in the Middle East. Experts suggest Iran could retaliate by setting landmines in the Strait of Hormuz, disrupting global oil supply chains.</p>

One of the targets was Fordo, a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside that is vital to Iran's nuclear ambitions. It is unclear yet what damage the US attack has had on the nuclear facilities, or whether there are any injuries or casualties.
