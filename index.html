          <p>The search for five miners trapped in Chile's El Teniente copper mine has ended with all of them confirmed dead. Their bodies were recovered over the weekend following a tunnel collapse triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor last Thursday. This incident also initially killed one person and injured nine others, bringing the total death toll to six. The state-run mining company, Codelco, has suspended operations at the affected tunnel and pledged to convene international experts to investigate the cause of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A group of over 50 Democratic state legislators have left Texas for Illinois to break a quorum and prevent a vote on a new congressional map. The Republican-proposed map could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts and is backed by former President Trump. This tactic aims to run out the clock on the 30-day special legislative session, though members face potential fines and arrest upon their return. This is not the first time Texas Democrats have used this strategy, having previously fled the state in 2021 and 2003 to block legislation.</p>

          <p>A violent riot at the Taxpan prison in the Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and injuries to eleven others. The unrest, which included fires set within the facility, reportedly began on Saturday due to inmate anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization. This event highlights ongoing issues within Mexico's prison system, including gang control, overcrowding, and corruption. The Tuxpan prison was holding more inmates than its designed capacity at the time of the riot.</p>

          <p>Decades after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, efforts to find the remains of thousands of missing victims persist on the nearby island of Ninoshima. The island became a makeshift hospital and graveyard where many of the dead and dying were brought in the chaotic aftermath of the 1945 attack. Researchers and local residents continue to excavate sites, driven by a desire to provide closure for aging survivors and properly honor the deceased. Recent discoveries include the jawbone of an infant, underscoring the profound and lasting human cost of the bombing.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to improve their survivability. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters. These boosters would allow the drones to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers to evade incoming missiles in the final moments of an attack. According to a research paper, digital simulations of this "terminal evasion" system showed a dramatic increase in drone survival rates to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman has died and another person was seriously injured after being mauled by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. Police responded to a chaotic scene where they encountered several canines, believed to be strays. An officer shot and killed one of the dogs, a pit bull, after it charged at them while they were assisting one of the victims. San Bernardino Animal Control subsequently removed a total of 14 dogs from the park, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed a disturbing international network with thousands of members who film, share, and sell graphic videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. The groups, which originated in China but now have members worldwide, including the UK, operate on encrypted messaging apps. Evidence shows members discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of abuse and promoting competitions to kill animals. Animal rights activists have documented the scale of the cruelty, which they describe as the "depths of evil," prompting police investigations into the network's activities.</p>

          <p>Asian share markets experienced a downturn, following Wall Street's lead, as concerns over the health of the U.S. economy resurfaced.

The potential for lower U.S. borrowing costs and a weaker dollar is now influencing global market dynamics and investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite signaling optimism for a broader trade deal, this point of contention highlights China's resolve to protect its strategic energy and foreign policies.

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich, Germany, declared an emergency shortly after taking off from Washington Dulles International Airport due to a left engine failure. The pilot of the Boeing 787 issued a mayday call while ascending, and air traffic control guided the aircraft back to the airport. The plane landed safely without incident, and there were no disruptions to other airport operations. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned safely with no injuries reported, and the airline arranged for alternative travel to their destination.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash cloud miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake shook the region. Seismologists suggest the events could be linked, theorizing that the seismic waves from the quake may have disturbed the magma system of the already-primed volcano, triggering the eruption. The sparsely populated area has been evacuated, and an aviation alert was issued for aircraft in the vicinity.</p>

          <p>A pest control worker in North Yorkshire, England, discovered a massive rat measuring over 22 inches from nose to tail inside a residence. Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent, comparing its size to a small cat and highlighting it as part of a "growing problem" in the area. The councilors noted that while rodent issues had been addressed two years prior, the rats have returned in greater numbers. The story has gained national attention, which local officials hope will spur effective action to resolve the infestation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's agreement with Nippon Steel regarding its acquisition of U.S. Steel includes unusual provisions that President Trump has termed a "golden share." This mechanism gives the U.S. government significant governance rights, such as requiring presidential approval for factory closures or salary reductions, without holding an actual equity stake. While traditional golden shares involve government ownership, this symbolic version grants outsized control over a private company's operations. The deal, reviewed for national security, reflects a broader trend of government intervention in business transactions involving foreign investment.</p>

          <p>World Athletics has approved new regulations requiring genetic testing for athletes in the female category, reigniting a long-standing and complex debate over fairness and inclusion in sports. The history of sex testing dates back to the 1930s, often rooted in subjective judgments about athletes' appearances. Critics argue that current policies, which often target women with natural variations in their sex biology, are based on limited scientific evidence of a competitive advantage. The new rules also collapse the distinction between policies for intersex athletes and those for transgender women, further complicating the contentious issue.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) following a jobs report with downward revisions. An administration official pointed to the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the dismissal, though without providing specific data to support the president's claim that the numbers were "rigged." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue Trump is attacking the integrity of a non-partisan agency for producing politically inconvenient economic news.</p>

The 22-year-old suspect faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place.
