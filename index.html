          <p>Following the release of a preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad, families of the victims express disappointment and a desire for more definitive answers. The report, which indicated a fuel cut-off to the engines moments after takeoff, is described by one relative as lacking crucial details about the cause. Grieving family members state that while nothing can bring their loved ones back, understanding exactly what happened and whether the disaster was avoidable is essential for them to find some sense of closure. The crash claimed 260 lives, including 241 on the plane and 19 on the ground.</p>

          <p>The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, has stated that the Labour party is failing to defend working people, leading to widespread disillusionment among its members. This criticism follows the union's decision to suspend Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her handling of the Birmingham bin strikes and a vote to potentially sever financial ties with the party. Graham argues that Labour's recent policy decisions have alienated its base, and the union is now questioning the value of its £1.2 million annual affiliation fee. A Labour source defended Rayner, stating she had already left the union in April.</p>

          <p>A recent CFA Institute survey reveals that while students believe finance offers the best career prospects, other data suggests this perception may be misleading. According to the New York Fed, majors like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates than finance or computer science. The article notes a growing demand for humanities majors, driven by the rise of AI, which has increased the need for creative thinking and soft skills. Even major financial firms like BlackRock are reportedly adjusting their hiring strategies to recruit more graduates with degrees in fields like history and English. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This sale follows a significant surge in Nvidia's stock value, which recently made it the first company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the boom in artificial intelligence. Huang's personal net worth has soared to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with investor Warren Buffett. Despite the sale, Huang retains a substantial holding of over 858 million shares in the leading AI chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gatwick Airport marked a significant milestone by welcoming its first-ever all-electric aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro plane. The aircraft, which is on a 17-day tour of France, made a stop at the London airport as part of an "early-stage concept proof" by Gatwick's operator, Vinci. The event highlights the airport's commitment to decarbonization, which includes a £250 million program to achieve net-zero emissions for its own operations. As part of this initiative, Gatwick is also upgrading its entire 300-strong vehicle fleet to be fully electric by 2030, demonstrating a broader push towards sustainability in aviation.</p>

Eateries and shops that survived the blaze report that customer traffic remains significantly below pre-fire levels, with some seeing business down by as much as 25%. The five-month closure of the Pacific Coast Highway isolated these businesses, and the ongoing process of rebuilding in the community has slowed the return to normalcy.

          <p>Despite criticism from some commentators labeling the new "Superman" movie as "superwoke," this analysis argues the film's themes are fundamentally traditional. The controversy stems from director James Gunn acknowledging the character's immigrant origins, a point that has been part of the Superman story for decades. The article contends that the movie is more a story about assimilation and American values, as Clark Kent's heroism is shaped by his upbringing in Kansas, not just his Kryptonian heritage. While the character is an immigrant, his story has rarely delved into the complex political issues of immigration, focusing instead on universal themes of kindness.</p>

So far, the U.S. has only secured a new deal with the United Kingdom, leaving many other major trading partners facing the prospect of steep new tariffs.

The visit occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which Trump has suggested he wants to overhaul. Administration officials emphasized that the federal government is playing a supporting role, empowering state and local leaders to spearhead the recovery efforts for their communities.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of engine power. The crash, which occurred on June 12, killed 260 people, including 241 on the plane and 19 on the ground. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why the fuel was cut, with the second pilot denying he had done so. The investigation is ongoing, with a final report expected in 12 months, as authorities work to understand the sequence of events that led to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has reportedly died from injuries suffered during an immigration raid at a cannabis farm in Southern California. The United Farm Workers union stated the worker died as a result of the enforcement action, during which approximately 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the man was not being pursued by law enforcement when he climbed onto a greenhouse roof and fell. The incident, part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, has triggered protests and a temporary restraining order from a federal judge pausing some aggressive tactics.</p>

          <p>The Welsh rugby team has ended an 18-Test losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in Kobe, securing their first international win in nearly two years. The victory leveled the series at 1-1 and provided a much-needed boost for the team, which had recently dropped to its lowest-ever world ranking. Wales built an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams, and despite a spirited second-half comeback from Japan, a late try from fly-half Dan Edwards sealed the win. The emotional victory marked a positive end to interim head coach Matt Sherratt's tenure before a permanent successor is named.</p>

          <p>As it surges in the polls, France's far-right National Rally party is taking a cautious approach to its relationship with the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks. While sharing similar anti-immigration and nationalist views, the party is wary of the negative perception of Trump among many French voters and the potential economic harm from U.S. tariffs. Analysts suggest the party is trying to moderate its image to attract mainstream voters ahead of the 2027 presidential election, keeping a calculated distance from Washington's more controversial aspects while benefiting from the broader rise of the far-right in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) brought its sport indoors, pouring 300 tons of sand into the Intuit Dome, home of the L.A. Clippers, for a league event. Players expressed excitement about the novel venue, stating that playing in a state-of-the-art NBA arena made them feel like true professional athletes in a way that beachside setups often do not. The move is seen as an effort to grow the sport by making it more accessible to new fans and creating a different kind of viewing experience. The indoor setting, free of wind, also changed the dynamics of the game, leading to faster, more power-driven rallies.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to aid integration, but the idea has drawn sharp criticism. School principals in diverse areas call it impossible to implement, while the national students' body argues it would lead to stigmatization and exclusion. Supporters of the debate, like the German Teachers' Association, agree that language barriers pose a challenge but suggest targeted funding for schools in need is a better solution than redistributing students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, author Raja Shehadeh argues that while Israel's plan to create a camp for Palestinians in Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity, Palestinians should not be surprised by the failure of international law to protect them. He contends that since 1948, international law has lacked effective enforcement, consistently failing to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank. Shehadeh suggests that true hope lies not in legal institutions but in Palestinian resilience, or "sumoud," and the belief that the truth of their suffering will eventually hold Israel and its allies accountable in the court of human conscience.</p>
