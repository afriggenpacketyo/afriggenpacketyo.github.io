          <p>A group of four masked thieves robbed a Seattle jewelry store, Menashe and Sons Jeweler, in a swift daylight operation. Using hammers, a Taser, and bear spray, they smashed display cases and escaped with approximately $2 million in merchandise, including Rolex watches and high-value gems, all within 90 seconds. While no employees were physically injured, the staff are reportedly shaken, and the family-owned store will be closed for an extended period for inventory and repairs. Police are currently searching for the suspects and have asked the public for any information regarding the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced an immediate halt to the issuance of all visitor visas for individuals originating from Gaza. This suspension is a temporary measure while the department conducts a comprehensive review of its processes and procedures.

The State Department's announcement, made via a post on the social media platform X, did not specify a timeline for when the review would be completed or when visa processing for Gazans might resume, creating uncertainty for those seeking entry.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, which concluded without a deal to end the war in Ukraine, political analysts convened to discuss the meeting's significance. The panel explored the potential ramifications for Ukraine and the broader U.S.-Russia relationship. Separately, the discussion also addressed the Trump administration's recent decision to deploy National Guard troops to assume control of Washington, D.C.'s police department. This action was justified by the president as a response to a crime crisis, a claim made despite official data showing that the city's violent crime rates have reached a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>School districts across Florida are removing hundreds of books from libraries and classrooms as a new school year begins, continuing a trend of censorship in the state. This latest wave of bans follows a warning from the state's board of education to the Hillsborough county district, which resulted in over 600 titles being pulled to avoid potential legal action. Critics, including PEN America, describe the actions as "state-driven censorship" aimed at erasing LGBTQ+ voices and honest discussions of sexuality. Fearing similar state retaliation, other districts are proactively removing titles, including classics by authors like Maya Angelou and Kurt Vonnegut, often without a formal review process.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students from the foster care system as they begin their college careers. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, often unaware of the basic necessities like bedding, lamps, or cleaning supplies that dorm rooms lack. The initiative, which started from a small Amazon wishlist, now supports over 140 students, allowing them to select their own items to personalize their new living spaces. By addressing this practical need, the program aims to level the playing field, reduce feelings of otherness, and help foster youth feel more prepared and confident as they transition into higher education.</p>

Salazar uses this extra time for non-work-related activities like reading or walking her dog, allowing for flexibility rather than a rigid routine. She advises that this approach prevents the feeling of failure that can come from not sticking to a strict schedule, setting a more positive and creative tone for the rest of the day.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are preparing to move to a new residence, the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them in a larger home but keeps them near their current Adelaide Cottage and the Lambrook School, which their three children attend. The relocation follows their 2022 move from Kensington Palace, aiming to provide a more private family life. The new home, which recently received approval for minor alterations, is situated in a natural setting that aligns with Princess Catherine's advocacy for the healing power of nature, especially following her recent cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with its flight attendants, leading to a strike by over 10,000 union members. The walkout began early Saturday, disrupting travel for an estimated 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The Canadian Union of Public Employees rejected the airline's proposal for government-directed arbitration, which would have prevented the strike. Key unresolved issues in the eight-month-long negotiations include wages, which the union argues have not kept pace with inflation, and compensation for unpaid work performed while aircraft are on the ground.</p>

While tropical storm watches are active for several Northern Leeward Islands, the hurricane is projected to pass north of Puerto Rico and remain well off the U.S. mainland. However, its strength is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from August 20 to 27. Coastal areas, particularly North Carolina's Outer Banks, could face significant beach erosion and dangerous surf conditions, even as a cold front is expected to keep the storm's core out at sea.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving traditional life milestones such as moving out, securing a job, marrying, and having children. In 1975, nearly half of young adults had met all four milestones, a figure that has dropped to less than a quarter today. Researchers attribute this shift to increased economic barriers, including the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over marriage and parenthood, reshaping the modern definition and timeline of reaching adulthood.</p>

This shift is partly driven by Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which are gaining traction and creating a "halo effect" for the brand. Analysts suggest Apple is feeling the pressure to innovate its own form factors, with rumors of a slimmer iPhone and a potential foldable model in 2026. Samsung's broader range of price points, from budget-friendly to premium, also allows it to target a wider consumer base than Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

After suffering a severe drought last year that reduced crop yields by up to 30%, farmers this year are dealing with excessive rainfall, which delays planting and promotes disease. Compounding these climate challenges are low international demand and depressed prices for crops like soybeans, largely due to retaliatory tariffs from China. This has created a perfect storm for agricultural producers, who feel they are taking a significant financial hit in the short term, regardless of their political affiliations.</p>

          <p>Former police officers who were injured during the January 6 Capitol riot have expressed outrage over President Trump's recent decision to deploy the National Guard to Washington D.C. to address a supposed crime wave. Officers like Aquilino Gonell and Harry Dunn point out the hypocrisy of Trump claiming to support law and order now, when he failed to deploy the guard for hours as they were being attacked by his supporters. They also question the effectiveness of the deployment, noting that crime rates are at a 30-year low and that the move appears to be a political stunt to project authority rather than a genuine public safety measure.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is recruiting older, well-known figures for critical 2026 Senate races, highlighting a tension between the need for fresh leadership and the desire for electability. In Ohio, 72-year-old Sherrod Brown is planning a comeback bid, while in North Carolina, 68-year-old former Governor Roy Cooper has been heavily recruited. While some activists lament this reliance on the party's gerontocracy as an indictment of its failure to build a strong bench of new talent, strategists argue that these proven winners are the best hope for competing in challenging red-leaning states. Their candidacies are seen as essential to making these races competitive and forcing Republicans to defend more seats.</p>

Clark, a veteran NPR correspondent and editor who covered the White House and State Department, is remembered by colleagues for his gentle demeanor, patience, and unwavering defense of reporters. Longtime correspondents praised him as a "masterful editor" and a "rare creature" who combined kindness with a steely determination to get the story right.

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing approaches, survivors, known as "hibakusha," are making a final, urgent plea for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Toshiyuki Mimaki, 83, vice-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization Nihon Hidankyo, continues to share his experiences with younger generations. This appeal comes as East Asia is experiencing a new arms race, with nuclear powers expanding their arsenals and challenging the long-held "nuclear taboo." Japan itself faces a contradictory position, advocating for abolition while relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for security, highlighting the immense challenge the aging survivors face in their lifelong campaign.</p>

This incident follows a separate major breach in 2022 that affected nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants. The government stated there is no evidence the data has been released publicly or poses a threat, but critics have called the repeated security failures "astonishing" and "deeply embarrassing."</p>

          <p>The article explores the growing trend of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services, which disproportionately target women with marketing that frames installment payments as "cute" and responsible. While promoted as interest-free, these services can lead to significant debt through late fees and encourage overspending, particularly in the fast-fashion industry. Financial experts criticize this model and the related "girl math" trend for normalizing debt and trivializing financial literacy among young women. These services act as a gateway to consumer debt, leveraging social media influencer culture to create a sense of attainability for lifestyles that are often unaffordable.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Germany suggests the recent summit in Alaska was a strategic victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who received a high-level reception in the U.S. without offering any tangible concessions on Ukraine. Despite President Trump's claims of a productive meeting, no concrete agreements on a ceasefire or political future for Ukraine were announced. The optics of the meeting allowed Putin to re-enter the global diplomatic stage, while Trump's brief and vague statements left allies uncertain. Following the summit, Trump informed Ukrainian and European leaders of the discussions, with President Zelenskyy now scheduled to visit Washington for further talks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing a major offensive challenge following third baseman Max Muncy's placement on the injured list with a strained oblique muscle. This is Muncy's second stint on the IL this season; during his previous 25-game absence, the team's run production plummeted, ranking last in the majors. His absence disrupts the lineup's balance, removing a key left-handed power hitter who is also effective against left-handed pitching. With the Dodgers tied for first place in the NL West, the pressure now falls on other key hitters like Teoscar Hernández to step up and compensate for the loss of Muncy's consistent threat at the plate.</p>

Experts believe the object, along with a similar piece found nearby in 2021, was a high-status item used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes and may have been deliberately buried.

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by fiber-optic cables, which will extend their range to nearly 100 kilometers. This technology makes the drones immune to Russian electronic warfare and jamming tactics, a critical advantage on the modern battlefield. The extended range is necessary because high-value targets have moved further from the front lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as increased weight and risk of snagging, the ability to conduct precision strikes deep behind enemy lines without fear of electronic interference represents a significant evolution in drone warfare.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic drop in violent crime, with its murder rate on track to hit a 50-year low. This turnaround is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence and offering them intensive support services. This approach, combining social intervention with targeted law enforcement, represents a shift from past zero-tolerance policies. Despite the success, the program's future is threatened by recent federal budget cuts by the Trump administration, which have terminated grants for many of the non-profit partners essential to the city's violence reduction efforts.</p>
