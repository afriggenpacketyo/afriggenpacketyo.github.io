            <p>Authorities arrested Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old Harrisburg resident, after an overnight fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence forced Governor Josh Shapiro and his family to evacuate. Balmer allegedly hopped a fence and intentionally set the fire using a homemade incendiary device, and will be charged with attempted murder, terrorism, and arson. The fire caused significant damage to the residence, but no injuries were reported, and the motive for the attack remains under investigation, though the governor believes it was targeted. State police are offering a $10,000 reward for information related to the case, and a security review of the residence is underway.</p>

            <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, reducing the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band. This decision follows lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter, falling short of Reuters' polled economists' expectations of 4.3%. The Ministry of Trade and Industry also downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some service sectors, as well as the impact of US tariffs and the US-China trade war. The MAS projects similar GDP growth for 2025, reflecting concerns about the economic outlook.</p>

Senator Chuck Schumer had called for the company to pause flights during the NTSB investigation, and the FAA will conduct a review of the tour operator's license and safety record.

            <p>Chinese electronics firms are facing uncertainty following Washington's decision to exempt some electronic devices from its tariffs, while simultaneously considering new "sectoral tariffs" targeting the industry. This move has created confusion and frustration for Chinese suppliers, particularly smaller firms that may not be covered by the exemptions. The US decision reflects China's significant role in the global supply chain for hi-tech products, but the inconsistent policies are hindering long-term planning and investment. Experts suggest the arbitrary nature of these exemptions makes it difficult for businesses to navigate the trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the electronics tariff exemption was temporary, prompting Trump to clarify that no one is "getting off the hook" and hinting at future tariffs. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio warns that the US may face something worse than a recession due to these trade policies, citing a breakdown of the monetary order.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the government's commitment to steelmaking in the UK, while Jingye's refusal of a substantial financial offer led to the intervention.

            <p>Londoners with disabilities and chronic health conditions report difficulties using Transport for London's (TfL) "Please Offer Me A Seat" badge, designed to signal to other passengers that they should give up their seat if needed. Some users have been challenged, questioned, or even threatened when using the badge, despite TfL's efforts to raise awareness and encourage passengers to offer seats. A TfL report showed that in some instances, passengers in priority seats were unaware of the seat's meaning or were not paying attention to their surroundings. TfL encourages passengers to offer seats to those in need, even without a badge.</p>

            <p>A Greenlandic geologist, Minik Rosing, cautions that the prospect of a mineral bonanza in Greenland is a mirage, challenging claims that the territory holds vast untapped resources. While Greenland does possess mineral resources, Rosing argues that they are not uniquely concentrated and that other regions offer easier and cheaper access. He emphasizes the need for facilities to process raw materials and foster a competitive market, rather than simply acquiring more territory. The geologist also points out that the U.S. already has many untapped rare earths and minerals, but lacks the technologies to refine them.</p>
