            <h2>China Warns of Retaliation Against Trade Tactics Similar to Bargaining with a Tiger</h2>

            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning against countries attempting to trade away its interests under pressure from the United States, likening such actions to “bargaining with a tiger for its skin.” The ministry asserts that any agreements made at the expense of Chinese interests will face firm countermeasures. This statement follows reports of the U.S. pressuring trading partners to limit trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions, which China views as unilateral bullying and economic hegemony. China vows to defend its rights and uphold a fair global trading system. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Just hours after a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow concluded, Ukraine reported a surge in Russian drone attacks across multiple regions, triggering air raid alerts in Kyiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia. Explosions were reported in Mykolaiv, but immediate casualty details were unavailable. Both sides had previously accused each other of violating the ceasefire, which Russia has yet to comment on the reported attacks. The renewed hostilities underscore the fragility of temporary truces in the ongoing conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Easter weekend in Australia saw a tragic rise in drowning incidents, with the death toll reaching seven after a nine-year-old boy became trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach. The majority of deaths were attributed to strong swells washing people into the ocean from rocks. Two people remain missing, and the CEO of Surf Life Saving in New South Wales described it as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend. The incidents have cast a pall over what should have been a joyous and religious holiday. </p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a controversial prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported from the U.S. and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of political prisoners held by Nicolas Maduro's regime. Bukele directly addressed Maduro on social media, listing family members of opposition figures, journalists, and activists detained in Venezuela. Venezuela's chief prosecutor criticized Bukele's proposal, accusing El Salvador of unlawfully imprisoning the Venezuelans. This proposal comes amidst heightened scrutiny of El Salvador's human rights record and its acceptance of deported migrants. </p>

Past visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have drawn sharp rebukes from China and South Korea, given the shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals. The Prime Minister's actions are being closely watched amid improving diplomatic ties with China and South Korea. </p>

            <p>JPMorgan expects President Trump's tariff policies to result in trade deals but with increased tax rates, forecasting an effective rate between 10% and 20%. While the firm anticipates slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and inflation, it believes the US will narrowly avoid a recession. JPMorgan recommends structured notes to provide defensive exposure and income, and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to capitalize on market mispricings. These strategies are intended to help investors navigate a more volatile, tariff-heavy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks Mysterio's first Intercontinental Championship reign and his first main-roster singles title, earning him a curtain call before exiting the arena. </p>

            <p>The second season of HBO's "The Last of Us" diverges from the game's storytelling, particularly in its depiction of Joel's death and the events leading up to it. While the show expands on side characters and subplots, some plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, resulting in a less impactful emotional experience compared to the first season. The show explores themes of fractured bonds and the cyclical nature of violence, but its relentless cheerlessness and focus on undiluted pain have made it a punishing watch. Despite glimmers of ingenuity in exploring Ellie and Joel's relationship, the show's limited imagination and circular storytelling have become more glaring. </p>

The jet, which was meant for Xiamen Airlines, landed back in Seattle after making refueling stops. The decision highlights the impact of escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with tariffs making the delivery of new aircraft economically unviable for Chinese airlines.
