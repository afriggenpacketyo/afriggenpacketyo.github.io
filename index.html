          <p>Depression in older adults often goes undiagnosed or is misattributed to the normal aging process, creating a significant mental health challenge. While symptoms are similar across age groups, older individuals may present with more physical complaints, leading to delayed recognition and chronic conditions. Stigma and a lack of awareness among both patients and doctors contribute to the problem, hindering access to treatments like medication and psychotherapy. Experts emphasize that while awareness campaigns are helpful, professional diagnosis is crucial to avoid misinformation and ensure proper care for this vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, over an article detailing an allegedly obscene birthday card sent to Jeffrey Epstein. This legal action represents a significant escalation in Trump's long-standing campaign against media outlets he deems critical. The lawsuit is part of a broader strategy to use the courts and regulatory bodies to punish and discredit news organizations, a tactic he has employed against other major networks. This move also serves to rally his base by dismissing unfavorable coverage and acts as a warning to other media entities.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia Goldring, a 35-year-old woman who spent ten years on dialysis, has successfully received a new kidney from a living donor just days after her story was featured on CBS. Previously, she had been an outspoken advocate, highlighting the challenges of relying on dialysis and criticizing the for-profit clinic system. Her new kidney came from an unidentified living donor, a process that transplant specialists say offers the best outcomes for patients. Goldring plans to continue her advocacy, emphasizing the critical importance of organ donation to save lives, as thousands remain on transplant waiting lists.</p>

          <p>An intense heat dome that has been affecting the central U.S. is now moving eastward, bringing extreme temperatures to the East Coast. Over 100 million people are under heat alerts, with forecasters predicting temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average and feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat is exacerbated by "corn sweat," a process where vast fields of corn release thousands of gallons of water vapor daily, significantly increasing humidity. These dangerous heat and humidity levels are expected to persist through early next week.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Power May Not Depend on Favorable Polling</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite declining poll numbers and cracks in the MAGA coalition over issues like the Epstein files, Donald Trump's hold on power may not be as fragile as it appears. The author contends that tyrants do not rely on public approval, but rather on tactics like voter intimidation, suppressing dissent, and controlling state institutions to maintain power. The piece points to the administration's efforts to access voter rolls, the viciousness of the deportation campaign, and pressure on the press as examples of authoritarian consolidation. It concludes that resistance requires active, nonviolent mobilization to counter these measures.</p>

          <p>Leading Democratic members of Congress are demanding information from the Department of Homeland Security regarding the practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and concealing their identities during operations. In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers argue that this practice erodes public trust, violates constitutional rights, and makes communities less safe by enabling criminals to impersonate law enforcement. Citing several cases of such impersonations leading to crimes, they are pressing for all internal directives and communications that permit agents to use unmarked vehicles and hide their identities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which includes a nearly $9 billion investment in icebreakers, is stirring debate over China's role in the increasingly navigable region. As climate change opens the Northern Sea Route for longer periods, the U.S. aims to reassert its dominance over the "frozen frontier." Chinese scholars argue that these new shipping lanes offer a strategic opportunity for Beijing to counter U.S. geopolitical containment by providing more cost-effective and efficient trade routes. This sets the stage for potential competition and tension between the two powers in the strategic polar region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gated communities in the U.S., particularly popular in states like Florida and California, have evolved to cater to a wide range of lifestyles and budgets beyond just the wealthy or retirees. While security is a feature, the primary draw for many residents is the controlled access to the community and its exclusive amenities, such as golf courses and private water access. These neighborhoods typically operate with Homeowners Associations (HOAs) that enforce rules and collect fees for upkeep. Homes within these communities often command a higher price and tend to have stronger appreciation rates compared to similar non-gated properties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision not to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein has created a significant divide among the president's most ardent online supporters. For years, many in the MAGA movement have demanded transparency on the Epstein case, a call Trump himself endorsed during his campaign. Now, his reversal has led to infighting, with some influencers defending the president's strategic thinking while others express frustration and accuse him of stonewalling. This internal conflict highlights a rare moment of discord where a core conspiracy theory of the base is clashing directly with the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>This analysis describes the humanitarian aid situation in Gaza as a horrific failure, where obtaining food has become a life-threatening risk for civilians. Since Israel imposed a blockade and restricted traditional aid agencies, a new U.S.-backed foundation has operated a few distribution centers that have become deadly. Reports indicate that Israeli soldiers and U.S. contractors have opened fire on desperate crowds, killing hundreds of Palestinians seeking sustenance. With Gaza sliding toward famine and people dying of malnutrition, the current system presents civilians with an impossible choice between starvation and the risk of being shot.</p>

          <p>A recent summit between EU leaders and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing failed to resolve major disputes, exposing deepening tensions between the two powers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted a growing trade imbalance and raised concerns about China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. In response, Xi denied any fundamental conflicts of interest and urged the EU to keep its markets open. While a modest agreement was reached on climate cooperation, the summit underscored a significant divergence on key economic and geopolitical issues, suggesting a period of long-term struggle.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has announced that approximately 6,000 websites featuring pornographic content must begin verifying that their users are over 18. This new rule, part of the Online Safety Act, has gained compliance from major platforms like Pornhub, Reddit, and X (formerly Twitter). While officials and children's charities have praised the move as a crucial step for child safety, some experts remain skeptical about the effectiveness of age-check technologies and the potential for circumvention. Concerns have also been raised about data privacy and the impact on users who may not wish to share their identity.</p>

          <p>A coroner has ruled that the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater in Tenerife was accidental, caused by a fall into a remote ravine. Slater, from Lancashire, went missing in June after a night out, prompting a massive search effort before his body was discovered. The inquest heard that he had taken drugs and alcohol and was attempting a 14-hour walk back to his apartment when he fell. The coroner concluded that he died instantly from skull fractures and brain trauma, noting that a lack of suitable clothing and mountain training were contributing factors.</p>
