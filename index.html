          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, prompting warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While initial alerts were severe, many were later downgraded to advisories as the resulting waves proved to be smaller than feared, causing minor flooding but no major damage in most areas. The event caused significant disruption, with jammed roads in Hawaii and transportation suspensions in Japan. Authorities remain cautious, warning that dangerous currents could persist for hours.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy's 3% growth in the second quarter, driven largely by a tariff-induced drop in imports, has been seized upon by President Trump to intensify his calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

          <p>British housebuilding firm Taylor Wimpey saw its profits erased in the first half of the year, reporting a £92 million pre-tax loss.

The company also noted a slowdown in sales, particularly among first-time buyers who face affordability constraints from high interest rates.

          <p>President Trump has declared that the August 1st deadline for implementing a new round of "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries will not be extended. This announcement solidifies the administration's plan to impose higher import taxes, including a newly announced 25% tariff on India. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, the administration sent letters to numerous world leaders detailing the new tariff rates their countries would face. The move comes despite previous deadline extensions and ongoing negotiations with several key trading partners.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed and 13 wounded in Guatemala City after armed members of the MS-13 gang stormed the funeral of a rival Barrio 18 gang member. The attackers arrived on motorcycles, opened fire on the family and friends attending the wake, and then fled the scene. The Interior Minister blamed the country's pervasive and violent gang rivalry for the attack. This incident highlights the extreme violence plaguing the region, which is a major factor driving migration towards the United States.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump has broken with long-standing tradition by personally meeting with candidates nominated for promotion to four-star general. A spokesperson stated the president wants to ensure military leaders are "war fighters first — not bureaucrats." However, this departure from past practice has raised concerns among some observers about the potential for politicizing the military's highest ranks. The move follows other actions by the president that have blurred the lines between the military and partisan politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from a contraction in the first quarter. However, the Commerce Department report was heavily skewed by large swings in international trade related to President Trump's tariffs. A surge in imports early in the year depressed first-quarter GDP, while a subsequent drop in imports artificially inflated the second-quarter figure. When averaging the two quarters, the economy grew at a more modest 1.25% pace, indicating a slowdown from previous years. (not investment advice)</p>
