          <p>A shooting outside the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada, resulted in three fatalities and multiple injuries. The gunman opened fire in the valet area before being shot and apprehended by police. Authorities are still investigating the motive for the attack, which involved the suspect firing at patrons, a security guard, and a passing driver. The swift response from law enforcement was credited with preventing the shooter from entering the casino and causing further harm.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused deadly floods and landslides in and around Beijing, resulting in at least 34 deaths and the relocation of over 80,000 people. The Miyun district was particularly hard-hit, experiencing record precipitation that prompted authorities to release water from a major reservoir. The storms have destroyed infrastructure, knocked out power, and left residents scrambling to recover from the sudden and destructive deluge. This event highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather, following severe flooding just last year.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the inspiring journey of Indian fast bowler Akash Deep, who recently achieved a five-wicket haul against England. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, he overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon cricket. With the support of a childhood friend, he relocated to Bengal, where his talent was recognized, eventually leading to an IPL contract and a spot on the national team. Deep's story is one of perseverance, family dedication, and fulfilling a dream against immense odds.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build AI "gigafactories" to bolster its technological sovereignty and compete with the U.S. and China. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, these facilities are designed to be one-stop ecosystems for AI development, combining computing power, data, and talent. The goal is to overcome Europe's current lag in AI by providing startups and researchers with crucial infrastructure, though challenges like high energy costs and the need for significant private investment remain.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The move follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and weekend calls with French and German leaders, signaling a coordinated effort to address the crisis after U.S.-led talks failed. The plan aims to provide immediate relief and create a path toward a two-state solution. This comes amid growing domestic pressure on Starmer, with over half of his party's backbench MPs signing a letter urging the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a formal misconduct complaint against federal Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments suggesting the Trump administration might disregard court rulings, thereby undermining judicial integrity. This action follows Judge Boasberg's finding of probable cause that the administration committed contempt of court by ignoring his order to halt deportation flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The complaint seeks an investigation and the case's reassignment to another judge.</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions in federal grant funding. The Department of Education cited concerns that funds were used for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a claim disputed by service providers. With a severe nationwide shortage of school counselors, especially in rural areas, the cuts threaten the jobs of critical mental health staff. Sixteen states are now suing the administration over the decision, which could leave many students without access to essential support.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen, Kenny Laynez, has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by Border Patrol and Florida Highway Patrol drew widespread scrutiny. During the May incident, an officer was recorded telling Laynez, "You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother." The arrest, part of an expanding immigration crackdown in Florida, highlights concerns from advocates about the potential for rights violations as more local law enforcement are deputized for immigration enforcement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest but did not acknowledge that a citizen was detained.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists describing it as an "unbalanced deal" favoring the U.S. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU, a move expected to reduce the EU's GDP. However, the deal also provides certainty by avoiding a threatened 30% tariff and could set a precedent for future agreements. The EU also pledged to significantly increase purchases of U.S. energy.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland highlights the unique and often unpredictable nature of Trump's diplomacy. While the trip provided Starmer with invaluable face time and a chance to solidify their relationship, it also carried risks, with the prime minister navigating Trump's free-wheeling press conferences. Downing Street views such access as crucial for advancing UK interests, particularly regarding Gaza, where Trump's language appeared to align more closely with European positions. The visit underscores the effort to leverage the personal relationship for diplomatic outcomes.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer player, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for attending a junior college and for disruptions caused by the pandemic. The lawsuit claims the denial robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and the chance to enhance his career at USC. The case adds to a growing number of legal challenges against the NCAA's eligibility rules.</p>
