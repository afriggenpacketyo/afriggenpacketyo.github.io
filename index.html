        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has alleged that FBI agents reviewing files on Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to specifically 'flag' any documents that mentioned former President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin raised concerns about the handling of these files, suggesting political pressure influenced a haphazard review process involving around 1,000 personnel. The claim adds to the ongoing controversy surrounding the administration's transparency regarding the Epstein case and evidence collected during the investigation. This development, detailed in Durbin's letter to the FBI Director, underscores the deep political divisions and suspicions surrounding the high-profile matter.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics experienced a sharp decline of over 30% following reports that the Food and Drug Administration is scrutinizing its gene therapy treatment, Elevidys. An inside source revealed the FDA plans to ask the company to voluntarily halt shipments of the drug, while the agency's commissioner publicly stated they are considering whether it should remain on the market. This potential regulatory action comes after the FDA began investigating two patient deaths linked to Elevidys, along with a third death associated with another of the company's experimental therapies. The news has cast significant doubt on the future of the company's key product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Pushing for Minimum 15-20% Tariffs on European Union Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:17:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump is reportedly demanding that a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% be imposed on all goods imported from the European Union, escalating trade tensions. According to sources briefed on the negotiations, this represents a significant increase in demands as the administration's August 1 deadline for a framework deal approaches. The EU had hoped for a more moderate agreement, but talks appear to have stalled over the new demands, which are rooted in Trump's long-standing complaints about the U.S. trade deficit with the bloc. The report of stalled talks prompted a negative reaction in the stock market, reflecting investor concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirees relying on Social Security face significant challenges when dealing with high-interest credit card debt, as their fixed incomes often struggle to keep up with rising costs. This article explores whether individuals on Social Security can qualify for debt relief programs, noting that while they often meet financial hardship criteria, their limited capacity for repayment can be a hurdle. It outlines several potential strategies, such as debt management plans, settlement programs, and credit card hardship programs, which may be more suitable for those on a fixed income. The piece emphasizes that while options exist, they must be carefully chosen to align with the financial realities of retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an ongoing UK employment tribunal, lawyers for a nurse, Sandie Peggie, have criticized NHS Fife for publishing an online statement about her case while it was still being heard. The nurse had complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor, leading to her suspension. The health board's statement alleged the tribunal had incited threats against staff, a move the nurse's counsel called "irresponsible." The tribunal also heard testimony from a senior doctor who described the transgender doctor as being visibly distressed and shaken after the initial confrontation with the nurse. The case highlights ongoing tensions and legal complexities surrounding transgender rights in the workplace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing significant backlash after quietly removing explicit anti-discrimination language from its hospital bylaws that protected patients based on marital status and political views. Seventy House members expressed "profound alarm" over the change, fearing it could allow providers to refuse treatment to veterans. The VA has defended the move as a formality required by a Trump executive order, but critics call the explanation nonsensical, especially given the administration's anti-DEI stance. This controversy is part of a broader pattern of policy shifts at the VA, including shuttering an office that investigated racial disparities in benefits and banning Pride flags.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported 38 cases of botulism poisoning in England over the past six weeks, believed to be linked to the use of unlicensed Botox-like products in cosmetic procedures.

The cases suggest that clinics involved have been using products that are not officially licensed for use in the UK.

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are distinguishing themselves from competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive global networks, and a strategic focus on premium and international travel, which have proven resilient even as domestic demand for economy seats weakens. While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, their emphasis on higher-margin premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs provides a buffer against falling airfares. This strategy allows them to thrive while other airlines struggle to remain profitable, even during peak travel seasons.</p>

          <p>A newly enacted provision from the Trump administration, dubbed "no tax on tips," is creating confusion for workers and tax professionals about its practical application. The policy is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 to 2028, which phases out for higher earners. Crucially, the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify for the break, with guidance not expected until October. This uncertainty is compounded by questions over whether the deduction applies only to tips reported by employers on official tax forms, potentially excluding many cash tips.

          <p>This article pays tribute to Andrea Gibson, the late poet laureate of Colorado, celebrating their unique contribution to contemporary poetry through spoken-word performance and social media. Gibson was known for their intensely confessional and emotional style, addressing topics like queerness, anxiety, and love with a straightforwardness that made their work highly accessible and shareable. While some might view this style as overly sentimental, the article argues that Gibson's focus on connecting with a broad audience was a strength, allowing them to spread a message of empathy and gentleness far beyond traditional poetry circles.

          <p>The UK government has reduced its spending on hotels for asylum seekers by nearly a third, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion in the last fiscal year. According to newly published Home Office accounts, this saving was achieved primarily by moving asylum seekers into cheaper forms of accommodation, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. The average nightly cost per person has consequently dropped significantly. However, experts warn that the recent surge in small boat crossings since March could reverse this trend and lead to a renewed reliance on more expensive hotel accommodations in the near future.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has revealed how invasive Burmese pythons are able to completely digest their prey, including the bones. Researchers identified a previously unknown type of cell in the snakes' intestines that is responsible for processing the massive influx of calcium from a consumed skeleton. These specialized cells manage the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, preventing a potentially harmful overload in the snake's bloodstream while allowing for the full digestion of its meal. This discovery helps explain how the pythons, which are a major threat to native wildlife in Florida, can consume animals larger than their own body mass.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Democratic Party Risks Irrelevance by Embracing Extremism</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the Democratic Party is facing a structural crisis and declining public approval due to its focus on what the author terms "intersectional obsessions and woke grievances." The author points to the party's low poll numbers and the withering of Barack Obama's 2008 coalition as evidence of this decline. The rise of Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist mayoral candidate in New York City, is presented as a case study of the party's shift towards a radical platform that alienates mainstream voters. The author concludes that if the party continues on this path, it is headed for long-term political pain and irrelevance.</p>

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether has surged as the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, the first major piece of legislation to regulate stablecoins, sending it to the President's desk. The bill's passage, along with news that BlackRock filed to add staking to its Ether ETF, has boosted investor sentiment and shifted the crypto spotlight from Bitcoin. Ether saw its strongest two-week gain since 2021, and trading-related stocks like Coinbase also rose. The new law is seen as a landmark moment for the industry, providing a regulatory framework that could increase stability and adoption in the U.S. financial market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that U.S. consumers' short-term and long-term inflation expectations have fallen to their lowest levels since February, before new tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year forecast also declined. This suggests consumers believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary, though the report notes that expectations still remain above late 2024 levels, indicating perceived risk. The data is seen as an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, as well-anchored inflation expectations are a crucial factor in its policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

However, an immigration lawyer present disputed the official account, calling the situation dangerous and traumatic for the community.

          <p>This analysis argues that recent sectarian violence in Syria, particularly in the southern province of Sweida, stems from a fundamental disagreement between the United States and Israel over the country's future. While the U.S. has pushed for a strong, centralized government under new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, Israel remains wary of his jihadist past and has supported local rivals like the Druze minority. This policy clash allegedly led to a misunderstanding where Sharaa's forces moved into Sweida, sparking a bloody conflict that prompted Israeli airstrikes on Damascus. The article suggests this divergence threatens regional stability and the fate of Syria's minority communities.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform makes hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss, restrictive diets, and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to underage users, in violation of its own policies. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, the investigation revealed that interacting with such content led the platform's algorithm to recommend more of it, including videos idealizing eating disorders. Despite TikTok's claims that it removes such content and that the findings are not representative, critics argue it's a systemic problem. The findings highlight the ongoing struggle social media platforms face in protecting young users from harmful material.</p>

Authorities have issued warnings and advised against travel in affected areas where landslides are a risk.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has signed an executive order creating "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees that would make them at-will political appointees. The order aims to streamline appointments for key policy roles and is being framed by the White House as a move to "dismantle the deep state." Critics, however, view it as a further attempt to politicize the nonpartisan civil service, similar to the controversial Schedule F, by stripping job protections and making it easier to hire and fire employees based on political loyalty. Public service advocates warn this could destabilize government operations and harm effective service delivery for the American people.</p>

While intended to project transparency and counter Democratic criticism, it risks fueling the very conspiracy theories that have been rampant within his MAGA base. The article suggests that a partial or unsatisfying release will only reinforce beliefs of a cover-up, while also drawing more media scrutiny to Trump's own past association with Epstein. This situation threatens to undermine Trump's anti-elite mystique by exposing him as a participant in the world he claims to oppose.</p>

The review praises the film's visual style, which integrates social media feeds and online content to create a sense of overwhelming digital noise.

Her team uncovered documents she argues are proofs of life, including evidence that a pretender to the throne, Lambert Simnel, was in fact the elder prince, Edward V. While her thesis challenges centuries of accepted history, it has been met with skepticism from some historians who find the traditional account more plausible.</p>
