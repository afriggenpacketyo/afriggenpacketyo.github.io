        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has increased trade-in prices for iPhones in China to boost demand in a crucial market where it faces stiff competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. The iPhone 15 Pro Max trade-in value has risen to 5,700 Chinese yuan ($791), up from 5,625 yuan. This move comes as Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year in the first quarter, with its market share declining from 15% to 13%. Apple is also navigating supply chain concerns and potential tariffs, exploring production shifts to India, though the US government prefers domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced a 7% fall in energy prices starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This reduction will result in an annual bill decrease of Â£129 for a typical household, reflecting a drop in international wholesale gas prices. While charities welcome the relief, many customers still struggle with energy debt, collectively owing about Â£4 billion to suppliers. The price cap will be adjusted every three months, with analysts anticipating minimal changes by October, and the regulator is also considering changes to the system of standing charges.</p>

          <p>Tensions escalated in the disputed South China Sea after a confrontation near Sandy Cay between Chinese and Philippine vessels. The Chinese coastguard said it used water cannon against Philippine vessels that it claimed illegally entered waters near Subi Reef and Sandy Cay in the Spratly Islands. China alleges the Philippine vessels landed personnel on Sandy Cay and approached a Chinese ship dangerously, resulting in a collision. The Philippines has been urged to cease its actions, with China asserting it will continue law enforcement activities in the disputed waters.</p>

          <p>Incessant rain has caused massive floods in eastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales, where more than six months' worth of rain fell in three days. The floods have inundated streets, cut off towns, and destroyed homes, leading to a natural disaster declaration and deployment of the Australian Defense Force. The death toll has risen to four, and tens of thousands of people remain isolated, even as waters started receding. Authorities are warning of contaminants and dangers in floodwaters as residents return to their homes, and experts suggest climate change contributes to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.</p>

While his aides claim this was in line with US regulations for men over 70, others argue that presidents receive more rigorous medical care. Experts note that while routine screening may not be recommended after 75, prostate health questions are still relevant. New, more accurate tests are available, and less invasive treatments exist, raising concerns about the decision to forgo screening.</p>

Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple since 1792, with around 114 billion currently in circulation.

          <p>A private jet crashed into a San Diego neighborhood in foggy weather, killing a music talent agent, Dave Shapiro, and five others. The jet hit a power line and slammed into a home, igniting multiple vehicles and causing extensive damage. No one in the neighborhood died, but several residents were hospitalized for smoke inhalation and injuries. The plane originated from Teterboro, New Jersey, and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego, with investigators working to determine the cause of the crash.</p>

Seven of the eight rowers on the men's heavyweight crew team and a large portion of the men's hockey and squash teams are international students. The Department of Homeland Security cited an unsafe campus environment due to 'anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators' assaulting Jewish students as the reason for the revocation.
