          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK as the leader of its "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf initially cited that working to get the party elected was not a good use of his time, but later expressed regret, attributing his decision to exhaustion after 11 months of volunteer work. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media. Yusuf had previously criticized Sarah Pochin's call to ban the burka, emphasizing the need for party alignment. </p>

          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally authored text messages detailing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen or if other staffers were responsible. The investigation aims to determine how classified strike details ended up in a commercial messaging app, Signal. The details were shared in chat groups, including one with Vice President JD Vance and another with Hegseth's wife. Investigators are also inquiring whether staff members were instructed to delete messages, as the government is legally required to retain federal communications. </p>

He suggests preparing oatmeal with water and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added health benefits, while avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processing and added sugars. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. Eating oatmeal can also reduce hunger and promote healthy gut bacteria. </p>
