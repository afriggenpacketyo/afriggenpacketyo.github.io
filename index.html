          <p>Law enforcement in New Orleans has successfully apprehended Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks prior. The capture occurred peacefully at a local residence, leaving only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, still at large. The jailbreak, which involved exploiting a faulty cell door, has drawn significant criticism towards the management of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's office. Authorities have also arrested at least 16 individuals accused of assisting the inmates during their escape, and a $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final capture.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court ruling that limited the scope of nationwide injunctions, the ACLU and other legal groups filed a new class-action lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The lawsuit argues the order is unconstitutional for denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or permanent residents. While the Supreme Court's decision allows the executive order to take effect in some regions, it did not rule on its underlying legality. This new legal challenge seeks to protect all children who would be affected by the policy.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring sister duo Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show, known for its dark humor, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial struggles and chaotic relationships. The creators discuss how their all-female upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene influence the show's content, which tackles taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. The success of the first series has emboldened them to explore even more depressing, yet humorous, storylines in the follow-up.</p>

          <p>A century-old former Russian Consulate in Hakodate, Hokkaido, is being repurposed as a luxury hotel named Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate. The historic redbrick building, constructed in 1908 and vacant for nearly 30 years, is the only surviving imperial Russian consulate in Japan. After being acquired by a Nagoya-based company in 2021, the building underwent extensive restoration to blend its original Western architecture with modern Japanese design. The hotel aims to preserve a piece of local history while creating a new tourist attraction featuring six high-end suites, private saunas, and fine dining.</p>

          <p>In response to a Supreme Court decision limiting nationwide injunctions, immigrant rights groups have altered their legal strategy by filing a national class-action lawsuit against President Trump's birthright citizenship order. The new lawsuit aims to provide complete legal relief for all individuals potentially affected by the executive order, a tactic suggested in Justice Sotomayor's dissent. The original Supreme Court ruling did not address the constitutionality of the order itself but cleared a path for it to be implemented in some areas. This legal maneuver represents the next phase in the ongoing battle over the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>

Research from Chubu University suggests it can enhance immune function, and its resilience makes it a promising food source in the face of climate change.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, particularly anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly lied by claiming Newsom was untruthful about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The complaint accuses Fox News of distorting facts to support the President and acting with ill will toward the governor due to his progressive political stance. Newsom's legal team has offered to dismiss the lawsuit in exchange for an on-air retraction and apology, drawing a parallel to the network's recent settlement with Dominion Voting Systems.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent highlights the renewed scientific interest in bacteriophages, or "phages," which are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria. This century-old concept, known as phage therapy, is being re-examined as a promising alternative to antibiotics amid the growing crisis of drug-resistant superbugs. The article details a project where individuals can submit samples from their environment to find new phages, with one found in a toilet proving effective against a patient's persistent infection in a lab setting. While challenges remain in bringing phage therapy to mainstream medicine, it represents a hopeful frontier in the fight against untreatable infections.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its plan to tighten eligibility for disability benefits, following the threat of a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. The proposed cuts were intended to generate significant savings to meet the Chancellor's borrowing rules but were criticized as a short-sighted cost-cutting measure rather than a long-term reform plan. The reversal raises questions about the government's strategy for addressing the rising number of people out of work due to ill health. The compromise will spare current benefit claimants and soften the changes for future ones, but it leaves a multi-billion-pound hole in the budget. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate failed to advance a resolution that would have required President Trump to seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran. The measure, which invoked the 1973 War Powers Resolution, was defeated in a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed. The vote occurred in the context of recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and a fragile ceasefire. Proponents argued for the constitutional role of Congress in declaring war, while opponents believed the resolution was unnecessary at this time, highlighting the ongoing debate over executive versus legislative war-making powers.</p>

The band played fan favorites like "Chocolate" and "Love It If We Made It," demonstrating their tight musicianship. While some critics noted the performance felt safer than past shows, it was an impeccable tour of the band's catalog that solidified their status as major festival headliners, closing out a day that also featured surprise sets from Lorde and Lewis Capaldi.</p>

In response, Mamdani encouraged the president to learn about his actual policies, which are aimed at making the city more affordable for its residents.</p>

The defense attorney contended that the case is not about crime but about money, portraying Combs as the victim of an overzealous prosecution and accusers seeking financial gain. Prosecutors countered by stating the trial was about how Combs used his power, wealth, and fear to create a criminal enterprise where "'no' was never an option."

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to limit the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, handing a partial victory to the Trump administration in a case concerning its birthright citizenship policy. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, states that lower courts can only issue injunctions broad enough to provide relief to the specific plaintiffs in a case. While the ruling does not decide the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order, it allows the policy to proceed in areas not covered by the now-narrowed injunctions. The decision represents a significant shift in judicial power, curtailing a key tool used to check executive actions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to curtail nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship case represents a dramatic expansion of presidential authority. The author contends that by limiting the power of lower courts to block unconstitutional executive actions, the court has effectively allowed the president to nullify rights at will, pending lengthy legal challenges. The ruling creates a "jurisprudence of citizenship" where rights depend on one's location. The piece concludes that the decision is a bad-faith, politically motivated move that poses an "existential threat to the rule of law" by enabling unchecked executive power.</p>
