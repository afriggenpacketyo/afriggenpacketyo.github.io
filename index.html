          <p>A vehicle rammed into a crowd at a Filipino street festival in Vancouver, resulting in the deaths of several people and numerous injuries. Police are investigating the incident as a mass casualty event, but have ruled out terrorism as a motive.

          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major commercial port in Iran, has resulted in at least 28 fatalities and 800 injuries. The blast caused widespread damage, destroying buildings and vehicles within a 50km radius. Initial reports suggest the explosion was caused by a fire that spread to unsealed containers storing flammable materials. Some reports suggest that the containers held solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles, though Iran's Defense Ministry has denied this. The incident has led to the closure of schools and offices in the surrounding area and triggered investigations into the cause of the explosion and safety protocols at the port.</p>

          <p>As Vietnam prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the government is subtly shifting the narrative surrounding the event. While officially known as "The Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day," the term "Reunification Day" is gaining traction, potentially bridging divides between Vietnamese within Vietnam and the diaspora. This shift is seen as an effort to foster national reconciliation and improve cooperation with the U.S., even as the country navigates complex geopolitical relationships with both China and the U.S. The anniversary celebrations will include parades, fireworks, and airshows, reflecting a mix of enthusiasm and ambivalence among the Vietnamese people.</p>

          <p>The San Jacinto Tunnel, a 13-mile-long tunnel bored through Mt. San Jacinto in the 1930s, is a crucial component of the Colorado River Aqueduct, delivering up to 1 billion gallons of water daily to Southern California. During annual maintenance, the Metropolitan Water District offered a rare glimpse inside the tunnel, showcasing its impressive engineering. Groundwater constantly seeps into the tunnel, creating unique challenges for maintenance crews. The tunnel's construction was a monumental effort during the Great Depression, providing water that fueled Southern California's growth, but also impacting nearby Native American communities.</p>

These companies produce models with fewer imported components, making them less vulnerable to tariffs. The tariffs could increase the cost of batteries and other EV components, potentially ceding ground to Chinese automakers. Ultimately, the tariffs are expected to raise prices for all vehicles and may lead to parts shortages, but vehicles with lower tariff exposure could gain a competitive edge.</p>
