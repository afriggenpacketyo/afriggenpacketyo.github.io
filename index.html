          <p>Tesla's stock is showing signs of recovery in pre-market trading after a significant drop triggered by a public disagreement between Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock experienced an 18% plunge during trading hours but is now up by 4.5% before the market opens. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes the feud was unsettling for investors, emphasizing the mutual need for cooperation between Musk and Trump. Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly its autonomous technology, suggesting the stock's overselling is an opportunity. Optimism remains high that Tesla's stock will continue to be bullish moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations despite concerns about tariffs and a potential economic slowdown.

The healthcare and leisure and hospitality sectors contributed significantly to the job growth, while the government sector experienced job losses due to federal workforce reductions.

          <p>President Trump has dismissed his public dispute with Elon Musk, stating he is "not particularly" interested in speaking with him following Musk's criticism of Trump's policies. Despite reports of being "bummed" about the fallout, Trump focused on positive economic indicators like decreasing inflation and increasing foreign investment, while mentioning his upcoming visit to China. The exchange was sparked by Musk's disapproval of Trump's tax and immigration bill, leading to accusations and threats from both sides. Musk briefly softened his stance after a user suggested cooling off, retracting his threat to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The White House has called the feud "an unfortunate episode".</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident, who participated in anti-Israel protests. ICE attempted to arrest Chung in March, but the court has now barred them from doing so without prior approval. The ruling ensures Chung remains free while her legal case proceeds and requires the government to provide 72 hours' notice before any detention attempt not related to deportation. Chung's attorneys argue the government's actions are an assault on her First Amendment rights, while the Trump administration claims her protest activity poses a foreign policy risk.</p>

          <p>The UK has repositioned its stance in the Western Sahara conflict, with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy stating that the Moroccan autonomy plan represents the "most credible" position. This shift aligns the UK with other Western countries but is likely to anger Morocco's regional rival Algeria, which backs the Polisario Front seeking an independent West Saharan state. Experts note that while the UK is showing flexibility, France has taken a stronger stance in supporting Morocco's claim. The UN continues to propose a referendum for the region's inhabitants to decide on whether they want to be part of Morocco or independent.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a strategic railway project connecting the Kashmir Valley to the Indian mainland by train for the first time. The 272-kilometer line is intended to improve connectivity and boost spiritual tourism and livelihood opportunities. This marks Modi's first visit to the contested region since recent military clashes between India and Pakistan. The project includes the Chenab Rail Bridge, touted as the world’s highest railway arch bridge, and is part of a broader push for infrastructure development in the region.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Trump was overshadowed by the Trump-Musk feud, but it was still considered a success for Merz. Despite being sidelined, the distraction may have helped Merz avoid more controversial topics. Merz addressed strengthening U.S.-German relations, tariffs, support for Ukraine, and NATO defense spending with Trump. He also gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, emphasizing the family's connection to Germany.</p>

          <p>This article examines the financial impact of the Glazer family's ownership of Manchester United over the past 20 years. Since acquiring the club in 2005, the Glazers have loaded significant debt onto the club, leading to substantial interest repayments and dividend payouts to shareholders. BBC Verify's analysis shows that approximately £1.2 billion has left the club due to debt-related expenses and payments to Glazer family companies. These costs, it is argued, would likely not have occurred without the Glazer takeover, and the club has declined to comment on the findings.</p>

          <p>A London High Court judge has warned lawyers that using artificial intelligence to cite non-existent cases could lead to contempt of court charges or even criminal prosecution. This warning comes after lawyers in two cases used AI tools to prepare written arguments, which included fake case law. The judge emphasized the serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence if AI is misused. Legal regulators and industry leaders are being urged to ensure lawyers understand their ethical obligations when using AI in legal practice.</p>

          <p>Newly unearthed documents reveal that the D-Day landings received a boost from the import of penicillin from America. Despite its discovery in London, large-scale production of the antibiotic had struggled to take hold in Britain. Prime Minister Winston Churchill became increasingly frustrated that Britain had not been able to produce enough penicillin in the preparations for the Normandy landings in 1944, eventually being forced to import it from America. The documents highlight efforts to boost quantities of the antibiotic, with plans made for casualties from the frontline in France to be brought back to coastal hospitals in Britain for treatment.</p>

The court revoked the 2022 decision that had ordered the former executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation.

          <p>The article argues that President Trump's proposed cuts to funding for NPR and PBS would disproportionately harm rural America, where public media serves as a vital source of information. In areas with limited access to local news, NPR and PBS provide essential news, cultural programming, and emergency alerting services. The author contends that these cuts would exacerbate the growing problem of "news deserts" and undermine democracy by reducing access to credible information. The article urges Congress to reject the proposed cuts and emphasizes the importance of public media for communities across the country.</p>

Initially motivated by concerns about losing family land and wanting to instill a sense of cultural identity in her children, she joined a hālau, or hula school, in suburban Washington, D.C. Through learning the dances, chants, and history, she found a deeper understanding of her kuleana, or sacred duty, to honor her ancestors and pass on their stories.

          <p>The article explores the corrosive effects of resentment on relationships and provides strategies for addressing it. Resentment stems from broken expectations or feeling inferior, and it often leads to bitterness and contempt. The author recommends communicating needs directly and using "I statements" to express feelings without blaming others. Workplace resentments are more complex due to power imbalances, but it is crucial to address them constructively or seek therapeutic support. It is important to assess the situation and determine if it is worth addressing the issue or letting it go.</p>
