          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. The Swiss luxury group's revenue rose 7% year-on-year, exceeding analysts' forecasts. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines, overall sales rose annually across all regions except Asia Pacific (ex. Japan). Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research pointed to gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations as key headwinds.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating fires in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, many residents have been displaced, creating a diaspora that has significantly impacted these close-knit communities. Over half of those displaced moved at least a half-hour's drive away, while a quarter left the Los Angeles metro area entirely, settling in areas with higher population density. The article highlights the challenges faced by these fire victims, including school transfers, longer commutes, and the loss of established relationships.

          <p>Canada's iconic Hudson Bay brand will survive after its intellectual property is sold to competitor Canadian Tire. The move comes after the Hudson Bay Company liquidated all its stores due to a shifting retail landscape and U.S. tariffs. The sale ensures the brand, which is over 350 years old and known for its striped wool blankets, will continue to exist even without physical stores. Demand for Hudson's Bay products surged as the company closed down, sparking hope for a comeback.</p>

          <p>An additional 276,000 people have filed for Social Security benefits this fiscal year, a 13% increase from a year ago, driven by anxiety over the economy and changes at the Social Security Administration. The Trump administration's efforts to diminish the federal bureaucracy, coupled with economic uncertainty, prompted some retirees to claim benefits earlier than planned, even at the cost of reduced lifetime payments. Agency officials acknowledged that fear-mongering influenced beneficiaries' decisions, with some officials describing the increase in claims as 'dramatic'.</p>

          <p>President Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of "calling for the assassination of the president" with a since-deleted social media post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump and his supporters interpreted the numbers as a threat, while Comey denied any violent intent and said he was unaware of the association. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service have opened an investigation into the matter. Comey stated that he simply saw a cool shell formation on his beach walk and that he opposed violence of any kind.</p>

He expects auditing fees to drop significantly now that Galaxy is listed on the Nasdaq. The ordeal, Novogratz said, has strengthened the company, which was primarily funded through investment gains and trading.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, pointed investigators toward the killer of Jeanie Childs. Investigators compared the footprints to multiple people, including Arthur Gray, who was later cleared. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile, which was submitted to genealogy websites. This led to Jerry Westrom, who was eventually arrested for the murder of Childs. The article previews a 48 Hours episode detailing the investigation and the forensic evidence that led to Westrom's arrest.</p>
