          <p>The U.S. has urged Denmark to "calm down" after the Danish government summoned a top American diplomat over an alleged covert influence operation in Greenland. Reports from Denmark's public broadcaster suggest Americans linked to former President Trump were attempting to infiltrate Greenlandic society to promote secession from Denmark and potential annexation by the U.S. This diplomatic friction highlights Greenland's strategic importance and the strain on relations between the two NATO allies, with Danish officials calling any interference unacceptable. The incident is compounded by other recent U.S. actions, including President Trump's stated desire to acquire the territory.</p>

          <p>Miami Dolphins General Manager Chris Grier disclosed that he received hateful emails from fans following the team's disappointing 8-9 season, including one wishing his children would die of cancer. While speaking to the media about the team's roster, Grier acknowledged fan frustration but condemned the personal and threatening nature of the messages, stating they reflect more on the senders' personal issues. He maintained that in-person interactions with fans have remained respectful, contrasting sharply with the vitriol expressed anonymously online. Grier also provided updates on player injuries ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Nevada officials have confirmed that a "sophisticated ransomware-based cybersecurity attack" has crippled state government networks and may have resulted in the exfiltration of personal data. The attack, which occurred on Sunday, disrupted essential services statewide, forcing the closure of DMV offices and temporarily downing state police dispatch lines. While officials initially believed no data was stolen, an ongoing investigation has found evidence that malicious actors moved some information outside the state network. Cybersecurity experts note that state and local governments are increasingly becoming prime targets for such attacks, highlighting a widespread vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis has left two children, aged eight and ten, dead and 17 other people injured, including 14 children. The attack occurred during a morning worship service on the first week of school, with the 23-year-old suspect, who is also deceased, reportedly dressed in black and carrying multiple weapons. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though the suspect's specific motive remains unknown. Officials reported that some of the injured children are in critical condition, while Mayor Jacob Frey urged for action beyond "thoughts and prayers."</p>

          <p>A heated verbal exchange occurred between tennis players Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko at the net following their second-round match at the US Open. After Townsend secured a 7-5, 6-1 victory, the post-match handshake devolved into an argument, with Ostapenko later accusing Townsend of being disrespectful during the match.

          <p>A significant leadership crisis is unfolding at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as Director Susan Monarez is reportedly refusing to resign despite being ousted by the Department of Health and Human Services. Her lawyers stated she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives" from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The turmoil intensified as three of the CDC's most senior career officials—the Chief Medical Officer and the heads of the infectious disease and immunization centers—resigned in protest. Their departure letters cited the "ongoing weaponizing of public health" and political interference in scientific matters.</p>

Brown, known for producing films like "The Fallout," is accused of running a "Ponzi-like scheme," siphoning funds intended for film projects to finance a lavish lifestyle that included luxury cars, home remodeling, and even surrogacy costs. The indictment claims he used various tactics, such as creating a fraudulent film financing company and overbilling for services through a company he controlled.

          <p>An audio diary has chronicled the harrowing journey of a seven-months-pregnant woman, Amira, as she fled through an active war zone in Sudan. Her escape from the city of En Nahud, recently seized by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), was necessitated by the collapse of healthcare services. She described a treacherous trip on an overloaded truck controlled by armed, intoxicated RSF fighters, facing constant threats of violence and extortion at numerous checkpoints. Her journey highlights the brutal reality for civilians caught in Sudan's civil war, where travel is perilous and people are targeted based on their ethnicity.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's decision to revert to its old logo less than ten days after introducing a new one has sparked a culture war debate, though the controversy misses the mark. The backlash claimed the redesign was "woke," but the article argues the chain has always been a corporate imitation of rural life, capitalizing on nostalgia for a disappearing Americana since its founding in 1969. The new, modern-farmhouse aesthetic was not a political statement but another step in sanding off rough edges for mass appeal, similar to its original mission. The incident reveals that Cracker Barrel is not a victim of a corporate monoculture, but rather an integral part of it.</p>

          <p>The Pickett Fire in Northern California is threatening Napa Valley vineyards, raising concerns about smoke taint that can ruin grape crops even if the flames do not reach them. Winery owner Chris Jambois of Black Sears Winery recounted losing two entire vintages in recent years due to smoke from previous fires, which rendered the resulting wine undrinkable, tasting "like licking an ashtray." The current blaze, the largest in the Bay Area this year, follows a similar path to the destructive 2020 Glass Fire. The recurring threat from wildfires and smoke is forcing vintners to consider the long-term viability of their businesses.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small packages shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption has more than doubled in the last year, reaching £3 billion. This surge is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. Current UK rules exempt imports valued at £135 or less from customs duties, a loophole that UK retailers argue allows overseas companies to unfairly undercut them. The UK government is now reviewing these regulations, facing pressure from industry groups to act swiftly to protect domestic businesses and ensure consumer safety from potentially unregulated goods.

The first woman to come forward stated she was drugged and sexually assaulted at his villa, and expressed guilt for not reporting it sooner, wondering if it could have prevented the subsequent attack. The proximity and similarity of the two assaults were so striking that Metropolitan Police initially questioned if it was the same victim, highlighting Zou's confidence.

          <p>A UK charity named Greater Change is pioneering an approach to tackling homelessness by providing direct cash grants to people at risk of losing their homes. The organization reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, with the funds typically used for rent deposits, bills, or clearing debts. This model, which gives individuals the "dignity of choice," is based on international evidence suggesting that people make responsible decisions when given direct financial aid. While the initiative is small-scale, the charity argues it saves taxpayer money in the long run by preventing the higher costs associated with full-blown homelessness.</p>

          <p>Author Jacqueline Wilson has released "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." She describes the new novel, which revisits sisters Dolphin and Star and their mother Marigold who has bipolar disorder, as both the easiest and hardest book she has ever written. The sequel explores the long-term impact of growing up with a mentally ill parent, with 33-year-old Dolphin still serving as her mother's primary caregiver. Wilson reflects on her commitment to writing truthfully about difficult subjects, even when it pushes boundaries, and her desire to explore the complex, often unresolved realities of family life.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly become the dominant force in the global electric vehicle market, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023 and overtaking Tesla in EV revenue. This transformation, driven by massive government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain, has been led by companies like BYD. The influx of affordable, technologically advanced Chinese EVs is putting pressure on traditional automakers in Europe and the U.S., leading to new tariffs and regulatory scrutiny. Analysts predict China's influence will continue to grow, with the country expected to produce four out of every ten cars built globally by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer acknowledged that Nvidia's stock dipped after the report but attributed it to sky-high expectations rather than fundamental weakness.

The proposal is a response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw the state's congressional districts, which Republicans claim would silence rural voters. While the plan to divide California is highly unlikely to succeed, it serves as a powerful messaging tool for Republicans rallying opposition to the redistricting measure.

The article places this result in the context of other memorable giant-killings, such as non-league Sutton United's victory over Coventry in 1989 and Bradford City's comeback win against Chelsea in 2015.
