          <p>A severe geomagnetic storm may cause the Northern Lights to be visible as far south as Alabama on Sunday night into Monday morning. This rare occurrence offers a chance for many across a large portion of the country to witness the colorful streaks of light typically seen only in more northern latitudes. The phenomenon is due to increased solar activity interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating a spectacular display in the night sky. Observers are encouraged to find dark locations away from city lights for the best viewing experience. </p>

          <p>David Challen successfully campaigned to free his mother, Sally Challen, from prison in 2019 after she killed his father, Richard, who had subjected her to decades of coercive control. David has written a book called 'The Unthinkable' about his family's experiences, highlighting the insidious nature of non-physical domestic abuse. A 2015 law recognizing psychological manipulation as a form of domestic abuse helped secure Sally's release, providing a language to describe the abuse the family had normalized. David now works as a domestic abuse campaigner, advocating for greater protection for victims and sharing his story of intergenerational trauma to help others.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker is facing criticism from conservatives for allegedly giving a "Nazi salute" to California Democrats, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk's similar gesture in January. Booker addressed the California Democratic Party's convention, urging supporters to "stand up" to President Donald Trump. He concluded his speech with a gesture involving placing his hand on his chest before raising it to the crowd, which some conservatives are interpreting as a Nazi salute. Media outlets are being questioned about whether they will treat Booker's gesture with the same scrutiny they applied to Musk's earlier action.</p>

He suggested the withholding might be a "glitch" or intentional, awaiting clarification after the leaders' conversation. This trade dispute occurs amidst other tensions between the U.S. and China, including military concerns regarding Taiwan and potential visa revocations for Chinese international students.

Piastri's victory extends his championship lead over Norris by 10 points, while Verstappen trails Piastri by 49 points due to the penalty and eventful final laps.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams has faced criticism for his comments following a libel victory against the BBC, where the corporation was ordered to pay â‚¬100,000 after a jury ruled it had libeled him. A 2016 episode of the BBCâ€™s Spotlight program alleged that Adams sanctioned the killing of Denis Donaldson, a Sinn Fein official unmasked as a British spy. Seamus Dooley of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) found Adams' remarks, including his intention to "put manners on the BBC," as chilling and unfair. The case has sparked debate about defamation laws and the relationship between journalists and Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland.</p>
