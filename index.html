          <p>Official data reveals that China's industrial profits experienced a 3% increase in April compared to the previous year, even amidst the pressures of U.S. tariffs and deflation. This cumulative profit growth follows a return to growth in the first quarter, reversing a trend of declines since the third quarter of the previous year. Despite this growth, manufacturing activity fell more than anticipated, hitting a 16-month low, while exports to the U.S. saw a significant plunge due to the imposed tariffs.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for making businessmen law enforcement officers. Jenkins was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in March, but Trump claims Jenkins was a victim of a "weaponized" Department of Justice. Federal prosecutors stated that Jenkins accepted $75,000 worth of bribes, while Jenkins maintained that there was no connection between the payments he received and the badges he handed out.

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes President Trump's demand that retailers like Walmart "eat the tariffs" on goods from China, arguing that this ignores basic economic principles. The author contends that Trump's call is unrealistic, as businesses cannot sustain operations if costs exceed revenues. The piece points out the contradiction between Trump's business background and his insistence that companies absorb cost increases, noting that such tariffs ultimately function as a tax on consumers. The article argues that businesses should be transparent about the impact of tariffs rather than engaging in wordplay to obscure the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, being overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets rising to a record high. Japan's gross external assets increased due to a weaker yen boosting the value of foreign-currency holdings, but Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The country increased its net external credit for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States. This article discusses the economic factors contributing to this shift in global creditor status.</p>
