          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Executive Orders Targeting "Woke" AI and Deregulating Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:01:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed three executive orders aimed at establishing the U.S. as a global AI leader while targeting what the administration calls "woke" artificial intelligence models. The orders seek to expedite the permitting process for data center infrastructure, promote the export of American AI, and combat perceived ideological bias in AI systems. This move is part of a broader administration campaign against diversity initiatives and reflects long-standing conservative grievances against tech companies. Critics express concern that the vaguely defined anti-woke directive could be used to arbitrarily target companies, while environmental groups warn about the impact of deregulating data center construction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has secured new trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines, a move analysts interpret as an indirect strategy to counter China's influence in Southeast Asia. The agreements, which eliminate duties on American exports to the two nations while imposing a 19% tariff on their imports to the U.S., aim to reshape regional supply chains and provide access to critical resources. While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the policy reflects a U.S. effort to contain China's economic power through strategic partnerships. However, experts note that Chinese firms are already deeply integrated in the region, increasingly localizing production rather than relying on transshipments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reveille X, the beloved collie mascot for Texas A&M, is recovering successfully after undergoing surgery to remove her right eye. University officials announced that the procedure was necessary following a glaucoma diagnosis that was causing the dog discomfort. Known as the "First Lady of Aggieland," Reveille X has been the university's mascot since the 2021 season. While she will need time to recuperate from her duties, her veterinary team expects her to make a full recovery and be back to her usual activities, such as attending classes and cheering on the Aggies, by the fall.</p>

          <p>A vegetation fire, named the Euclid fire, broke out in Chino Hills on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly grew to 120 acres within hours. The blaze, which started near the 71 Freeway and Euclid Avenue, jumped the freeway, forcing the closure of the major thoroughfare in both directions. Fire officials urged drivers to avoid the area as the fire continued to push towards the Prado Dam. While no evacuations were ordered, Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had the potential to grow to 500 acres before crews managed to halt its rate of spread by the evening.</p>

          <p>An Afghan interpreter, who saved a U.S. Special Forces officer's life multiple times during the war, has shared his story of feeling betrayed by broken American promises to its allies. After a three-year wait and with the help of the officer he rescued, the interpreter, "Amir," and his family received Special Immigrant Visas and resettled in the U.S. However, he now fears deportation amid the Trump administration's efforts to end legal protections for Afghans, including threatening the status of green card holders. Amir's story highlights the personal toll of shifting immigration policies and the "moral injury" felt by U.S. veterans who see their wartime allies face uncertainty.</p>

Experts worry that this trend could negatively impact the development of crucial social skills, as AI platforms often provide constant validation without the challenges of real-world relationships.

The men, who were recently freed in a prisoner swap, described being subjected to systematic beatings by guards, being held in isolation cells, and being cut off from all contact with their families and legal aid. Their testimony provides a rare and disturbing look inside the notoriously brutal prison, which they were sent to after the Trump administration alleged they were gang members, often with little to no evidence.

Despite this significant increase, the number falls far short of the administration's ambitious target of one million annual deportations, highlighting the operational challenges of such a large-scale effort.

The drug, which is used as an anesthetic for large animals like elephants, has been appearing in illicit drug markets, posing an extreme risk of accidental overdose due to its potency. While cases are still rare, U.S. deaths involving carfentanil have seen a significant increase over the past year.

Experts suggest that while the market remains competitive, especially for updated, turnkey homes, buyers may find more negotiating power with properties that have been on the market longer.

The strategy reflects the influence of tech executives who have close ties to the administration and have advocated for these changes.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer described the current stock market as a mix of positive and negative forces, advising investors to be "skeptical, but not cynical." On the positive side, he pointed to a less severe than expected trade deal with Japan and a strong earnings season from major companies. However, he also warned of negative signs, including speculative "froth" in certain stocks that reminds him of previous market bubbles like the dot-com bust and the 2021 meme stock mania. He suggested that while there are strong long-term themes like the data center buildout, there is also risky behavior that warrants caution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom during the first half of the year has dropped to its lowest point since 1953, when excluding the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown period. Data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders shows a 7.3% fall in car output and a 45% plunge in van production, attributed to factors like the closure of a major van plant and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs. While a new US-UK tariff deal and government EV grants may offer some relief, the industry body expressed skepticism about meeting long-term production targets without significant new investment in UK manufacturing.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are beginning their training camp with high expectations as a Super Bowl contender, but they face several significant concerns. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is starting camp with limited participation due to back soreness, a worrying sign for the team's most crucial player. The offensive line is also a question mark, with left tackle Alaric Jackson dealing with recurring blood-clot issues and right tackle Rob Havenstein recovering from double shoulder surgery. Additionally, the team is relying on an unproven cornerback group and must resolve a contract extension for star running back Kyren Williams to avoid potential distractions.</p>

The implosion wasted a stellar seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starter Tyler Glasnow. While the victory was celebrated, the game highlighted the team's most pressing issue: a struggling and overworked bullpen, which has posted a high ERA over the last month and threatens the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>An educational exhibit at Muir Woods National Monument has been altered, becoming the first known casualty of a Trump administration executive order targeting "unpatriotic" language at federal sites. The exhibit, installed in 2021, had added context to an existing sign to provide a more complete history, including the roles of Indigenous people and women, and the racist views of historical figures like John Muir. Following the president's order to remove content that perpetuates a "false reconstruction of American history," the additional information was removed. Former park staff who created the expanded exhibit criticized the move as an act of censorship that erases complex historical truths.</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Trump was informed by Attorney General Pam Bondi in May that his name appeared multiple times within the Department of Justice's files on Jeffrey Epstein. This meeting reportedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files to the public, a decision that sparked backlash from some of the president's supporters. The report notes that being mentioned is not an indication of wrongdoing and that the files contained unverified information about many public figures.

Although the official cause of the fire is still under investigation, Edison's CEO stated the program offers an expedited path for victims to be compensated fairly.

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to unseal grand jury transcripts from a 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the Justice Department's request did not meet the strict legal criteria required to bypass federal rules on grand jury secrecy. The decision is a setback for the administration's recent push for transparency in the case, which came after public pressure. This ruling specifically affects the Florida investigation and is separate from pending requests in New York concerning later probes into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
