          <h2>Former President Trump Denounces Epstein-Related Inquiries as a 'Hoax'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:32:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly dismissed the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation as a "hoax" and "scam" orchestrated by Democrats. He criticized his own supporters for pursuing the issue, stating he no longer wants their support and that they have been "duped." This response comes amid growing pressure from some Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, for the administration to release more files related to the case and provide greater transparency. Trump has continued to defend Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the matter, insisting all credible information has been released.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's predictions, largely due to a significant increase in trading revenue. The bank reported earnings of $2.13 per share on $16.79 billion in revenue, surpassing the expected $1.96 per share and $16.07 billion. Both the institutional securities and wealth management divisions showed strong performance, with CEO Ted Pick highlighting the firm's consistent earnings across different market environments. Despite the positive report, the company's stock experienced a slight dip following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump States Firing of Federal Reserve Chair is 'Highly Unlikely'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:28:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, just hours after reportedly asking Republican lawmakers for their approval to do so. The initial reports caused temporary volatility in stock markets and the U.S. dollar, which later recovered. Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, continuing his attacks by calling him a "knucklehead." The potential dismissal of a Fed chair, an unprecedented move that could undermine the central bank's independence, has drawn warnings from financial leaders about the risk of destabilizing the economy.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a volatile session after reports emerged that President Donald Trump was considering firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, causing stocks to briefly sell off and interest rates to jump. Markets stabilized after Trump later described the firing as "highly unlikely," tempering the immediate uncertainty. In separate business news, industrial power management company Eaton announced its acquisition of Resilient Power Systems, a firm specializing in energy solutions for electric vehicle charging depots. The move aims to bolster Eaton's exposure to fast-growing markets, including data centers and energy storage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 2.7% annual rate in June, marking its highest level since February and indicating a slight acceleration in inflation. On a monthly basis, the index increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for energy, food, and household furnishings. Economists suggest this uptick may reflect the early impacts of new tariffs, though core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained slightly below forecasts at 2.9%. The data reinforces expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

Her defense asserted that the shooting occurred while she was playfully mimicking a Bugs Bunny cartoon, a legal argument dubbed the "Bugs Bunny defense." This bizarre explanation created division among law enforcement officials even before the case went to trial, with some investigators reportedly finding her story credible. The case is notable for its unique defense strategy and the surprising twists that unfolded during the investigation and subsequent legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A new documentary has identified a person of interest in the cold case of Jodi Huisentruit, an Iowa news anchor who vanished in 1995. The ABC News documentary suggests Brad Millerbernd, the ex-husband of Huisentruit's best friend, may have been involved, based on tips and his resemblance to police sketches. Millerbernd, who has maintained his innocence and cooperated with police, lived a few hours from Huisentruit's apartment at the time. Despite this development and other recent leads, no arrests have been made in the three-decade-old abduction case, though authorities and Huisentruit's family remain hopeful for a resolution.</p>

Israel subsequently launched airstrikes on Damascus and the Sweida region, stating its goal was to protect the Druze population, a minority group with ties to Israel.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from consumers' credit reports. The ruling sided with credit industry groups, finding that the CFPB overstepped its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The now-vacated rule was intended to relieve approximately 15 million Americans of $49 billion in medical debt, which the CFPB argued is not a reliable predictor of creditworthiness. The decision is a setback for consumer advocates, although some states have enacted their own protections and major credit bureaus have voluntarily removed smaller medical debts.</p>

          <p>Recent threats by Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have raised significant questions about the legality and potential consequences of such an unprecedented action. While Trump has publicly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, legal experts and a recent Supreme Court opinion suggest the president lacks the authority to dismiss the Fed chair over policy disagreements. The Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently of political pressure to maintain economic stability, and any attempt to remove its leader could severely undermine investor confidence and roil global financial markets. The Trump administration is reportedly exploring legal workarounds, including accusations of mismanagement.</p>

          <p>A former New York City police commissioner, Tom Donlon, has filed a federal lawsuit against the city, Mayor Eric Adams, and top police officials, alleging a "coordinated criminal enterprise" at the highest levels of government. Donlon, who served for two months in 2024, claims he was sidelined after attempting to investigate systemic corruption and warning the mayor about his findings. The 251-page lawsuit also accuses the NYPD of falsely arresting his wife as an act of retaliation. This is one of several recent lawsuits filed by former officials making similar claims of corruption involving the Adams administration.</p>

          <p>Israeli warplanes conducted major airstrikes on the Syrian military's General Staff headquarters in Damascus, escalating a campaign against the Syrian government. The attack occurred as Syrian forces are engaged in heavy sectarian clashes with the country's Druze minority in the south. Israel has stated it is acting to protect the Druze community, though critics accuse it of using the unrest to destabilize its neighbor. The fighting in the Sweida region has resulted in hundreds of deaths, with both sides accusing the other of atrocities, further complicating the volatile situation in the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing serious questions over a major data breach in 2022 that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK assistance. The breach was concealed from the public by a super-injunction obtained by the previous Conservative government, which was only lifted this week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that former ministers have "serious questions to answer" about the failure and the subsequent cover-up. An emergency resettlement scheme for those affected has already cost £400 million, with hundreds of at-risk individuals and their families believed to still be in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>An experimental weight loss drug from Chinese drugmaker Hengrui Pharma has shown strong results in a late-stage trial, positioning it as a potential rival to popular treatments from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The weekly injection, HRS9531, helped patients lose nearly 18% of their body weight on average over 48 weeks, with no plateau in weight loss observed. The drug functions similarly to Eli Lilly's Zepbound by targeting both GLP-1 and GIP hormones. Hengrui plans to seek approval in China, while its U.S. partner, Kailera Therapeutics, will initiate global studies. (not investment advice)</p>

In a memo to staff, interim CEO Jason Droege stated that the company had expanded its generative AI capacity too quickly, leading to bureaucracy.

          <p>U.S. Central Command has announced that its partners, the Yemeni National Resistance Forces, intercepted a massive shipment of Iranian weapons intended for Houthi rebels. The seizure, described as the largest in the force's history, included over 750 tons of munitions, such as advanced cruise and anti-ship missiles, drone engines, and radar systems. CENTCOM stated that many of the systems were manufactured by a sanctioned company affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Defense. The interception is seen as a significant blow to the flow of Iranian military support to the Houthis, who have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea.</p>

          <p>A major review has concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism program missed opportunities to intervene in the case of Axel Rudakubana, who later murdered three children in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC, the independent Prevent commissioner, found that teachers had referred Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence. However, his case was closed each time because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for Prevent to broaden its focus to include individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without a clear ideological motive, to potentially avert future attacks.</p>

The four MPs were part of a larger group of 47 Labour rebels who voted against the government's proposed changes to the benefits system, ultimately forcing ministers to soften their plans. The suspended MPs stated they were acting in their constituents' best interests and could not support a bill that would make disabled people poorer.

          <p>Russia is escalating its attacks in Ukraine by equipping its Iranian-designed Shahed drones with larger and more destructive thermobaric warheads, according to Ukrainian military personnel. A Ukrainian air defender reported that the explosive payloads on these drones have more than doubled in size, from 40kg to 90kg, greatly increasing their destructive force. A first responder also noted a more frequent use of these weapons, which create high-temperature fireballs and devastating blast waves. The use of these controversial munitions on cheap, mass-produced drones allows Russia to inflict greater damage on both civilian and military targets.</p>
