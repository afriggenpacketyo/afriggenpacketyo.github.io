          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are engaged in urgent peace talks in Malaysia, hosted by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, to de-escalate a five-day border conflict that has claimed 35 lives and displaced over 260,000 people. The fighting, which began after a landmine explosion, has led to both nations recalling ambassadors and border closures, with ongoing clashes reported. International pressure, including from President Trump and the U.S. Secretary of State, emphasizes an immediate ceasefire, though Thailand expresses a lack of trust in Cambodia's sincerity. This conflict marks a rare military confrontation between ASEAN member states, prompting regional and global calls for a swift resolution to the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has lauded a new US-EU trade deal as a significant victory, claiming it will generate $90 billion in tariff revenue and involve the EU purchasing hundreds of billions in US energy and arms. This agreement, reached after tense negotiations, is seen as averting a damaging transatlantic trade war, though the EU still faces a 15% US tariff on many exports, a climbdown from previous rates. The deal highlights Trump's personal involvement in securing agreements and his commitment to renegotiating global trade relationships, following similar recent deals with Japan and other nations.

          <p>Nurses in England are expected to overwhelmingly reject their proposed 3.6% pay award, with results of a consultative vote due this week. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer as "grotesque," noting it's lower than increases for other public sector workers. This rejection, supported by a high turnout, sets the stage for a potential formal strike ballot in the autumn if ministers do not engage in further negotiations over the summer. The GMB union, representing other health workers, has also rejected the deal, signaling widespread dissatisfaction within the NHS workforce.</p>

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism charges and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder against 42-year-old Bradford James Gille, accused of a mass stabbing at a Walmart store. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife to injure five men and six women, including an employee, with victims ranging from 21 to 84 years old. Quick action by citizens, including an armed individual, helped contain the suspect before a deputy's arrival. While the motive remains under investigation by detectives and the FBI, all 11 victims are expected to survive, with conditions improving.</p>
