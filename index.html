        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has expressed cautious optimism for the industry's future. A recent bumper harvest in Spain has significantly lowered raw material prices by 50%, allowing the company to reduce shelf prices and stimulate consumer demand. This recovery follows a turbulent period marked by poor yields, extreme weather, and high inflation that caused prices to soar. The company now anticipates a more balanced market and plans to increase its investment in advertising to reinforce olive oil's status as a household staple.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China reported unexpectedly strong trade figures for July, with exports growing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% year-over-year, beating economists' forecasts. This performance suggests resilience in the world's second-largest economy, largely driven by increased shipments to alternative markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. However, exports to the U.S. continued to decline for the fourth consecutive month amid ongoing trade tensions and the looming expiration of a tariff truce. The data provides a significant boost to China's economic outlook, though concerns remain about the sustainability of this momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. administration's decision to increase tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could significantly impact certain sectors of India's economy, particularly gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles. The new levy was imposed due to India's oil trade with Russia, adding to a pre-existing 25% tariff. While the move affects a substantial portion of U.S.-bound exports, analysts note that key industries like IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted by the duties. The overall impact on Indian equities is expected to be partially insulated, though it may contribute to currency volatility and affect foreign investment flows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new, widespread tariffs on goods from over 90 countries have officially been implemented, aiming to reshape the global trading system. The levies vary, with manufacturing-heavy nations in Southeast Asia facing some of the highest rates, while major partners like the EU, Japan, and the UK have secured lower tariffs through negotiations. The administration also imposed a 50% tariff on India over its Russian oil purchases and threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips. While Asian stock markets remained relatively stable, the move introduces a new phase of analysis regarding long-term economic impacts.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor reported an 11% year-on-year drop in its quarterly operating profit, attributing a significant portion of the loss to the impact of U.S. tariffs. The Japanese automaker, which is the world's largest by sales volume, recorded a 450 billion yen loss directly related to the import taxes. Despite the profit decline, the company has experienced strong global demand and record sales, but it has revised its full-year operating income forecast downward. The situation reflects broader challenges for Japanese carmakers, who are absorbing higher costs to maintain their market share in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese financial experts assert that the country is successfully managing its significant local government debt, which has long been considered a major risk to global financial stability. Through a comprehensive debt-restructuring campaign, authorities have extended repayment periods and brought overall risks under control. Some analysts now suggest that the U.S. federal debt situation is comparatively more alarming. China's approach has involved swapping high-interest 'hidden' debt for lower-interest, long-term bonds, a strategy facilitated by the central government's ability to intervene and support local government finances, a structure different from the U.S. system.

          <p>A federal funding freeze at Harvard University, stemming from a dispute with the Trump administration, is threatening to derail years of critical scientific research. Scientists across various fields, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, have lost millions in grants, forcing them to halt studies, lay off staff, and shelve invaluable data. The administration's actions followed Harvard's rejection of demands from a federal antisemitism task force, which the university claims is a retaliatory campaign infringing on its independence. While Harvard has pledged $250 million of its own funds, researchers fear the interruption will cause irreparable damage to their work.</p>

He attributes his historic performance to a change in technique and his unique physical attributes. Despite advancements in sports science and footwear, no athlete has come closer than Christian Taylor's 18.21m jump a decade ago, leaving Edwards' remarkable feat unchallenged.</p>

This development comes on day 198 of a presidency that began with a vow to resolve the conflict within 24 hours.

The EA acknowledged it is 'highly likely' that a portion of the nearly 700,000 tonnes of waste tyres exported annually are diverted to illegal pyrolysis plants, which cause severe environmental damage and health risks. While campaigners welcome the move, they argue the new self-certification measures do not go far enough to close loopholes exploited by criminals.

The administration believes this will clarify its economic direction and spur domestic investment, but the move coincides with emerging signs of economic damage. Since the initial tariff announcements in April, data shows hiring has stalled, inflation has risen, and the U.S. trade imbalance has widened as importers rushed to bring in goods. Economists warn the tariffs could lead to a steady erosion of the economy rather than a sudden collapse, creating what one expert called 'fine sand in the gears.'</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, a metal commonly used to treat mood disorders, may play a crucial role in brain health and protecting against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally present in the body and essential for normal cell function. Experiments showed that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain aging and the buildup of plaques associated with Alzheimer's, while maintaining normal levels was protective. The findings suggest that beta-amyloid plaques deplete available lithium in the brain, creating a downward spiral, and open a potential new avenue for developing treatments.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old active-duty U.S. soldier, Taylor Adam Lee, has been arrested and charged under the Espionage Act for allegedly attempting to transmit classified national defense information to Russia. Federal prosecutors claim Lee, who was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, and held a top-secret security clearance, shared technical data on the M1A2 Abrams tank with someone he believed was a Russian government representative. He allegedly sought to exchange the sensitive information for Russian citizenship and discussed providing actual tank hardware. The arrest highlights the ongoing threat of espionage facing the U.S. military, including online recruitment by foreign adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to levy a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips and semiconductors, a move that could significantly increase the cost of electronics, cars, and appliances. The tariff will not apply to companies that manufacture their chips within the United States, a policy designed to incentivize domestic production. The announcement was made during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, where a new $100 billion U.S. investment from the tech giant was discussed. This tariff-based strategy marks a significant departure from the subsidy-based approach of the bipartisan CHIPS Act, favoring a punitive method to reshore the industry.</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring from the agency less than five months after returning from a challenging and prolonged mission aboard the International Space Station. Wilmore co-piloted the inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner, which was plagued by thruster failures and gas leaks, extending his planned eight-day mission to over nine months. Despite the difficulties, Wilmore consistently maintained that the crew was prepared for the risks of a test flight and not 'stranded' in space. His 25-year NASA career was distinguished by service on multiple spacecraft, and his retirement follows a pattern set by other astronauts after completing historic test missions.</p>

The article criticizes the petrochemical lobby for obstructing a global plastic pollution treaty while plastic contamination is found everywhere from Mt. Everest to human organs.

          <p>Japanese automaker Honda is rethinking its electric vehicle strategy following a massive quarterly loss driven by EV development costs and the impact of U.S. tariffs. The company took a $780 million charge related to its EV struggles, particularly in the competitive Chinese market, and noted it is not optimistic about the future of EVs. Despite healthy sales figures for its Prologue and ZDX models in the U.S., these were achieved through heavy incentives. To mitigate tariff impacts, Honda plans to increase prices and shift more production to its U.S. plants, potentially expanding to a three-shift operation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled a major $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally create 17,000 acres of new land over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricane storm surge. The decision, directed by the governor, came after strong opposition from local fishing communities who feared it would destroy their industry.

Researchers warn that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, making extreme rainfall events more intense.

Some London boroughs could see their funding fall by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The new system, set to be phased in from 2026, aims to redirect funds to more deprived areas and those with a higher share of lower-band council tax properties. While urban areas outside the capital like Nottingham and Wolverhampton are set to gain, the IFS warns the changes will redistribute around £2.1 billion in annual funding.</p>
