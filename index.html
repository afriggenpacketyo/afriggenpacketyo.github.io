The crew, consisting of two American astronauts, one Japanese, and one Russian, successfully completed their journey in a SpaceX Dragon capsule. During their 146 days in orbit, they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cellular behavior in microgravity. The mission also marked the replacement of the Crew-9 astronauts who had been previously stranded on the station.</p>

The order, a victory for Attorney General Ken Paxton who sued the PAC for alleged deceptive fundraising, will be in effect for two weeks pending a hearing.

          <p>A 30-year-old London-based entrepreneur, Lucy Rout, launched Haystack Dating, an in-person event series, after experiencing burnout from traditional dating apps. Citing negative experiences like ghosting and a decline in mental well-being, Rout designed events that use an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests for activities like cricket or rugby. This initiative taps into a growing trend of people seeking real-life connections, as data shows a decline in users for major dating apps. Rout's model emphasizes accountability and kinder interactions compared to the virtual world.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a major "gear shift" in his life. A genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the discovery prompted a shift in his motivations, focusing more on purpose, contribution, and living a healthier lifestyle to maximize time with his family. For the second season of his show, he took a more active role, exploring personal interests like learning the drums.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on small, affordable luxuries and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," includes purchases from makeup and collectibles to expensive concert tickets, often funded by cutting back on daily essentials. Analysts note this behavior is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional milestones like homeownership for younger generations. Experts predict this trend will persist for several years as global economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of the used car market has identified the top ten vehicles with the highest depreciation rates over a five-year period. The study found that an average 2025 model year vehicle retains only 54.4% of its original value. The BMW i3 leads the list, losing nearly 58% of its value, followed by the Nissan Juke and Nissan Leaf, which both lose over 51%. The list, which includes a mix of electric vehicles and traditional cars from brands like Volvo, Porsche, and Ford, highlights how initial popularity does not guarantee long-term value.

The administration froze $584 million in funding after the Department of Justice concluded that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent" to a hostile environment for Jewish students during campus protests in 2024. University officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom have condemned the move as "extortion," warning that such a payment would devastate the public university system.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump stated that a deal could be solved "very soon" and would involve "some swapping of territories," a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The announcement follows a report that Putin would agree to a ceasefire if Kyiv withdrew forces from the Donbass region, effectively ceding occupied territories. A former Latvian minister described the summit as a diplomatic victory for the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>An unexpected friendship has formed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently on a holiday trip in the UK, which began with a family stay at Lammy's official country residence. The two politicians, who come from different sides of the political spectrum, have reportedly bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods and their Christian faith. This personal relationship is seen by some analysts as a potentially important diplomatic channel, particularly given the personalized nature of foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Several protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct during a demonstration outside a federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Activists allege that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is operating a covert, overcrowded detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building, a claim the agency denies. The protesters demanded access for officials and journalists, holding a sit-in before police made arrests. The demonstration is one of several recent actions, fueled by footage shared last month allegedly showing poor conditions inside the facility.</p>

          <p>A wave of protests is taking place across the UK against the government's use of over 200 hotels to house asylum seekers, fueled by local safety concerns and online organizing. The article highlights how these demonstrations, sometimes involving far-right activists but often organized by local residents, are sparked by a lack of information and transparency from the government. The case of a man charged with sexual assault at one hotel has ignited wider debate. The situation underscores the political and social tensions surrounding the UK's strained asylum system and its impact on local communities.</p>

          <p>A new biography by author Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," presents a deeply unflattering portrait of Prince Andrew, likely sealing his fate for any return to public life. The book details his alleged arrogance, poor judgment, and extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with sources claiming the links began earlier than previously known. The biography portrays him as a figure obsessed with sex and money, while also exploring suggestions of a lonely and socially awkward person. The book is expected to further damage his reputation.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim alleging that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The claim, originating from a Facebook user purporting to be a retired pilot, is discredited by several facts. Reporting indicates that Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, with visitors arriving by helicopter or boat from a nearby island. Furthermore, the photo used by the claimant appears to be from a pilot costume sold online, and there is no public evidence to substantiate the claim.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to give workers access to asset classes that have the potential for higher returns but also carry greater risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While proponents say it could boost retirement savings, experts caution that these investments often have higher fees and complexity, and adoption by employers is expected to be slow.
