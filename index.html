          <p>AI-focused cloud infrastructure firm CoreWeave has announced its intention to acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion. The deal is aimed at expanding CoreWeave's control over power and real estate, giving it ownership of 1.3 gigawatts of capacity across Core Scientific's U.S. data centers. CoreWeave's leadership stated the acquisition will eliminate future lease obligations and enhance operational efficiency. The company may also choose to divest Core Scientific's cryptocurrency mining business, which constituted the majority of its recent revenue, following the transaction's expected closure in late 2025.

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a downturn on Monday, with losses accelerating after President Trump announced plans to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. This news overshadowed other market events, such as Amazon's upcoming extended four-day Prime Day sale, which is projected to boost online spending significantly. In technology news, data from Similarweb indicates that Meta's Threads is gaining on its rival X in daily mobile app users, showing 128% year-over-year growth. This increased engagement is seen as a positive sign for Meta's future advertising revenue as it seeks to monetize the platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters in eastern Germany have gained control over several large wildfires after a difficult weekend, particularly in the state of Thuringia. Concurrently, Poland has reinstated temporary spot checks at its border with Germany in response to stricter German controls, a move straining the Schengen visa-free travel zone. On the economic front, German industrial production saw an unexpected 1.2% increase in May, driven by the energy and automotive sectors, offering hope for a recovery. Meanwhile, public health officials reported over 2,000 drug-related deaths in 2024, highlighting a concerning rise in fatalities among young people due to synthetic opioids.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called on Brazilian authorities to cease the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, labeling the legal proceedings a "WITCH HUNT." Bolsonaro is currently on trial for allegedly planning a coup against his successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In a social media post, Trump defended Bolsonaro as a strong leader and compared the situation to his own legal challenges. President Lula responded by asserting Brazil's sovereignty and stating that no one is above the law, while other Brazilian officials criticized Trump's remarks as interference in their country's domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will implement 25% blanket tariffs on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, beginning August 1. The decision was revealed through letters posted on social media, which also warned against any retaliatory tariffs, threatening to add any new foreign duties on top of the 25% rate. This action effectively reimposes the administration's initial, more stringent tariff rates after a 90-day pause. The announcement led to a significant drop in U.S. financial markets, as investors reacted to the renewed trade tensions with two major economic partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a prominent cleric in Iran, publicly called for the execution of U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Friday sermon.

The sermon, which prompted chants of "Death to America" from the crowd, comes amid heightened tensions following a recent 12-day war between Israel and Iran and a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites.

The findings, detailed in a two-page memo, aim to dispel long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding his death and the extent of his criminal network.

The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to enable encrypted, ephemeral communication between nearby devices, forming local clusters to pass messages along. Designed to be censorship-resistant, Bitchat requires no central servers, phone numbers, or emails, ensuring user privacy and functionality even during internet shutdowns. This project aligns with Dorsey's broader vision for decentralizing technology, offering an alternative to mainstream messaging platforms controlled by large tech corporations and reliant on user data.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings from a $20,000 deposit in either a long-term or short-term certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, the analysis shows that long-term CDs ultimately yield more total interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 5-year CD at 4.20% would earn over $4,500, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% earns just $880. The article advises savers to consider their ability to lock away funds for the full term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Central Texas were caused by an extreme weather event that saw some areas receive upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge, fueled by remnant moisture from a tropical storm, caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the pre-dawn hours on Friday. The region, known as "flash flood alley," is naturally susceptible to such events due to its topography and soil composition.

          <p>In the wake of the devastating Texas floods that have killed over 90 people, questions are emerging about the adequacy and timing of emergency warnings. While the National Weather Service issued several alerts, including an emergency warning for Kerr County before dawn, many residents and local officials felt unprepared for the flood's severity. Some survivors reported not receiving alerts or not understanding their gravity, highlighting potential gaps in the communication system, especially in areas with poor cell coverage. The tragedy is now prompting scrutiny over whether budget and staffing cuts at the National Weather Service may have impacted forecasting and coordination efforts.</p>

          <p>Russia's Minister of Transport, Roman Starovoy, has reportedly died by suicide just hours after being dismissed from his post by President Vladimir Putin. According to Russia's state-run news agency, the 53-year-old fatally shot himself in his car on Monday. His dismissal followed a chaotic weekend for Russian air travel, with hundreds of flights canceled due to widespread Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after Starovoy's death was reported, a second, lower-ranking transport official also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest, adding to a string of deaths among high-profile Russian officials and business figures under unclear circumstances.</p>

Playing in front of former rival and eight-time winner Roger Federer, Djokovic dropped the first set 1-6 before rallying to win the match in four sets. The 38-year-old Serbian expressed relief at winning in Federer's presence, joking he had broken a "curse" of losing when his rival was watching.

          <p>Alex Cooper, host of the popular "Call Her Daddy" podcast, received a mixed reaction from the crowd at Wrigley Field after leading the seventh-inning stretch on Sunday. Her intentionally off-key and theatrical performance of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" was met with audible boos from many Chicago Cubs fans. While Cooper and her companions appeared to be enjoying the tongue-in-cheek rendition, it stood in stark contrast to the earnest, if imperfect, singing style popularized by the late broadcaster Harry Caray. The appearance was part of a special promotional takeover at the stadium, but the bizarre performance left many fans unimpressed.</p>

Thelma Stober, a survivor of the Aldgate blast, joined a victim's daughter in reading the names. Other events took place across the city, including at the sites of the four coordinated suicide attacks on the transport network, to remember the lives lost in the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A jury has been shown CCTV footage of a violent altercation at Manchester Airport where two brothers allegedly assaulted three police officers. The incident occurred in July of last year after police were called to a disturbance at a cafe in Terminal 2. Prosecutors claim Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and Muhammad Amaad, 26, resisted arrest and engaged in a brawl, throwing multiple punches and causing bodily harm to the officers. One officer testified that the suspects were using a high level of force and that he feared one was attempting to take his firearm during the struggle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK facing its third heatwave in four weeks, farmers are warning that the risk of devastating wildfires is dangerously high, describing the landscape as a "tinder box." Some agricultural leaders argue that land management policies incentivizing the removal of grazing animals, like sheep, have led to a build-up of dry vegetation that fuels fires. The National Farmers' Union has called for urgent reviews of these policies and better collaboration with fire services. The warning comes as data shows the area of land burned by wildfires this year has already surpassed totals for any year since 2012.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found a significant increase in handgun possession among teenagers in Florida. The research, which analyzed survey data from 2002 to 2022, revealed that general handgun carrying among adolescents rose by 65%, from 3.7% to 6.0%. The increase was most substantial among female students, middle schoolers, and white students. In contrast, the study found that carrying a handgun in school actually decreased by 60% over the same period. The authors suggest the findings indicate a need for earlier, tailored prevention strategies focused on handgun access for younger and more diverse demographics.</p>

Amid a second term marked by significant events like a military strike on Iran and a major domestic policy bill, the president's national approval rating hovers between 40% and 45%. The state-level data reveals a wide variance in public opinion, with the highest approval in states like Wyoming (69%) and West Virginia (68%).
