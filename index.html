          <p>A new study in the American Journal of Psychiatry reveals that more American adults with mental health needs are engaging in talk therapy, while the use of psychiatric medications alone has declined. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving only medication decreased, while the percentage receiving only talk therapy increased, particularly among those with depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. The expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of licensed counselors and social workers as providers have contributed to increased access to therapy, although affluent individuals have benefited the most.

          <p>The Social Security Administration reduced the benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries, but experts still warn of potentially "devastating" effects on individuals who rely on their benefits to pay for essential needs. The 50% withholding rate applies to Title II benefits, while the rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%. Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments, which can occur for various reasons. This article discusses the financial challenges faced by beneficiaries subject to benefit clawbacks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's policies, particularly his tariffs, could undermine the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency and lead to long-term economic consequences. Trump's erratic trade agenda has shaken global investors' confidence, leading to increased talk of "de-dollarization." A weaker dollar would reduce Americans' living standards and force the government to pay higher interest rates.

The tariffs aim to create good-paying factory jobs and sustain local communities.
