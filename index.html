          <p>Tesla's Vice President of Manufacturing, Omead Afshar, has been terminated by CEO Elon Musk, a move confirmed amid declining vehicle sales and a significant drop in the company's stock value. The dismissal of Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, adds to a series of recent high-level executive departures. This leadership change occurs as Tesla confronts heightened competition from other EV makers and reputational challenges partly linked to Musk's public activities. Afshar had previously been the subject of an internal investigation but was subsequently promoted.</p>

          <p>Lars Klingbeil, co-chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), has become Germany's new vice chancellor and finance minister in the conservative-led coalition government. The 47-year-old secured these powerful roles for himself during negotiations following the SPD's poor performance in the general election. His rise signifies an unusual concentration of power and has led to a significant reshuffle of the cabinet, with many long-serving SPD ministers being replaced. Klingbeil, who has a long career within the party, now faces the major challenge of analyzing and reversing the SPD's recent decline in voter support.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is engaged in conversations with reigning world champion Max Verstappen regarding a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but break clauses could reportedly allow for an early exit. A move could be appealing for Verstappen due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and potential advantages for Mercedes with the new engine regulations in 2026. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations may be influenced by the team's pursuit of the Dutch driver.</p>

This action follows similar scrutiny of DeepSeek in other European countries, including Italy and Ireland.

          <p>Recent reports and social media stories highlight a phenomenon of immigrants, some with deep roots in the U.S., choosing to leave the country, a trend sometimes termed "self-deportation." However, experts caution against viewing this as a widespread movement, suggesting it may be part of a political strategy to create an illusion of high deportation numbers. The article notes that for most undocumented immigrants, who are often long-term residents with jobs and families, leaving is not a viable option. A government program to incentivize voluntary departure has seen very limited uptake, underscoring the complexities and high stakes involved for individuals considering this path.</p>

          <p>The apparent victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral primary is being interpreted as a significant blow to the Democratic party establishment. This op-ed argues that Mamdani's success, achieved through a grassroots campaign focused on affordability, demonstrates the power of the party's progressive wing. The author suggests that the win is a rebuke to the passive, risk-averse leadership of mainstream Democrats, who have failed to match the energy of their voter base. Mamdani's triumph could inspire more progressive challenges to entrenched incumbents, signaling a potential shift away from the party's decades-long move to the right.</p>

This disclosure campaign from the White House aims to support President Trump's assertion that the program was "obliterated," contrasting with an initial intelligence assessment that suggested only a setback of a few months.

          <h2>Researchers Identify Rocks in Canada That May Be the Oldest on Earth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists believe they have identified the oldest known rocks on Earth, located in Quebec's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt. Using multiple dating techniques that yielded a consistent age, a new study estimates the rocks are approximately 4.16 billion years old. This finding helps settle a long-standing dispute over their age and places them in the earliest period of Earth's history, not long after the planet's formation. Studying these primordial rocks could provide invaluable insights into Earth's early development, including the formation of tectonic plates and the origins of life.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed on a framework for a trade deal, according to officials from both nations. While President Trump initially announced a signed deal, the White House and Beijing later clarified it as a framework agreement. The accord appears to center on increasing U.S. access to rare earth minerals, which are critical for high-tech manufacturing and dominated by China. This development follows a period of intense negotiations and postponements of massive tariff hikes, aiming to de-escalate the trade war that has impacted both of the world's largest economies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's recent reversal on planned welfare reforms is projected to significantly reduce expected savings, according to a new analysis. The original plan was set to save Â£5 billion annually, but the revised deal is now estimated to save only around Â£2 billion. Key changes, such as applying cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) only to new claimants, account for the bulk of the reduced savings. This fiscal shift, costing an estimated Â£2.5-3 billion, will likely require the government to find funds through higher taxes or other spending cuts to meet its borrowing targets.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have publicly questioned the Trump administration's claim that recent U.S. airstrikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Senators like Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant capabilities and equipment remain, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years or decades as the president asserted. They expressed concern that the administration's strong characterization could be misleading and provide a false sense of security. Republicans, however, largely defended the administration's assessment, stating the strikes were highly successful and severely damaged Iran's capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approach to presidential clemency has sparked a wave of pardon applications crafted specifically to appeal to his personal and political inclinations. Since retaking office, Trump has largely bypassed the traditional, nonpolitical Justice Department review process, instead granting pardons to political allies, supporters, and others who frame themselves as victims of a "weaponized" system. This has created what experts call a "free-for-all," encouraging prisoners to highlight shared grievances with the president, such as being victims of "political persecution," in hopes of securing their release.</p>

After being pushed to the brink of extinction, grizzly populations, particularly in the Yellowstone ecosystem, have recovered beyond their initial goals. This success has led to increased human-bear conflicts as the animals expand their territory. Proponents of delisting argue it's time to declare victory and return management to the states, while opponents fear that removing federal protections could quickly reverse decades of progress, especially amid political pressure to allow hunting.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan offered a sharp critique of her party, describing it as a disparate group that lacks teamwork and central leadership. In a speech, she argued the party is divided between those who see the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as merely survivable, leading to internal conflict. Slotkin urged Democrats to refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues like jobs, housing, and healthcare to reconnect with struggling Americans. Her comments reflect a growing debate within the party about its message and strategy following the 2024 election losses.</p>
