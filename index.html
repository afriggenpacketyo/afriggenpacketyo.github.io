Major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France are all expected to decline, reflecting ongoing market choppiness that saw bourses touch a two-week low earlier in the week. This follows a mixed session where French markets rallied on political developments, while U.S. stock futures remained stable after strong bank earnings. Investors are now awaiting key U.K. GDP data and earnings reports from major European companies for further direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to halt the country's purchases of Russian oil in the near future. This move is part of the U.S. administration's strategy to exert economic pressure on Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. An Indian government spokesperson described the discussions as "ongoing," emphasizing the priority of safeguarding consumer interests in a volatile energy market. The Trump administration has previously imposed significant tariffs on Indian goods, partly in response to India's trade with Russia, and is also pressuring other nations like China and Japan to follow suit.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the United States. The acknowledgment follows a series of deadly U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean, which the administration has justified as part of an armed conflict against drug cartels. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the move as an attempt at regime change, while some members of the U.S. Congress have raised concerns about the lack of transparency and the potential for escalating conflict without proper authorization.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has started a process that could bar HKT, a major Hong Kong telecommunications company, from accessing American networks due to national security risks. The agency cited HKT's ties to China, particularly through its part-owner China Unicom, which was similarly banned in 2022. The FCC has asked HKT to show cause why its authorizations, which permit the direct exchange of calls and data with U.S. carriers, should not be revoked. This action is part of a broader FCC effort under Chairman Brendan Carr to remove Chinese state-linked entities from U.S. communications infrastructure amid escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, scoring 22 points. He started the game by making his first five three-point attempts, quickly accumulating 18 points in the first quarter alone. Despite his strong showing, the Lakers ultimately lost the game 121-94, largely due to being outscored 37-8 in the final quarter. The game also saw starting forward Jarred Vanderbilt exit early with a left quad contusion, adding an injury concern for the team as they approach the regular season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing scrutiny after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped charges against two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China. The Director of Public Prosecutions stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a "national security threat" at the time of the alleged offenses, a new legal precedent required for prosecution. This has led to a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of withholding evidence to maintain positive relations with Beijing. The government insists the decision was solely made by the independent CPS.</p>

          <p>The European Union's push to become a global AI hub by tripling its data center capacity is creating conflict with the continent's growing water scarcity issues, particularly in southern Europe. Data centers require vast amounts of water for cooling, and their construction in arid regions like Spain and Greece is alarming environmental activists and farmers. Experts argue that policymakers are prioritizing technological advancement without adequately considering the environmental impact, raising questions about what happens if water shortages force these crucial facilities to shut down. Tech companies state they are innovating with water-efficient cooling technologies, but critics argue the full water footprint remains a major challenge.</p>

Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed skepticism about the legality of President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to police American cities, stating, "I don’t think it’s legal... for the National Guard to police Americans on American soil." She highlighted that unlike in states where governors control the Guard, the D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president. Bowser warned that using the military for local law enforcement is a "slippery slope" that could threaten American democracy.

          <p>Bookmakers have identified Irish singer CMAT and iconic band Pulp as the top contenders for this year's Mercury Prize, which honors the best album from the UK and Ireland. CMAT is the front-runner for her album "Euro-Country," while Pulp is a close second for their comeback record, "More." For the first time, the awards ceremony will be held outside of London, taking place in Newcastle as part of an effort to decentralize major music industry events. The move aims to better represent talent from across the nation and provide more opportunities for artists and industry professionals outside the capital.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army cult has called plans to distribute the group's multi-million-pound fortune to former members "shameful." An investigation revealed that 172 loyal former members will receive significantly larger payouts than the abuse victims compensated through a redress scheme. It is understood that some beneficiaries may include individuals accused of perpetrating or covering up abuse, a prospect survivors find "sickening." The Jesus Fellowship Community Trust, which is managing the assets, stated it cannot redirect the funds and must protect the identities of beneficiaries due to confidentiality agreements with victims.</p>

The scientist, who wished to remain anonymous, warned that the cuts would impede the nation's ability to respond to outbreaks and lead to preventable deaths. Her layoff is part of over 4,000 terminations across the federal government, which a federal judge has temporarily halted.</p>

His remarks contrast with calls from both Democrats and other Republicans for the individuals involved to resign. The national federation itself described the messages as "unbecoming of any Republican" and demanded that those responsible step down from their positions.</p>

This project is the latest in a series of aesthetic changes Trump has initiated in the capital, including a gilded White House makeover and a new ballroom. The president has already displayed renderings and a model of the proposed arch to donors and officials.</p>

          <p>The Last Dinner Party, winners of the BBC's Sound of 2024, are releasing their second album, "From The Pyre," which explores darker and more grandiose themes than their debut. The band, which rose to fame with the hit single "Nothing Matters," wrote much of the new material over a short period, reflecting on topics of love, death, and grief. Singer Abigail Morris revealed that one song, "The Scythe," originated from a chorus she wrote as a teenager about a breakup but later realized it was a rumination on her father's passing. The album showcases the band's growing confidence and musical complexity.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment, defined as being jobless for 27 weeks or more, has reached its highest level since 2022, affecting nearly 2 million people. Many job seekers report a brutal market, with some enduring extensive interview processes only to be rejected, forcing them to deplete savings and retirement funds. A labor economist attributes the trend to economic uncertainty stemming from the White House, exacerbated by the recent government shutdown and ongoing tariff policies. With initial unemployment claims also hitting a multi-year high, experts predict the job market will not improve in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A housing association chief executive in Oxfordshire has proposed a new model to address the UK's reliance on expensive hotels for housing asylum seekers. The plan suggests the government fund councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding them to the social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. This approach could drastically cut the cost per asylum seeker from £54,000 a year in a hotel to just £4,000 in social housing. The proposal comes as the government aims to close all asylum hotels by 2029 amid rising community tensions and crippling costs, which reached £5.5 million per day in October 2025.</p>
