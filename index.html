          <p>President Trump clarified on Tuesday that he does not intend to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's monetary policies and calling for lower interest rates. Trump's remarks followed concerns about the Fed's independence and potential upheaval in economic policy. Powell, nominated by Trump and renominated by Biden, has faced scrutiny for maintaining steady interest rates. Trump's administration had explored the possibility of dismissing Powell, but Powell himself stated he would not resign if asked. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting the food industry to voluntarily stop using synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal. This move stops short of an outright ban, relying instead on a "national standard and timeline" for the industry to switch to natural alternatives. The FDA Commissioner stated that the food industry is eager to remove artificial dyes. The International Association of Color Manufacturers expressed concerns about the proposed timeline.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are jointly lobbying the Trump administration against 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many auto suppliers are already in financial distress. The letter is addressed to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Auto executives and experts believe the tariffs are more dire for auto suppliers than automakers themselves.</p>

          <p>The Veterans Affairs (VA) department is instructing staff to report colleagues for instances of “anti-Christian bias” to a newly established taskforce, as part of the Trump administration's efforts to reshape government policy on religious expression.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America, citing the administration's decision as "arbitrary and capricious". The judge ordered the Trump administration to return Voice of America employees and contractors to their status before a March 14 executive order suspended their work. The order also covers the federally funded nonprofit news outlets Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The judge stated that the Trump administration was "likely in direct violation of numerous federal laws."</p>
