          <p>U.S. officials have expressed disappointment with Hamas' response to the proposed Gaza ceasefire, stating that it 'only takes us backward.' The core disagreement revolves around Hamas' demand for guarantees of a permanent end to the war, which has been a long-standing point of contention with Israel. The U.S. envoy, Steve Witkoff, has deemed the response unacceptable and insists that Hamas should accept the original framework for negotiations. This development raises concerns about the prospects for a swift resolution to the conflict and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>John Miller, a British man, has been indicted for allegedly attempting to smuggle U.S. military technology to China and organizing the harassment of a critic of Beijing, along with Cui Guanghai of China.

The indictment details how the pair allegedly targeted a U.S. resident for exercising free speech, including installing a tracking device on their car and destroying artistic statues.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Singapore-based scientist, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, is potentially vulnerable to hacking due to minute delays between its onboard lasers. Miller's analysis of data from communication between a ground station and Micius revealed that these delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers, compromising the security of quantum key distribution. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, but realistic QKD devices can be susceptible to side-channel attacks. This vulnerability raises concerns about the security of China's expanding quantum communication network. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. draft ceasefire proposal for Gaza, indicating a willingness to release hostages but requesting amendments to the plan. The group insists on a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and guaranteed humanitarian aid, conditions not fully addressed in the U.S. proposal. While not an outright rejection, Hamas' counterproposal includes releasing 10 living and 18 dead Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Caught between the dire conditions in Gaza and the threat of an escalated Israeli offensive, Hamas seeks to negotiate terms that ensure a lasting end to the conflict. The optimism score is 25.</p>

He is accused of hiring individuals to vandalize the journalists' homes with threatening messages. Spofford is scheduled to appear in federal court, and New Hampshire Public Radio has expressed gratitude to the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI for pursuing the case. The optimism score is 30.</p>
