          <p>A memorial service for Charlie Kirk is expected to draw over 100,000 attendees to the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, with significant security measures in place. President Donald Trump, who called Kirk "a great man," is scheduled to speak, along with other prominent figures like Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and members of his cabinet. The event has been designated a top-level security event by the Department of Homeland Security, equivalent to the Super Bowl. Attendees have been asked to wear patriotic colors to honor Kirk's life and influence, particularly among the nation's youth.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have jointly announced their official recognition of a Palestinian state, a move aimed at revitalizing a two-state solution. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that this decision is not a reward for Hamas, stating the terrorist group has no future role in a Palestinian state. The coordinated effort by the three nations adds to the over 145 countries that already recognize Palestine. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently rejected the move, vowing that a Palestinian state would "not happen" and labeling the recognition a reward for terrorism.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match, securing a 2-0 series victory in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, anchored the chase with a crucial 55 runs after England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, restricted Ireland to a target of 155. Despite an early injury scare, Cox's performance proved decisive in overcoming a sluggish start for the tourists. The victory in Malahide followed a win in the first match and a rain-out in the second.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on new Pentagon directives that significantly restrict journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters, stating, "Nothing stops reporters." The new rules, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, require journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release, or risk losing their press credentials. Press freedom advocates have condemned the policy as a form of prior restraint and a direct assault on independent journalism. The restrictions follow War Secretary Pete Hegseth's previous moves to limit media access within the Pentagon.</p>

          <h2>London Mayor Trials One-Day Pedestrianization of Oxford Street</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 12:48:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, calling it the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The event is a precursor to a larger plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, concerns were raised by local councillors and residents about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and reduced accessibility for individuals with mobility issues.

          <p>A manhunt is underway for Anmol Bhatia, a 27-year-old man accused of breaking into his former West Hollywood apartment and beating his ex-roommate's dog to death. Surveillance footage from inside the residence captured a masked individual entering the apartment and attacking the small dog until it was motionless. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Bhatia had been evicted from the apartment just days before the incident occurred. Investigators believe he also stole items from the home and are asking the public for any information regarding his whereabouts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump revealed in an interview that media executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely part of the American investor group poised to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The deal is intended to address national security concerns associated with the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants in the group, describing them as "American patriots." The new structure would reportedly feature a seven-member board with six Americans, and Oracle would manage the app's data and algorithm within the United States.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron condemned recent public criticism from U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." Kushner had accused Macron's government of failing to adequately combat antisemitism and linked France's pro-Palestinian foreign policy to increased risks for French Jews. Macron firmly rejected the assertion that disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies is inherently antisemitic, defending his decision to recognize a Palestinian state as a necessary step for a political solution. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner in a formal rebuke for interfering in the nation's internal affairs.</p>

          <p>Podcaster Joe Rogan recently misinterpreted a Washington Post article on his show, claiming it suggested Earth is currently in a cooling period. Meteorologist Chris Gloninger corrected this assertion, explaining that while the planet should be in a long-term natural cooling cycle, human activity has caused unprecedented warming over the last 150 years. Gloninger clarified that the rapid temperature increase is directly tied to carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, a rate of change not seen in natural cycles.

He noted that while the Fed projects two more cuts this year, this primarily affects overnight bank lending rates, not consumer borrowing costs like mortgages and auto loans, which are market-driven. Cohn highlighted Fed Chair Powell's acknowledgment of a "really cooling off" labor market, explaining that companies are reducing labor costs to maintain margins amid rising input costs from tariffs. He also commented on a new executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, suggesting it will ensure the program is used for highly skilled workers who cannot be hired domestically.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. This occurs by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that safeguard DNA. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, persistent stress speeds up this process, leading to faster biological aging. However, Epel notes that this damage can be mitigated through daily practices aimed at stress reduction and cellular restoration. She recommends simple, sustainable lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, and prioritizing deep rest to promote longevity.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are debating a potential reversal of their historic opposition to national ID cards, a policy they helped scrap in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially in light of modern digital ID systems like Estonia's. The discussion comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is reportedly planning to announce support for a digital ID scheme to help tackle illegal immigration. While some party members expressed civil liberties and data security concerns, a majority at the party conference supported a formal debate on the issue.</p>

          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the CHP, held an extraordinary congress to re-elect its leader, Ozgur Ozel, in a strategic move to protect him from a pending court case. The court is set to rule on whether to annul the results of the 2023 party congress where Ozel was first elected, a case critics view as politically motivated by President Erdogan's government. By holding a new vote, the party aims to provide Ozel with a fresh mandate, demonstrating his legitimacy and shielding him and other senior members from potential removal. The case underscores what many see as Turkey's slide toward autocracy.</p>

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on the use of plastic flying rings on its beaches to prevent harm to seals.

This local action follows similar moves by other councils and major retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury's. The council is also backing a campaign for a UK-wide legislative ban on the sale of these hazardous toys.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about feelings, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than lecturing, these parents validate their child's emotions, treat mistakes as learning opportunities, and teach how to repair relationships after conflict. The article emphasizes that creating an environment of emotional safety is the true foundation for developing strong communication and connection skills.</p>

Now 80, she explains that she left the marriage not from a lack of love, but from a need to find her own identity outside of being "Elvis' wife." The memoir details their unusually close post-divorce relationship, her business and acting careers, and her efforts to preserve Graceland as a legacy. Presley also discusses the profound grief of losing their only daughter, Lisa Marie, and her own plans to be buried at Graceland one day.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, strengthening their long-standing security partnership at a time of growing regional uncertainty. The agreement is seen as a move by Riyadh to diversify its security guarantees beyond its traditional reliance on the United States, especially amid increasing U.S.-China tensions. Analysts suggest that Gulf Arab states are becoming warier about the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner. China is likely to view this diversified partnership positively, potentially creating new opportunities for arms sales in the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>As premium travel credit cards increase their annual fees, credit expert Brian Kelly advises consumers not to automatically opt for no-fee cards, as they typically offer inferior rewards. He argues that even a modest annual fee can be worthwhile for the superior perks and points offered. Kelly identifies common mistakes such as hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to switch cards as one's lifestyle and spending habits change. He also recommends calling the card's retention department before canceling, as they may offer discounts or bonus points to keep your business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, and Australia highlights a fundamental challenge: the absence of a unified and functioning government. Palestinian politics has been divided for 18 years between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, with no elections held since 2006. The West Bank itself is fragmented by Israeli settlements, and Gaza has been devastated by war, making the Montevideo Convention's criteria for statehood difficult to meet. While international recognition is symbolically powerful, the article argues that formidable obstacles remain, including Israeli opposition and deep internal political divisions.</p>
