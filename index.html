          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that required hospitals to perform emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The guidance had mandated abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it served as a "stabilizing medical treatment." Abortion rights groups have criticized the move, accusing President Trump of reneging on a promise not to interfere with abortion access. The article outlines the legal and political context surrounding the decision.</p>
