          <p>Major Wall Street firms are showing increasing interest in stablecoins, viewing them as a transformative financial technology with a market potential estimated in the trillions. The article highlights how companies like ScaleAI and SpaceX already use stablecoins for global payments, drawing a parallel to the value creation seen with the advent of credit cards. Industry experts suggest that as regulatory clarity improves, traditional financial institutions will likely enter the market, which is essential for it to reach its projected multi-trillion dollar valuation.

          <p>Two London Metropolitan Police officers were dismissed for gross misconduct after strip-searching a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, at her school in 2020. The disciplinary panel found the search, conducted while the girl was on her period and without an appropriate adult present, was unjustified and humiliating. In a statement, Child Q expressed her ongoing trauma, stating she doesn't know if she will "feel normal again." The Met Police apologized for the incident and acknowledged organizational failings that contributed to the event.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would loosen capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, signaling a shift toward deregulation under the Trump administration. The move would allow major financial institutions to lend more freely and purchase more government bonds, a change long sought by Wall Street executives. However, the proposal has drawn dissent from some Fed governors, who argue that reducing these post-2008 crisis safeguards will increase systemic risk to the financial system.

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that while the U.S. remains in contact with Iran through intermediaries, no direct meeting has been arranged. The administration's stated goal for any future talks is to secure a non-enrichment, civilian nuclear program for Iran, with potential incentives like sanctions relief under discussion to bring Tehran to the table.</p>
