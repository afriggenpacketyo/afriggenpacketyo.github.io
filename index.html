          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary block. The proscription, which amends the Terrorism Act 2000, makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. This decision follows actions claimed by the group, including causing an estimated £7 million in damages to aircraft at an RAF base. The group's legal team argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience organization that does not advocate for violence.</p>

          <p>Five Manchester United players, including prominent forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, have reportedly informed the club of their desire to leave. Jadon Sancho, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia have also expressed their intention to seek opportunities elsewhere. The club has delayed their return for pre-season training to allow them time to explore their options. This development adds to the team's off-season challenges as it prepares for its pre-season tour and navigates a significant roster overhaul under manager Ruben Amorim, who had previously indicated a willingness to part with some of these players.</p>

          <p>Following the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, health experts are examining the significant physiological strain competitive eating places on the human body. Gastroenterologists note that participants can permanently stretch their stomachs, impacting normal digestion and gastric emptying. A 2007 study revealed a competitive eater's stomach can expand into a massive, distended sac, and ingesting such large quantities of high-sodium, high-fat food poses immediate risks like gastrointestinal distress and potential long-term issues like high blood pressure. While the body can recover, the practice carries dangers including choking and esophageal tears.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire, named the Madre Fire, has rapidly expanded in Central California, scorching over 52,500 acres within a day. This makes it the largest blaze in the state for 2025, prompting evacuation orders in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Fire officials report the fire is only 10% contained and currently threatens 50 structures, with the cause still under investigation. Interagency teams are coordinating a large-scale response, including air tankers and ground crews, to combat the fire's exponential growth under challenging weather and terrain conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which originates from a Shakespearean character and perpetuates stereotypes about Jewish people and greed, was used while discussing tax changes. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that words from leaders matter. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates.</p>

          <p>Germany has approved a significant increase in defense spending to modernize its armed forces, a move hailed by the arms industry as a major economic stimulus. However, some economists are skeptical, arguing the returns on military spending are low compared to investments in infrastructure or education. A study suggests that for every euro spent on defense, the economy might only see a 50-cent return, as military hardware does not generate ongoing economic value. While the spending could help struggling sectors pivot to defense production, it may primarily inflate arms companies' profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, mobile air defense units are engaged in a relentless nightly battle against waves of Russian Shahed drones. Using WWI-era heavy machine guns mounted on trucks, these territorial defense soldiers, many of them local civilians, attempt to shoot down the modern, low-cost suicide drones that terrorize the country. The article provides a ground-level perspective on the constant strain and psychological toll of the war, as these defenders face an overwhelming and technologically superior threat day after day. Their fight is a crucial, albeit often unseen, part of Ukraine's broader defense effort.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated he feels "politically homeless" in a Fourth of July social media post, criticizing the Democratic party for moving away from a culture that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship.

He expressed a preference for political candidates who focus on raising everyone's standard of living rather than on eliminating billionaires.

          <p>A 90-day pause on extensive U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new trade agreements are not finalized, sharply higher duties could be imposed on imports from dozens of countries, potentially fueling inflation and harming financial markets. The Trump administration has announced new pacts with China, the U.K., and Vietnam but has indicated it does not plan to extend the deadline for others. Experts believe some compliant nations may get extensions, while others could face steep tariff hikes next week. (not investment advice)</p>

Shelton expressed initial frustration with the suspension but later found humor in the situation, noting he had told the umpire he only needed 60 seconds to close out the victory, a goal he nearly met upon resumption.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade pact with Vietnam includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% "transshipping" tariff on products rerouted through Vietnam from other countries, primarily targeting China. Chinese manufacturers have increasingly used Vietnam to bypass hefty U.S. tariffs, significantly increasing Vietnam's trade surplus with the U.S. However, economists note the deal raises complex questions about enforcement, as defining what constitutes transshipment versus legitimate local assembly will be challenging for Hanoi. The move signals a broader U.S. strategy to use bilateral trade deals to curb China's economic influence. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's primary demographic consists of young adults, not the young children targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart's increasing reliance on overseas sales, which now account for a significant portion of its revenue, is expected to cushion any potential impact from domestic policy changes. The brand's success highlights the "dopamine economy" trend, where consumers seek affordable exclusivity and the excitement of surprise.</p>

The move, which involved Moscow removing the Taliban from its list of outlawed organizations and accepting credentials from a new Afghan ambassador, was welcomed by China. While the Taliban hailed the decision as a historic step and a positive message to the world, some former Afghan officials and analysts expressed concern. They noted that legitimizing a regime with a poor human rights record serves strategic interests over international norms and is unlikely to bring financial relief to the Afghan people.</p>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the British imposition of martial law in 1770s Boston and contemporary discussions about military presence in U.S. cities. The author argues that while taxes like the Stamp Act ignited conflict, it was the escalating military occupation under the Coercive Acts of 1774 that transformed colonial resistance into a full-scale revolution. By dissolving local governance and deploying an army, Britain provoked fear and anger, leading to events like the Boston Massacre and the battles at Lexington and Concord. The piece serves as a historical reminder of the perils of military overreach in domestic affairs.</p>
