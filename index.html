          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of 2025, with temperatures predicted to soar to 34°C (93°F) over the weekend. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for all of England, warning of potential strain on healthcare services. This prolonged period of hot weather has also prompted an "extreme wildfire warning" in Scotland. While not expected to break the year's record high, the event highlights a trend of more frequent and intense heatwaves, which scientists link to climate change and which pose significant risks to both human health and wildlife.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old man was stabbed to death on a street in the affluent Knightsbridge area of west London. The incident occurred outside the Park Tower Hotel, though the hotel confirmed no guests or staff were involved. Police and paramedics responded to the scene, but the victim was pronounced dead from his injuries. While no arrests have been made, authorities are investigating robbery as a possible motive but are keeping an open mind. The event has prompted an increased police presence to reassure the local community.</p>

          <p>A new wave of protests in Kenya, largely led by Gen Z activists, is taking a severe emotional and psychological toll on participants. Young demonstrators report experiencing constant fear, anxiety, and trauma due to violent crackdowns by police, which have resulted in numerous deaths and injuries. Psychologists observe a form of "collective trauma" affecting not only those on the front lines but the wider community. Despite the mental health crisis, many young Kenyans feel compelled to continue protesting against government policies, economic hardship, and police brutality, viewing it as a necessary fight for a better future.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has announced his intention to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and undocumented immigrants. The judge plans to certify a class action lawsuit and issue a preliminary injunction, stating the deprivation of citizenship would cause irreparable harm. This legal challenge is one of several across the country contesting the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The ruling comes after a Supreme Court decision limited previous nationwide injunctions, prompting opponents to refile cases to block the policy's implementation.</p>

This significant turnaround is largely attributed to its relative financial independence from Washington D.C., a key factor in this year's rankings due to looming federal budget cuts. The state's economy is less reliant on federal funding and has a smaller federal workforce compared to others, contributing to its improved economic outlook. However, the state still faces challenges, including high business costs and the potential impact of federal cuts to its research sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

While Liberia's foreign minister stated no offense was taken, the exchange was seen by some as reflecting a lack of awareness about the West African country's history and culture.

          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the director of the Heart O' The Hills camp and one of the victims of the Texas floods, made a final, frantic phone call to her brother as floodwaters rose in her home. Her brother, Jeeper Ragsdale, believes that this early morning alert, which he then used to wake others at his own camp, helped save at least five lives. Jane, who had been with the camp for nearly 50 years, was described as a beloved figure whose life was dedicated to her work. Her story is one of both immense tragedy and final heroism in the face of an unprecedented natural disaster.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential ramifications of Christian Horner's departure as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team, particularly concerning star driver Max Verstappen. While Horner's exit removes a point of tension related to past allegations, the driver's decision to stay or leave will likely hinge on performance. The team has fallen behind McLaren competitively, and there are concerns about its new in-house engine program for 2026. The new team boss, Laurent Mekies, faces the immense task of stabilizing the team, retaining Verstappen, and addressing the car's performance issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, citing the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as an "international disgrace." In a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Trump also alleged unfair trade practices and ordered an investigation into Brazil's digital trade policies. Lula responded by stating that Brazil is a sovereign nation and would retaliate against any tariff hikes. The move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions, uniquely tying them to the legal fate of a political ally.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far in 2025, marking the highest number of infections recorded in 33 years. The majority of cases are linked to a large outbreak in West Texas, which resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the resurgence of the highly contagious virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the safe and effective MMR vaccine as the best protection against the disease.</p>

The committee also examined espionage, cyber attacks, and Iran's nuclear program, urging the government to move beyond "crisis management" and consider proscribing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.</p>
