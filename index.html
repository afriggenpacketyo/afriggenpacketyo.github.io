          <p>Tax cuts promoted by the Trump administration are heightening concerns about debt and deficits among bond investors, potentially impacting interest rates for consumers and businesses. The rise in Treasury yields, particularly the 10-year and 30-year rates, reflects growing unease over the government's fiscal path. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty.

The editor found that the absence of social media apps led to more intentional and frequent communication with friends and family, resulting in deeper connections and increased spontaneity. While the experiment had its challenges, such as stilted texting and missing out on social events, it ultimately led to a more fulfilling social life and improved attention span.

The home improvement retailer narrowly missed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly sales but surpassed earnings estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted that investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped the retailer navigate near-term uncertainty in the housing market. Lowe's expects total sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion for the full year and projects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's Labour Party has reversed its decision to means-test the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, a policy that had been widely criticized and blamed for poor local election results. The reversal seeks to appease anxious Labour MPs who felt the policy was a significant political misstep. While some argue the policy was flawed from the start, others believe the government failed to make a positive case for it. The move is seen as potentially embarrassing for Rachel Reeves, who initially announced the policy, and raises questions about the government's economic and political judgment.</p>

          <p>West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to UK health officials, though the risk to the general public is considered "very low." Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. While there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK, the detection is not unexpected as the virus is already widespread in Europe. Experts say that climate change and other factors are pushing mosquitoes and the diseases they carry further north, potentially bringing non-native species and infectious diseases to the UK.</p>

The study simulated a U.S. Air Force penetrating counterair operation and found the B-52 to be the top threat across all combat phases. The researchers noted that the U.S. B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs, each equivalent to 300 tonnes of TNT, could cripple core A2/AD facilities and critical nodes.</p>
