          <h2>Proposed Legislation Seeks to Regulate Stablecoins as a Mainstream Payment Method</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 16:38:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House is considering the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill that has already passed the Senate, to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital currencies aim to reduce the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin by pegging their value to stable assets, most commonly the U.S. dollar. The legislation would define stablecoins legally, set consumer protections, and allow banks and credit unions to issue their own, potentially making them a more mainstream and secure form of payment. Proponents argue this could lead to faster, cheaper transactions, while major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring how to integrate them into their services.

          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution date for Robert Roberson, a death row inmate convicted of the 2002 murder of his two-year-old daughter. The prosecution's case was based on what was then known as shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that has since faced scientific scrutiny. Roberson's legal team is appealing for a new trial, arguing that new evidence from pathologists indicates the child's death was a tragic accident, not a homicide. Despite these ongoing appeals and support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, the Texas Attorney General's office pushed for the execution date to be set after numerous previous delays.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates and issued a positive forecast for the remainder of 2025. CEO Scott Kirby noted that the world feels "less uncertain" and that travel demand is recovering after a weaker-than-expected start to the year, particularly for domestic flights. The airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year, a more confident outlook than the dual scenarios it provided in April. Despite strong premium revenue, the company's overall revenue of $15.24 billion fell slightly short of expectations, with domestic unit revenue declining by 7%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A summer fishing trip in Waycross, Georgia, ended in tragedy when two teenagers, 18-year-old Joey Nelson Jr. and 19-year-old Randall Martin III, were fatally struck by lightning. The two were returning to their vehicle during a severe thunderstorm when the strike occurred. Family members found them deceased next to the car, which also appeared to have been hit, after they failed to return home as expected. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is conducting an autopsy to confirm the cause of death. Community fundraisers have been established to support the families of the two young men, who were described as being deeply loved.</p>

          <p>Shares of online firearms retailer GrabAGun fell more than 20% during their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which counts Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Trump Jr. rang the opening bell at the NYSE, celebrating the public listing of a gun company as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The newly merged company, trading under the ticker PEW, raised $179 million in gross proceeds from the deal, which represents another instance of the Trump family and allies backing politically conservative-aligned businesses.

The president claimed, without evidence, that the controversy is a Democratic scheme and that any Republicans pursuing it have been duped.

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its policies. This move is part of an effort to resolve a dispute with the Trump administration, which has frozen $400 million in federal grants over allegations that the university failed to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The IHRA definition is controversial, with critics arguing it can be used to suppress legitimate criticism of Israel by conflating it with antisemitism. Columbia's decision follows similar actions by Harvard and is seen by some as a concession to government pressure that could impact academic freedom.</p>

          <h2>Rising Inflation Poses Threat of Higher Credit Card Interest Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in the annual inflation rate to 2.7% is raising concerns about the future cost of borrowing, particularly for credit card holders. Since most credit card APRs are variable and tied to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, persistent inflation could lead the Fed to keep interest rates high or even raise them further. This would likely cause credit card rates, already averaging over 21%, to remain elevated or climb higher, making it more difficult for consumers to pay down debt. The article advises that individuals with high-rate balances should proactively explore options like balance transfers, personal loans, or negotiating with their card issuers.

          <p>For the first time in years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has resumed transferring inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Twenty inmates were handed over in May and June after the Trump administration secured federal judicial warrants, a method that circumvents local sanctuary policies. These policies generally prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with civil immigration enforcement but allow for transfers in response to criminal warrants. This development signals a new tactical approach by the administration to increase deportations in a region with strong sanctuary laws, raising concerns among immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced legislation to impose restrictions and transparency requirements on donations to presidential libraries. The move follows several large, multi-million dollar payments to President Trump's future library from corporations like Paramount, Disney, and Meta as part of legal settlements. The proposed Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act would cap contributions, ban donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and delay fundraising until a president leaves office. Proponents argue the bill is necessary to close loopholes that allow such donations to be used as a potential tool for corruption and bribery.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged four Louisiana law enforcement officials, including two active police chiefs, in a scheme to fraudulently obtain U.S. visas for immigrants. The officials are accused of conspiring with a local businessman to fabricate false police reports claiming that immigrants were victims of armed robberies. These falsified documents were then used to apply for U visas, which are reserved for victims of certain crimes who assist law enforcement. Prosecutors allege the officials were paid $5,000 for each falsified report, creating a suspicious pattern of robberies that never actually occurred. The charges include conspiracy, visa fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering.</p>

This diplomatic push comes as a new poll shows the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained support, now polling at 25%, just two points behind the leading conservative CDU/CSU bloc.

After British authorities contacted him, his rejected application was reportedly overturned, and he is now in the UK.

          <p>President Trump publicly downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling such a move "highly unlikely" unless for reasons of fraud. This statement came just hours after a senior White House official told reporters that Trump had told Republican lawmakers he intended to fire Powell soon. The president has been openly critical of Powell for not lowering interest rates, which he believes is hindering the economy. The conflicting messages created market uncertainty, with Trump also suggesting the Fed's $2.5 billion headquarters renovation could be a potential justification for removal, adding to concerns about political pressure on the central bank's independence.</p>
