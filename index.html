          <p>Researchers in China have engineered the world's smallest and lightest wireless robot that can transform its shape to navigate various environments. Inspired by Lego bricks, the microrobot utilizes a "morphable actuator" to convert energy into force, enabling it to move on land and in the air. The team from Tsinghua and Beihang universities suggests that this versatile robot could be used in complex situations, such as disaster rescue operations. The researchers emphasize that their robot boasts the smallest size, lightest weight, and fastest ground movement speed compared to other known wireless land-air robots.</p>

          <p>A recent UN report reveals that global development progress slowed in 2024, raising concerns about the erosion of recent gains. The Human Development Index (HDI) report highlights that the post-pandemic recovery is losing momentum, with stagnating life expectancy, income growth, and an increase in ongoing conflicts. The report warns that cuts to international aid, particularly led by the United States, will exacerbate these issues. The report also emphasizes the importance of equitable access to artificial intelligence to prevent further divides between wealthier and poorer countries.</p>

          <p>The UK government is contemplating restricting visa applications from countries with high rates of visa overstays and asylum claims, including Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. The Home Office believes some individuals abuse the system by switching from work or study visas to asylum claims to gain permanent residency. While critics argue the impact on overall asylum numbers will be minimal, proponents assert it aims to reduce perceived abuses of the system.

The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties. However, e-commerce and supply chain experts suggest that the companies are agile and have contingency plans in place, including accelerating localization strategies and onboarding American sellers.

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced an 8% surge after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company's revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly exceeding analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to consumer uncertainty. Despite macroeconomic challenges and tariff uncertainties, the group confirmed its 2025 outlook, forecasting sales to align with the previous year.</p>

The implementation of such a tariff on international productions remains unclear, given that many films involve production in both the U.S. and other countries.

          <p>Gianluigi Donnarumma's performance is under the microscope as Arsenal prepares to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.

Donnarumma's form has been inconsistent, with moments of brilliance in the Champions League contrasted by mistakes in domestic games. Arsenal needs to score to advance, making Donnarumma's performance a key factor in the outcome.</p>

          <p>Ferrari is facing questions about its performance in the current F1 season, particularly after the Miami Grand Prix. The team's struggles to optimize new tires have led to poor qualifying results, and the car's overall pace is slower than expected. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledges the need for improvements and hopes that upcoming upgrades and stricter regulations on front wing deflection will make a difference. Despite the challenges, Ferrari remains confident in its ability to progress with upgrades, similar to its successful efforts in previous seasons.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito has been admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a medical examination following an earlier checkup that revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. The 91-year-old will undergo a series of tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital.

          <p>President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China casts doubt on the country's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan, despite previous orders to be prepared by 2027. The removal of defense ministers and senior People's Liberation Army officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, raises questions about the competence and reliability of military commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers may weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with time to strengthen their defenses.</p>

          <p>There is a shift occurring in China, where the children of senior officials are increasingly choosing to follow their parents into the public sector, a trend that contrasts with the previous preference for lucrative private sector roles. This reversal is attributed to the Communist Party's tightened regulations on officials and their families, part of its anti-corruption efforts, and a slowing economy. Government jobs are now viewed as more appealing due to their security and stability amid increasing constraints on personal choices in the private sector.</p>
