          <p>A small Cessna 550 plane crashed into a military housing neighborhood in San Diego, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. The plane, which originated from Teterboro, New Jersey, and stopped in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego, struck power lines before colliding with a house. San Diego officials reported that approximately 100 people have been displaced and 10 buildings have been damaged due to the crash and subsequent fires. The NTSB and FAA are investigating the cause of the crash, with a preliminary report expected in two weeks, as investigators work to document the accident site and recover the aircraft.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, primarily driven by rising rice prices. This figure exceeded economists' expectations and has kept inflation above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated potential interest rate hikes while closely monitoring the impact of U.S. tariffs. Economists anticipate a future easing of core inflation due to lower crude oil prices and the appreciation of the yen.</p>

          <p>During road construction in Lubbock, Texas, ancient bones of megafauna, or large mammals, have been discovered, exciting archaeologists. The Texas Department of Transportation announced the find, noting that such discoveries are not unusual in the region. Among the finds is at least one giant ground sloth, identified by its distinctive tooth, with possibilities of mammoth or mastodon remains as well. If evidence of human settlement alongside the megafauna is found, it would be a first for a TxDOT project, potentially halting construction temporarily.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, an event criticized as a pay-for-play scheme. Hundreds of investors, including some from overseas, invested heavily in the coin to gain admission to the gala, with funds potentially benefiting the Trump family directly. Critics, including some Republican lawmakers and cryptocurrency industry advocates, condemned the event as an opportunity for the president to improperly benefit from his position.

The Prince of Wales emphasized the importance of the series in bringing awareness to the risks these rangers face, noting that approximately 1,400 rangers have died in the past decade. He hopes the series will inspire people to recognize the value and importance of conserving the natural world, much like Attenborough's documentaries have done for decades.

The analysis of popular TikTok accounts reveals that many teens and tweens are using anti-aging products with ingredients like retinol and vitamin C, which dermatologists warn can cause irritation and damage. Data shows that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion on skincare and makeup in 2023, exceeding the spending of households with teenagers.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, testified at an asylum hearing that he fears persecution if deported, citing potential threats to his life and family. Khalil, detained in Louisiana for two months, argued that he has been mislabeled as a terrorist sympathizer and faces danger due to his international prominence. Witnesses testified that Khalil would be at risk if deported, with one expert estimating a 30-40% chance of him being targeted and killed. A Homeland Security Department spokeswoman suggested Khalil use the CBP Home app to self-deport.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, a painter who became known as the Bagel Lady for her bagel-based art, has died at 87. Blau began creating bagel necklaces and other items on a dare from her husband, eventually turning it into a successful business. She sold her creations at Bloomingdale's, wrote a children's book called "The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane," and designed bagel-themed products for various companies.

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from the consequences of violating court orders. The provision is included in the tax and spending cut bill and aims to curb the power of federal courts to issue injunctions blocking Trump's executive actions. Democrats argue the measure would rob courts of their power by stripping away consequences for officials who ignore judges' rulings, while Republicans contend it's meant to discourage frivolous lawsuits.</p>
