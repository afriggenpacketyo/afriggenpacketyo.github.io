          <p>Famed Australian crocodile wrangler Matt Wright has been found guilty of lying to police and pressuring a hospitalized witness following a fatal helicopter crash in 2022 that killed his co-star. Prosecutors argued Wright tried to tamper with evidence, including falsifying flight records and lying about fuel levels, fearing blame for the crash, which investigators attributed to the helicopter running out of fuel due to likely not being refueled. Wright, known from National Geographic and Netflix shows, pleaded not guilty but was convicted on two counts of perverting the course of justice. He maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, delivered on his 46th birthday, describing it as devastating for everyone involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK businesses are expressing significant concern and facing uncertainty due to new US taxes on low-value parcels, effective from Friday. The Trump administration's removal of the "de minimis" exemption means parcels under $800 will now be taxed, potentially increasing costs by $30-$50 per $100 order and adding shipping provider fees. Small businesses, like hand-dyed wool company Nellie and Eve and skincare brand Yendy Skin, report halting US shipments or exploring manufacturing in the US due to the lack of clear upfront costs for customers. The Federation of Small Businesses is advocating for government support, warning that many firms may cease exporting to the US, while some argue the change promotes fair competition for domestic businesses.

          <p>Russian missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 23 people, including four children, and wounded dozens, causing outrage among European leaders. The attacks, the deadliest on the capital since July, also damaged the EU's delegation office and the British Council in central Kyiv, with two missiles hitting within 50 meters of the EU office. Ursula von der Leyen condemned the strikes as a "grim reminder" of Russia's intent to terrorize Ukraine, while UK Prime Minister Starmer accused Putin of "sabotaging hopes of peace." Ukrainian President Zelensky called for new, tough sanctions, emphasizing Russia's choice of "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" amidst US-led diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipating a mixed open as investors await key inflation data from France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the flash August reading for the euro area. US personal consumption expenditures price index data is also expected, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish speech, which has led to an estimated 85% probability of an interest rate cut next month, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Despite a largely negative week influenced by French political drama and Nvidia's earnings, the regional Stoxx 600 index is on track for its first back-to-back positive month this year. Spirits maker Remy Cointreau adjusted its expected operating profit impact from US tariffs downwards after a US-EU trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have unveiled and successfully tested a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone that strikingly resembles the "Gimbal" UFO footage declassified by the US Navy in 2021. This experimental aircraft features a radical, toroidal aerodynamic design with an elliptical, ring-like wing and four integrated rotors, appearing like a flying spindle rather than a conventional drone. The design aims to improve endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight, representing a significant shift in advanced aerospace technology. While still experimental, this development could reignite discussions about advanced aerial phenomena and military capabilities.</p>

Jansen, who has been DJing F1 events since 2014, notes the sport's shift under Liberty Media towards a more entertainment-focused experience, with his sets often going viral. Despite the festive atmosphere, the Zandvoort race is nearing its end on the calendar, and rising ticket prices are impacting attendance at some Verstappen stands, leading fans to question the repeated experience.</p>

          <p>Cambricon, a Chinese AI chip company dubbed "little Nvidia," has warned investors of substantial risks after its Shanghai-listed stock surged 533% in a year, nearly doubling in the last month alone.

The company cautioned that its stock price might be deviating from current fundamentals and reminded investors of its vulnerability to supply chain risks due to US export restrictions. Cambricon and some subsidiaries are on the US Commerce Department's Entity List, potentially adversely affecting its operating performance and posing substantial risks to investors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investigators revealed the Minneapolis school attacker, Robin Westman, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and harbored hate towards various groups, including the Jewish community and President Trump. Westman killed 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski and injured 18 others at a church school before dying by suicide. Officials confirmed Westman, a former student whose mother worked at the school, used legally purchased firearms and left a hate-filled note with anti-Catholic, anti-religious, and anti-Trump references. The FBI described the attack as "domestic terrorism motivated by a hate-filled ideology," leading to calls for assault weapons bans from local lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador and now facing criminal prosecution and potential deportation to Uganda, have asked a federal judge to bar top Trump administration officials from making "baseless public attacks" against him. They argue that statements from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, labeling Abrego Garcia an "MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator," violate his right to a fair trial. The motion contends these inflammatory remarks could taint any jury pool and hinder his defense, as officials continue to post allegations on social media despite a previous order to abide by court rules.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned, citing concerns over political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines. Dr. Debra Houry, Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stepped down after Director Susan Monarez's ouster. They argued that decisions were made without scientific data, evidence reviews were altered, and public health was being "weaponized." The officials criticized a lack of direct communication with HHS leadership and warned that current conditions could harm public health and compromise safety, sending a "bat signal" about the agency's direction.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on the future of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, potentially triggering political paralysis weeks after a ceasefire with Cambodia. Paetongtarn, in power for just a year, faces accusations of poor ethical standards and undermining the military, stemming from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen. In the call, she reportedly referred to Hun Sen as "uncle" and a Thai military commander as her "opponent" while discussing border tensions. If removed, she would be the fifth prime minister in 17 years to be ousted by the court, highlighting Thailand's long-standing political instability.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has experienced months of turmoil, marked by mass layoffs, numerous resignations, and significant vaccine policy shifts under HHS Secretary Robert F.

Roles, including floristry and hairdressing tutors with salaries up to £39,000, were criticized by Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp as "perks" that divert resources from deportations. Home Office Minister Seema Malhotra deemed some roles unnecessary and ordered their removal. Mitie, which manages Europe's largest immigration removal center, stated these services contribute to detainees' well-being, citing a report that highlighted their impact on managing detention stresses amidst previously reported poor conditions, drug use, and violence at the facility.</p>
