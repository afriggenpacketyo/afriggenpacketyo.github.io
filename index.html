          <p>Delta Air Lines is replacing auxiliary power units on more than 300 of its Airbus jets to address incidents of toxic fumes entering the cabin. These fume events, caused by oil leaks into the airflow system, have been linked to health issues like brain injuries in crew and passengers across various airlines. While the upgrades are nearly complete, experts note that main engines can also be a source of leaks, and a more permanent fix from Airbus would only apply to new aircraft. The issue highlights a long-known problem within the aviation industry regarding air quality safety on commercial flights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many consumers are struggling with high-interest balances. For those with significant debt, such as $20,000, credit card debt forgiveness, or settlement, is presented as a viable option. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing the debt by 30% to 50%. While this can offer substantial savings and a faster path to becoming debt-free compared to making minimum payments, it can also negatively impact one's credit score and may have tax implications.

          <p>Mark Francis Ford, a former Catholic priest who also served in the administrations of two Louisiana governors, has been arrested on charges including first-degree sexual assault and second-degree kidnapping. The allegations stem from his time ministering to children with disabilities in New Orleans, with the accuser, now 31, stating the abuse began when he was around 10 years old. Ford was apprehended in Indiana and awaits extradition to New Orleans, a city whose archdiocese has been dealing with numerous clergy abuse claims. If convicted on the most serious charge, Ford faces a mandatory life sentence.</p>

          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have had only a minor impact on the monthly payments for home equity loans. A $20,000 home equity loan currently has monthly payments ranging from approximately $194 for a 15-year term to $246 for a 10-year term, only slightly lower than before the rate adjustments. Despite the modest change, these loans remain an affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards due to their lower, fixed interest rates. The article suggests they can still be a strategic choice for homeowners, offering stability and potential tax advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs, including a 50% levy on kitchen cabinets and a 30% tax on upholstered furniture, justifying the move on national security grounds. This rationale, typically reserved for industries like steel or computer chips, has been met with skepticism from trade policy experts, who question how furniture imports could pose a security threat. The move was made under Section 232, a provision that allows the president to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The decision has created uncertainty and raises questions about the administration's expansive definition of national security in its trade policy.</p>

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of lying to Congress has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and legal observers, who label it a "dangerous abuse of power." Critics argue the prosecution is politically motivated, pointing to the fact that a U.S. attorney was reportedly forced out for finding no grounds to indict before being replaced by a Trump loyalist. While President Trump hailed the indictment as "justice," figures like Senator Mark Warner and Representative Adam Schiff described it as a blatant weaponization of the Justice Department to settle political scores and punish critics.</p>

Tensions escalated dramatically after Trump's election, with Comey confirming an FBI probe into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, leading to Trump firing him in 2017.

The indictment alleges that from 2009 to 2019, Rubin engaged in non-consensual and brutalizing sexual acts with women in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse described as a "sex dungeon." Prosecutors claim Rubin and his assistant, Jennifer Powers, spent over $1 million operating the trafficking network and used non-disclosure agreements to threaten victims. Rubin, who was previously found liable in a 2022 civil sex trafficking case, faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Despite a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the article suggests that opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in early October can still be a strategic move for savers. By acting quickly, savers can lock in a fixed interest rate of around 4.50% before another potential rate cut at the end of the month, allowing interest to begin compounding immediately. With the likelihood of a rate reduction high, banks may preemptively lower their offered CD rates. Therefore, proactive savers are encouraged to secure a favorable rate now to maximize their returns in a declining interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives mistakenly released a largely unredacted version of Representative Mikie Sherrill's military service records to a political opponent's ally. The released documents contained sensitive personal information, including her Social Security number and home addresses, in a potential violation of federal privacy laws. The National Personnel Records Center acknowledged the "egregious blunder," attributing it to a technician not following procedures, and has apologized to the congresswoman. The incident occurred as Sherrill's opponent in the New Jersey governor's race was scrutinizing her record regarding a 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal.</p>

Another document lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on Epstein's private jet in May 2000. These files were released by the House Oversight Committee and also show contact with other high-profile individuals.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card delinquencies on the rise, it is crucial for consumers to understand the timeline of consequences for late payments. While a payment is technically late the day after it is due, most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is at 30 days past due, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. Consequences escalate further at 60 and 90 days, with potential penalty APRs and more aggressive collection efforts, underscoring the importance of proactive communication with creditors if facing financial difficulty.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a weak and evasive tactic in debates over free speech and "cancel culture." Whether used by the right or the left, this approach deflects from a principled discussion of liberal norms by focusing on the perceived inconsistencies of the opponent rather than the merit of their ideas. The author contends that while many people are inconsistent in applying free speech principles, a decade-long debate has occurred within the left about its own illiberal tendencies. Ultimately, presuming all opponents are hypocrites is a way to avoid defending one's own principles on censorship and repression.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent figure in the Black Liberation Army and a symbol of Black resistance, has died in Havana, Cuba at the age of 78. Born JoAnne Byron, she became a leading voice in Black nationalist movements in the 1970s before being convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, a charge she always denied. In 1979, she escaped from prison and was later granted political asylum in Cuba, where she lived for decades.

Critics, including comedians Marc Maron and Zach Woods, argue that participating in the event helps the Saudi government "whitewash" its record of severe human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human Rights Watch has urged performers to use their platform to advocate for free speech and detained activists. The controversy highlights the ethical dilemma artists face when engaging with regimes known for repression, especially when substantial financial compensation is involved.</p>

Elliott, who was 17 at the time, immediately called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming and had been sleepwalking when the incident occurred. With no apparent motive or history of conflict between the deeply close siblings, his defense is centered on parasomnia, a sleep disorder.
