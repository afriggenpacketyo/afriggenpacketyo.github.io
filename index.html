          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping prison for nearly two weeks.

His attorney argues that these charges are an abuse of power and that Abrego Garcia is not the leader of an international smuggling conspiracy.</p>

          <p>The public has taken to social media to react to the escalating feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, with many users seeing it as a "catfight." Experts suggest that the engagement, while entertaining, distracts from larger political issues and reflects public dissatisfaction with the current state of politics. Social media users have posted memes, jokes, and serious commentary on platforms like X, Truth Social, and BlueSky, with some urging the two to reconcile and others gloating over the conflict. The feud, sparked by disagreements over Trump's budget cuts, has stirred political bases and the general public alike.</p>

The proposal would have charged manufacturers fees for gas furnaces and water heaters based on compliance with sales targets for electric models. Opponents argued the rule would penalize consumers and burden the electrical grid, while supporters claimed it was necessary for achieving clean air standards.

The couple's initial optimism about adopting a baby is tested when they face cultural misunderstandings and unfortunate events in the Italian countryside. Despite the commitment of the actors, the movie's tone shifts into body-count humor, which doesn't fully blend with its themes of perception and privilege. The film attempts to turn the filmmakers' personal adoption experiences into a silly horror comedy, but it only sporadically succeeds.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo's campaign for New York City mayor received a surprising endorsement from state senator Jessica Ramos, a former rival who had previously criticized his mental acuity and record of sexual misconduct allegations. Ramos, who once called Cuomo a "corrupt bully," now believes he is best positioned to protect the city and confront the Trump administration. The endorsement has been met with dismay from Ramos's progressive allies, who view it as a betrayal of her values. Cuomo, the current frontrunner, is competing against democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani and incumbent Eric Adams.</p>

The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages and $100 million each in punitive damages. The legal action follows pardons or commutations granted by Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the country.

Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for agreeing to return Garcia.

Fornnarino, who works at the VA in Denver, Colorado, said that while politicians in Washington debate permanent staff reductions, essential healthcare positions are being left vacant. Private providers operated with little oversight, they wrote, and “are not required to demonstrate competency in diagnosing and treating the complex care needs of veterans nor in understanding military culture, which is often critical to providing quality care for veterans”.</p>
