          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, a significant boost for its foundry business. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, does not name the counterparty, citing the need to protect trade secrets, though analysts speculate it could be Qualcomm or Tesla. This contract is crucial for Samsung as it aims to compete with industry leader TSMC and mass-produce its next-generation 2-nanometer chips, especially after facing recent struggles in capturing AI-related demand.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on trade, establishing a 15% US tariff on most European goods and averting a larger trade war. The agreement is viewed as a significant political victory for President Trump, though it is not a complete defeat for the EU, which avoided a threatened 30% rate. In return for the new tariffs, the EU has reportedly agreed to increase investments in the US and purchase billions in American energy and military equipment, rebalancing the trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to function correctly during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system should have sent high-level "Take Action" warnings to ten million people, but only 469 were sent for the first major quake because the algorithm severely underestimated its magnitude. After adjusting its detection algorithms, a simulation showed the system would have worked as intended, but the initial failure highlights the limitations of such technology in real-world disasters.</p>

          <p>In a heartfelt essay, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler shared his memories of Ozzy Osbourne's final performance weeks before the rock legend's death at 76. Butler recounted being shocked by how frail his longtime friend had become, needing assistance to move and singing from a chair during rehearsals. Despite his condition, Osbourne delivered a powerful closing set from a throne on stage, a moment Butler described as a strange but incredible final homage from fans and fellow musicians.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, a move that could lead to strike action later in the year. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque" for being lower than increases given to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. With turnout for the consultative vote expected to be high, the RCN is demanding that ministers re-enter negotiations to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for the mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK, citing growing concerns over the importation of animals with minimal health or behavioral vetting.

          <p>The Israeli military has implemented a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting within three populated areas of Gaza to create secure corridors for humanitarian aid. This measure is intended to help the United Nations and other agencies address a deepening hunger crisis, as experts have warned of an imminent famine. While aid agencies welcomed the move, they stressed that it is insufficient and that a complete ceasefire is the only way to avert a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe across the entire territory.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant and influential musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. A Harvard-educated mathematician, Lehrer rose to fame in the 1950s and '60s with his witty, subversive, and meticulously crafted songs that targeted everything from politics and nuclear war to the Catholic Church. He largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his teaching career, but his work left a lasting legacy that inspired generations of comedians and songwriters.</p>

The site has become a powerful symbol of regional Tamil pride, fueling a conflict with the federal government over the interpretation of India's ancient history.</p>

          <p>A 20-year investigation led by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully located a Skyvan PA-51 airplane that was used for "death flights" during Argentina's military dictatorship. The plane was used to drop drugged, living prisoners into the Atlantic Ocean. By tracking the plane to the U.S. and uncovering its flight logs, the investigators provided irrefutable evidence that was crucial in convicting the pilots for crimes against humanity, turning the aircraft into a witness to history.</p>

The author argues that the market is reacting with short-sighted frustration and failing to see the long-term value in the company's planned three-way split and its dominant position in key industrial sectors like aerospace and automation. The article suggests the sell-off is an overreaction and that the company's fundamentals remain solid for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>
