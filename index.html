          <p>James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting and then deleting an Instagram image of seashells arranged to spell "86 47," a phrase used by critics of President Trump. The post was perceived by some, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, as a call for the assassination of Trump, who is the 47th president. Comey removed the post, stating he didn't realize the numbers' association with violence and opposed violence of any kind, but the incident has drawn significant scrutiny and a formal investigation. The article highlights the sensitivity surrounding political rhetoric and potential threats against public figures. </p>

          <p>A strike by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen has shut down New Jersey Transit's rail network, impacting tens of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan region. Negotiations between the union and NJ Transit broke down over pay raises, with the union demanding parity with other regional railroads. NJ Transit's bus system will continue operating, and the agency has hired private buses, but they can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced riders until next week. The strike is the first by transit workers in the state since 1983, and officials are urging commuters to work from home and employers to offer flexibility. </p>

          <p>Nissan is contemplating sharing its global manufacturing plants with its Chinese partner, Dongfeng, as part of a broader restructuring effort. This comes as the company faces financial struggles, including significant job cuts and factory closures, due to weak sales in key markets. The potential collaboration aims to optimize production and navigate challenges in the competitive Chinese car market. Nissan recently reported an annual loss, further exacerbated by tariffs imposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly strategically selecting federal jurisdictions to file politically charged cases, hoping to find sympathetic judges. Conservatives often file challenges against the Biden administration in small Texas courts with Republican-appointed judges, while liberals have targeted courts in the 9th Circuit and Massachusetts. The Supreme Court is considering whether a single federal judge should be able to issue nationwide injunctions, potentially limiting the power of individual judges to dictate national policy. The article highlights the growing concern that the public views circuit judges as extensions of the political process. </p>

Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs but testified that his personality changed over time, becoming violent and jealous.

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year due to a sharp decrease in exports. The contraction was worse than economists had anticipated, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies, particularly tariffs, have negatively impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. Despite these concerns, domestic demand showed some strength, and analysts expect a reasonable trade deal with the U.S. in the coming months, which could alleviate some of the tariff pressures. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering large-scale deals to sell advanced chips and AI technology to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. These deals, negotiated by administration officials with ties to Silicon Valley, have sparked debate about whether the U.S. is outsourcing the AI industry to the Middle East. Concerns have been raised about potential risks to national security and the possibility of the technology benefiting China. The deals are part of a broader effort to foster American AI companies by expanding their reach overseas. </p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a megabill to enact President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, increased military spending, and stricter immigration enforcement. The bill proposes significant changes to Medicaid, clean energy programs, and food stamp benefits, while also raising the debt ceiling. Major tax cuts would primarily benefit the wealthy, while funding for health, nutrition, and education programs would be reduced. The bill faces internal divisions among Republicans, particularly over Medicaid cuts and the state and local tax deduction. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly larger than existing wild horses. The study highlights multiple migrations and genetic exchanges between the two continents between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering the scope of federal judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions against President Trump's policies, particularly concerning birthright citizenship. The court is examining whether a single judge should have the authority to block presidential policy for the entire country. The case stems from Trump's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, which contradicts the 14th Amendment. The justices are debating whether to narrow the scope of injunctions to only apply to the parties involved in the lawsuit. </p>
