          <p>A 10-year-old girl has died from injuries sustained in a sailboat crash near Miami Beach, becoming the third child fatality from the incident. The sailboat, part of a summer camp, collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay, which also killed a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old. The tragedy has deeply affected the local community, with the Miami Yacht Club and the family's synagogue expressing profound grief. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash, which involved a camp counselor and five children, to determine how the collision could have been avoided.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has changed his stance on actress Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad, calling it "fantastic" after being informed she is a registered Republican. The ad campaign, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had previously sparked a mix of online criticism and praise. Some critics found it tone-deaf, while supporters viewed it as a rejection of "woke" advertising. The discussion highlights the increasing intersection of celebrity culture, marketing, and political affiliations in public discourse, with various political figures weighing in on the matter.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled state legislature from achieving a quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. The proposed map, which Democrats label a "Trump gerrymander," could grant Republicans up to five additional U.S. House seats. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent members from their positions if they do not return. The Democrats argue that Republicans are prioritizing a political power grab over providing disaster relief for recent catastrophic floods, turning victims into political hostages.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for significant travel disruptions as Storm Floris is expected to bring high winds, prompting the Met Office to issue an amber weather warning for most of Scotland. The warning, effective Monday, highlights a potential "danger to life" from the severe conditions, with gusts predicted to reach 60-70 mph in exposed areas. In anticipation, train operators like LNER and Avanti West Coast have advised against travel to northern regions, and ferry services have been cancelled. This is the sixth named storm of the season, arriving unusually in August.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced that his government is prepared to compile a supplementary budget to counteract the economic effects of U.S. tariffs.

While a recent trade deal with the U.S. offers some relief, uncertainty remains over tariff cuts for automobiles, a key export. The potential stimulus package, which could reach 10 trillion yen, highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing economic support with fiscal responsibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices fell on Monday as investors engaged in profit-taking following a significant rally on Friday. The previous surge was triggered by weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, which increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. The nonfarm payrolls report showed slower job growth, boosting the perceived likelihood of a rate cut to 81%. While the dollar's stabilization contributed to the minor pullback in gold, analysts suggest that ongoing trade tensions and the prospect of lower interest rates could limit further declines for the precious metal.

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to enhance their survivability against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters. This "terminal evasion" system would allow the drone to perform sudden, high-G maneuvers in the final moments before an anticipated impact, making it difficult for even advanced missiles to track. Digital simulations detailed in a Chinese defense journal suggest this technology could increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a veteran insider of the Trump administration, has left her position as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Her departure is notable as she is the highest-ranking official to leave voluntarily during the second term. Mailman, who served throughout the first term, was considered a key figure in establishing the operations of the second administration. She reportedly plans to start a government affairs firm but will continue to serve as a special government employee to finalize some of her ongoing policy work.</p>

          <p>Approximately 30 Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled to Illinois to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The move, reportedly supported logistically by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, is a direct protest against a map they claim is a "Trump gerrymander" designed to create five new GOP-leaning seats. The Democrats accuse the Texas governor of holding disaster relief hostage to force the vote through. This drastic action could result in daily fines and potential arrest for the absent lawmakers under a 2023 state law.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for what is believed to be the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption followed a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake in the region and was itself accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude tremor. Officials confirmed the ash was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean, away from populated areas, and a tsunami warning for parts of Kamchatka was later lifted. There is a discrepancy among sources regarding the exact date of the last confirmed eruption.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, reportedly negotiated for the release of billions in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The requested funds included money for the NIH, the Global Fund, and various UN programs. Sources indicate a deal was close to being reached to confirm about 20 nominees before President Trump personally rejected the agreement. The failed negotiations highlight the intense political maneuvering in Washington, with Trump accusing Democrats of "political extortion" and Schumer blaming Trump for scuttling the bipartisan progress.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has indicated that the new tariff rates imposed on over 60 trading partners are "pretty much set" and are unlikely to be negotiated down. The statement follows a White House executive order establishing a baseline 10% tariff on all imports from dozens of countries, effective August 7. While some trade partners like the EU and South Korea secured deals, others like Canada face higher rates on certain goods. Greer asserted that the President's goal is to fix the terms of trade to address the U.S. trade deficit, even if it complicates relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's plan to build a new, sprawling embassy in London opposite the Tower of London has ignited a major controversy over security, espionage, and human rights. Opponents, including Hong Kong dissidents and local residents, fear the site could be used to harass political opponents and pose a security risk due to its proximity to the city's financial district. Concerns have been raised that China could tap into sensitive data cables, a risk highlighted by security experts. The UK government has taken over the final decision from the local council, placing it at the center of a complex diplomatic and national security debate.</p>

          <p>A recent report highlights the substantial costs associated with egg freezing, a procedure growing in popularity among women seeking to preserve their fertility. The average out-of-pocket cost for a single cycle, including retrieval, freezing, and storage, is estimated to be between $12,000 and $13,000. Since doctors often recommend multiple cycles to increase the chances of a future successful pregnancy, the total expense can become tens of thousands of dollars. While some employers are beginning to offer coverage, the majority of women must bear the high costs themselves, making it a significant financial undertaking.</p>

CEO Demis Hassabis explained that this technology represents a significant step toward building a "world model" that can understand and simulate our physical reality. The generated worlds can be used for entertainment, but have a more profound application in training AI agents and robots. By learning in these near-infinite simulated environments, AI could acquire new skills more efficiently before being applied to real-world tasks.</p>

In an interview, he suggested that the massive influx of money from both sides is effectively a "vote of no-confidence" in the court's ability to remain impartial. Hagedorn stated that people increasingly view the court as an extension of politics, and it is the justices' duty to prove them wrong by applying the law fairly. He also commented on the court's long-standing "culture issue" regarding internal divisions.</p>

He suggested that while trade frictions will likely continue, both nations recognize they have economic "chokeholds" on each other, which should impose some limits on hostility. Sachs advised that from a long-term perspective, China should focus on expanding exports to markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and Europe.
