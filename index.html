            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press journalists from covering events in the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other restricted areas due to the administration's disagreement with the AP's editorial stance on renaming the Gulf of Mexico. The judge stated that blocking access based on viewpoint is a violation of the First Amendment. This decision comes after the AP sued the White House for curtailing their access following their refusal to adopt the president's preferred name for the Gulf. The ruling emphasizes that while the White House can control access, it cannot discriminate against journalists based on their expressed views.</p>

            <p>Businesses are warning that President Trump's latest tariffs, which significantly raise import duties, could lead to freight being abandoned at ports as companies struggle to afford the increased costs.

While some companies are pausing shipments to assess the situation, others anticipate being forced to reject incoming goods, potentially disrupting supply chains and leading to goods being auctioned off or destroyed.

            <p>Federal judges in New York and Texas have taken steps to block the removal of five Venezuelans, identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, from the United States. The judges issued temporary restraining orders to allow the men to challenge their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely invoked law. Civil liberties lawyers argue that the government's identification methods are unreliable and that the use of the Alien Enemies Act is unlawful. The cases highlight concerns about due process and the application of wartime laws to immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose "major" tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., reversing a previous decision to exempt the sector from his reciprocal tariffs. The move aims to incentivize drug manufacturers to relocate production to the U.S. However, pharmaceutical industry leaders warn that the tariffs could hurt drug research and development and potentially increase drug prices for patients. The announcement has sparked debate about the impact of tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry and the potential consequences for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

His legal team contends that he has been subjected to a "bespoke process" that is inferior to the security provided to other senior royals. The government maintains that the decision to adjust his security arrangements was justified given his decision to step back from royal duties and live abroad. The case raises questions about the balance between public safety and the allocation of resources for royal security.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that China's response to President Trump's sweeping tariff plan could include the sale of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a move that could destabilize the US housing market. If China, one of the largest holders of US MBS, decides to sell its holdings in retaliation, mortgage rates could rise sharply. This, coupled with the Federal Reserve's current policy of letting MBS roll off its portfolio, could put significant pressure on the housing market. This scenario highlights the potential vulnerability of the US economy to foreign policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
