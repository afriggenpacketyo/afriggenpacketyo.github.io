          <p>A House committee has refused to grant immunity to Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, for her testimony regarding sex trafficking. Maxwell's lawyer had requested immunity, advance questions, questioning outside prison, and a delay until her conviction appeal was resolved, or clemency from President Trump. The committee emphasized the need for oversight into federal sex trafficking law enforcement and Epstein's case. Separately, Trump explained he ended his friendship with Epstein because he "stole" Mar-a-Lago spa workers, including Virginia Giuffre.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has significantly lowered its 2025 sales growth forecast for its obesity drug, Wegovy, citing competition from cheaper compounded alternatives. These pharmacies are legally allowed to create drug copies when official versions are in short supply, a status Wegovy previously held. The company, which also announced a new CEO, plans to pursue legal strategies to combat this practice. Critics argue Novo Nordisk is misrepresenting compounding pharmacists to excuse its reduced earnings outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building, which killed four including an NYPD officer, was reportedly an attempt to target NFL offices. Mayor Eric Adams stated the gunman, Shane Tamura, carried a note referencing CTE, a brain disease, and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura, a former high school football player, took the wrong elevator bank, leading to the shootings at Rudin Management. The NFL has advised New York employees to work from home and increased security.</p>

          <p>Overnight and early morning Russian air strikes in Ukraine have resulted in at least 25 deaths, including inmates at a prison in Zaporizhzhia and civilians queuing for aid in Kharkiv. A hospital in Dnipropetrovsk also sustained a strike, killing three, including a pregnant woman. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the attacks, urging "tough" sanctions against Russia. The strikes occurred as Russia claimed to be advancing deeper into Ukrainian territory, while Ukraine reported its own drone attacks in Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly keen on constructing a large ballroom at the White House, a long-held ambition predating his presidency. He views it as a necessary upgrade from the current practice of using outdoor tents for large state dinners, which he dislikes.

While no final decisions are made, White House aides consider the project a certainty, aiming for a space that can accommodate a thousand people.</p>
