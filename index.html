          <p>Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson is set to join Bayern Munich on a loan deal that includes a substantial option to buy. The German club will pay an initial £13 million loan fee and holds a £56.2 million purchase option for the 24-year-old Senegalese player. Jackson, who has already agreed to a pre-contract with Bayern, saw his opportunities at Chelsea diminish after the arrival of new summer signings. The move comes after a period where his performance statistics, particularly his conversion rate of major chances, were below expectations for a top-tier striker.</p>

          <p>A Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a lower court's ruling, dealing a significant blow to Donald Trump's trade policies by challenging his authority to unilaterally alter America's tariff schedules. The decision confirms a three-judge panel's judgment that the president cannot single-handedly reshape the country's tariff system without congressional approval. This ruling sets the stage for a potential major showdown at the Supreme Court over the extent of presidential power in matters of international trade and economic policy. The article notes this as a check on executive authority. (not investment advice)</p>

Police Scotland confirmed that the driver and two passengers of the Ford Fiesta were pronounced dead at the scene late Thursday night. First Minister John Swinney and other local officials have expressed their condolences to the families and the community.

          <p>A worldwide movement to enhance online safety for children is fueling a new wave of artificial intelligence-powered technologies designed to protect minors from harmful content. Spurred by legislation like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, which imposes a duty of care on tech firms, companies are developing and implementing advanced age-verification and content-filtering systems. Firms like Yoti are using AI to estimate age from facial features, while phone manufacturers such as HMD Global are launching devices with built-in AI to block inappropriate material. This regulatory push is creating a new market for safety tech, though it also raises privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly by revoking their visas. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to actions undermining peace efforts and seeking unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. This move, which Israel welcomed, raises questions about U.S. obligations under the UN Headquarters Agreement to facilitate travel for foreign officials. The Palestinian leadership expressed astonishment, calling the ban a contradiction of international law and urging its reversal.</p>

          <p>Protests in Makassar, Indonesia, escalated tragically when a council building was set on fire, resulting in the deaths of three people trapped inside. The demonstration was sparked by public anger over the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. Demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and rocks, overwhelming the building and setting it ablaze while other protests occurred in the capital, Jakarta. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation into the driver's death and urged for calm amid the growing unrest.</p>

          <p>Following a surprising loss to a lower-league team, scrutiny has intensified on Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim's tactical system. This article provides a deep dive into why his rigid 5-2-3 positional play, which relies on creating numerical overloads, has been largely unsuccessful in the Premier League. Opposing teams have effectively countered his strategy with man-to-man marking, neutralizing United's pre-planned passing routines. The analysis suggests that Amorim's system allows for little individual expression and is vulnerable to teams that can bypass the initial press and exploit the two-man midfield, raising questions about his need to adapt.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration reported that all flights for SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in the U.S., were grounded for a brief period on Friday night. The ground stop, which lasted for 21 minutes, was issued at the airline's own request. The FAA did not provide further details on the reason for the temporary nationwide halt. SkyWest operates flights for major carriers including United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines, so the brief disruption had the potential for widespread impact on the national aviation system.</p>
