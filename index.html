This development is significant given ADNOC's growth and financial strength, and its existing relationship with BP.

          <p>This article explores the complexities of public protest, particularly under authoritarian regimes.  It references Hannah Arendt's work on totalitarianism, highlighting the potential for protests to be used by authoritarian rulers to justify displays of power.  The article contrasts the peaceful Women's Marches of 2017 with the violent suppression of protests in other contexts, arguing that the treatment of protesters often depends on racial and other biases.  The author ultimately argues that while protesting can be risky, it is necessary to oppose injustice.</p>
