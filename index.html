          <p>NFL quarterback Lamar Jackson, also owner of the Maryland Colts horse racing franchise in the National Thoroughbred League, aims to achieve championship success in both football and horse racing. Jackson purchased the Maryland Colts in 2024, locating the team in Baltimore, mirroring the city's Super Bowl-winning NFL team's moniker. He emphasizes meaningful investments with long-term goals, focusing on creating opportunities for Baltimore's youth beyond sports. Jackson's move is part of a trend among NFL quarterbacks seeking equity in sports teams, but he currently has no plans to expand beyond the Colts, instead focusing on creating a positive impact on the city of Baltimore.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is currently debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, marking the first such debate since significant amendments were introduced. The bill, initiated by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, has undergone intense scrutiny and changes, including the removal of the need for High Court approval. MPs are considering amendments to ensure no obligation on medical staff to participate and to prevent doctors from discussing assisted dying with under 18s unless initiated by the patient. The government has published impact reports projecting potential NHS savings, but concerns remain regarding the role of doctors and potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. Broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen has been campaigning for assisted dying after revealing her terminal lung cancer diagnosis last year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's four-day tour of the Middle East concluded with a meeting with business leaders in Abu Dhabi, following visits to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The trip was marked by opulent receptions and announcements of business deals for U.S. companies, with the White House claiming deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Key developments included a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing longstanding U.S. policies, and suggestions of progress in nuclear talks with Iran.

          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are pressuring Duke University to end its partnership with Wuhan University in China, citing concerns about technology transfers and potential student manipulation. They argue that Duke Kunshan University (DKU) creates a direct pathway between U.S. innovation and China's military-industrial complex. DKU, founded in 2013, offers students dual degrees from both Duke and Wuhan University, with opportunities to study at Duke's campus in North Carolina. The lawmakers worry that exchange programs provide Chinese students access to federally funded U.S. research, which could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

This "bonus" is aimed at helping retirees retain more of their income and is presented as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The proposal would provide an additional $4,000 deduction for individuals aged 65 and over, applicable to tax years 2025 through 2028, with a phase-out for higher-income earners. While it would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is less generous than a tax credit, which reduces tax liability dollar for dollar.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations are actively seeking trade talks with the United States amid concerns over potential tariffs. With a 90-day pause on tariffs set to expire in July, countries are eager to engage with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Trump's tariffs, which were initially suspended, have created uncertainty and prompted countries to send high-level delegations to push for meetings with American officials. The APEC meeting provided an opportunity for countries to discuss progress since the start of discussions in early May.</p>

          <p>India's increasing dominance in global cricket, driven by its financial strength and political connections, is raising concerns about the game's diversity and equity. The election of Jay Shah as chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC), while also serving as secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has fueled these concerns. The BCCI's financial power, largely derived from television rights for a market of over 1.4 billion people, allows India to shape tournament schedules and ICC media rights. This influence is evident in its relationship with Pakistan, with bilateral series suspended since 2013 due to political tensions.</p>

          <p>Frank Bruni, Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Nate Silver discuss the public's perception of President Trump's second term in office. Trump's approval ratings experienced a steep decline early in his term, particularly due to the implementation of tariffs that negatively impacted consumer confidence. While his numbers have slightly rebounded, concerns remain about his handling of the economy and trade. Anderson notes that the economy used to be a strong point for Trump, but that is no longer the case. Silver suggests that Trump may have lost voters' confidence in his ability to manage the economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's denunciation of "activist judges" echoes a historical trend of U.S. presidents criticizing the judiciary when disagreeing with their decisions. The term "judicial activism," coined in 1947, describes judges who base rulings on policy views rather than legal interpretation. Presidents from both Democratic and Republican parties have accused courts of exceeding their constitutional role. While the Constitution enshrines an independent judiciary, presidents have often voiced frustration when court rulings obstruct their agendas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's immigration policies are facing challenges in federal courts, particularly regarding expedited deportations of Venezuelan migrants. Federal district judges are questioning the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, arguing that it interferes with the executive branch's authority over foreign relations and national security. The conflict arises from Trump's claim that the Tren de Aragua gang constitutes an invasion by a hostile government. Some legal experts contend that the courts are overstepping their boundaries by questioning the elected branches' decisions on matters of war and national security.</p>

          <p>Despite abortion remaining legal in many states, a growing number of clinics are closing due to financial and operational challenges. Experts suggest that financial and operational hurdles, rather than legal bans, may pose the greatest threat to abortion access in states with protective laws. The closures are attributed to rising costs, limited reimbursement rates, and increased demand for telehealth services. Planned Parenthood of Michigan, for example, is closing four health centers, citing financial sustainability as the reason, which has sparked questions about prioritizing patient care for vulnerable populations.</p>

Clinical psychologist Elsa Lau emphasizes that being in a space where people cheer for you because they see a part of themselves in you can make those feelings more real. Queer organizers recommend narrowing down what you're looking for, whether it's shared hobbies, racial identity, or values. It's also beneficial to trust the process and create your own space if existing options don't feel right, remembering that community can take many forms, both online and offline.</p>
