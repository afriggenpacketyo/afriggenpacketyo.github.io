          <p>President Trump announced a Cabinet shuffle, nominating Michael Waltz as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim national security advisor. The move came after Waltz faced scrutiny for inadvertently including a reporter in a Signal chat discussing a U.S. military strike. Vice President Vance downplayed the Signal incident, suggesting Waltz was better suited for the U.N. role after reforms to the National Security Council. Rubio's appointment was unexpected, with State Department spokesperson Bruce learning of the change during a press briefing. This article highlights the ever-changing landscape of Trump's administration.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify investigated a people smuggler named Fadi Gujjar, documenting his activities across three continents, who promised safe routes to Europe but delivered deadly conditions. Gujjar, from Pakistan, used social media to advertise his services and lured migrants with false promises. Survivors reported paying Gujjar $13,000 for a journey that turned deadly, with over 50 people dying at sea due to starvation, dehydration, and violence from the crew. The investigation highlights the dangerous routes migrants take and the exploitation by smugglers preying on their aspirations for a better life.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Streeting is under fire for altering maternity funding, prompting accusations of 'betrayal' from campaigners. Originally, almost £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety after a report on poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. However, recent changes mean only £2m of the funding is guaranteed for maternity care this year. Critics fear this shift will lead to budget cuts and reverse progress in maternity safety, while the Department of Health argues local leaders will have more flexibility in allocating the funds.</p>

Experts suggest that the administration's tough rhetoric, rapid deportations, and dismantling of Biden-era programs have deterred migrants from attempting to cross the border. This marks a significant shift from the high levels of illegal crossings experienced under the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is changing its policy on sex crime cases after the death of a 13-year-old boy, requiring prosecutors to expedite the filing of felony charges in sexual assault and family violence cases. The policy change follows a report highlighting a backlog of criminal cases in the district attorney's office that may have contributed to delays in charging a suspect in the boy's sexual assault and murder. The new policy mandates that the process to file a criminal complaint must begin within one business day after a decision has been made to seek an arrest warrant.</p>

However, the company anticipates $900 million in additional costs for the upcoming quarter due to tariffs.

The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading, likely due to the tariff news and weaker-than-expected revenue from its services division. Cook stated that China would remain a major manufacturer, but India and Vietnam would increase production of iPhones, iPads, and Macs.</p>

          <p>Australia's upcoming federal election is being heavily influenced by the unpredictable nature of President Trump and his trade policies. Despite candidates' desires to focus on domestic issues, they are forced to grapple with how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump. The Labor Party's Albanese is trying to reassure voters that alliances remain strong, and some analysts suggest Trump's actions may be helping Albanese by causing voters to rally around him during a time of perceived crisis.

The editorial outlines five pillars of democracy that Trump has attacked: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people.

If tariffs persist, small businesses may be forced to pass on the cost to consumers, potentially leading to financial disaster.</p>
