          <p>In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, municipal elections show the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) are projected to win. However, the results are also marked by significant gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is expected to place third. The election is widely viewed as the first major electoral test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The AfD's strong performance, particularly in former industrial areas, could increase pressure on the federal government regarding issues like immigration and internal security.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a visit aimed at managing the diplomatic fallout from Israel's recent assassination attempt on Hamas leaders in Qatar. The strike, which killed aides and a Qatari security officer, has angered key Arab allies and raised concerns in Washington about regional stability. While Rubio publicly reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance, his visit is intended to convey President Trump's displeasure with the attack. The talks also covered Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza City and the expansion of settlements.</p>

Meacham asserts that resorting to violence over political disagreements breaks the American covenant of living in contention without being at each other's throats.

The arrest reports state that the clerks confirmed the substance could be used to get high and, in some cases, explained its effects to the undercover agents before completing the sales.

          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago offers a fresh perspective on the work of Gustave Caillebotte, often considered one of the lesser-known French Impressionist painters. While his peers focused on landscapes and ballerinas, Caillebotte's canvases often centered on men in modern urban life, a perspective unusual for his time. The exhibition, titled "Painting His World," showcases famous works like "Paris Street; Rainy Day" alongside more controversial pieces, such as "The Floor Scrapers," which was once rejected by the art establishment. The show aims to re-integrate Caillebotte into the broader narrative of Impressionism and invites new interpretations of his art.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's new law making tips tax-deductible, while seemingly beneficial for workers, ultimately reinforces America's problematic tipping culture. The author contends that instead of relying on the obligation and variability of tips, employers should be pressured to pay their staff a fair, living wage. The piece critiques the temporary nature of the tax benefit and questions the eligibility of certain professions, such as digital content creators and event planners, while noting others like teachers and postal workers were excluded. The author concludes that the focus should be on systemic wage reform rather than incentivizing tipping.</p>

The ADL noted that several other recent school shooters have also frequented the same site, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization in these spaces. The shooter, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot, had posted images of another mass shooter and tactical gear with extremist symbols on his social media accounts prior to the attack. The findings highlight the role of certain online platforms in glorifying violence.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The AI model synthesizes content from the product catalog, user comments, and other web sources to create the audio clips, which are now available on over a million products in the U.S. mobile app. While the feature aims to make shopping easier and more accessible, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific details found in human reviews. Critics worry it could flatten context and unintentionally blend marketing language with genuine user feedback.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Condemning Charlie Kirk's Murder Should Not Require Rewriting His Divisive Legacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 09:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that while the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is a tragedy that should be unequivocally condemned, it is a mistake to retroactively sanitize his life's work. The author criticizes commentators who have praised Kirk's campus events as good-faith political debate, asserting they were instead trolling affairs designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric. The article contends that an honest accounting of Kirk's career, which included opposing the Civil Rights Act and promoting the "great replacement theory," is necessary. True commitment to nonviolence and equality, the author suggests, requires acknowledging this history rather than ignoring it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an analysis of the ongoing Gaza war, arguing that Israeli society is adapting to a state of permanent conflict, which has become the new normal. The piece suggests that the suffering of Palestinians remains distant and abstract for many Israelis, with media focusing on other topics and the military adjusting its reservist practices for long-term operations. The author observes a shift in public discourse away from political solutions and toward a mythical, victim-centric narrative that frames the conflict as an eternal, biblical struggle. This mindset, combined with international dynamics, has created a sense of a permanent present with no clear vision for a future resolution.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids has created a climate of fear and apprehension across immigrant communities in Los Angeles. The decision overturned a temporary restraining order that had barred agents from racially profiling people, and the Department of Homeland Security has vowed to increase its enforcement actions. This has left many undocumented workers, such as day laborers, facing an impossible choice between risking deportation by going to work or staying home and facing eviction for unpaid rent. In response, volunteer groups are mobilizing to monitor raid activity and inform residents of their rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new report on children's health, titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," is facing criticism from health advocates and parents for its failure to mention nicotine or smoking. The 20-page document, which outlines a strategy to combat chronic childhood diseases, does not address the risks associated with tobacco use or vaping, a significant concern for many. Critics point out that this contrasts with President Trump's focus on youth vaping during his first term and runs counter to recent actions that have dismantled federal tobacco control programs. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.</p>

          <p>In preparation for the hostile environment expected at the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York, the European team is using a novel training method: virtual reality headsets that shout abuse. According to Rory McIlroy, Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to help players desensitize themselves to the sights, sounds, and potential name-calling from the American crowd. McIlroy revealed that players could customize the verbal abuse to be as harsh as they wanted, calling it an effort to be as prepared as possible. Europe has not secured a Ryder Cup victory on American soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>As the WNBA postseason begins, sports analysts are offering their predictions for the championship race. Many experts are pointing to the Minnesota Lynx as the team to beat, with some suggesting they are on a "revenge tour" after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals. Led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier, the Lynx possess the league's top defense and strong veteran leadership. Other top contenders include the Las Vegas Aces, who ended the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, and the defending champion New York Liberty, though their chances may hinge on returning key players from injury.</p>

In an interview, Giuffre's brother stated that every person, regardless of their status, deserves to be held to the fullest extent of the law. Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that the prince abused her on three occasions when she was 17. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>Ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, the Commons Business and Trade Committee is urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to maximize pressure on the U.S. to finalize a deal on steel tariffs. While a trade agreement signed in June reduced tariffs on some UK goods, it left a 25% tariff on British steel in place. The committee's report emphasizes that the high-profile visit is a critical opportunity to secure a lasting agreement that would end the threat of future tariffs. The visit marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, an unprecedented gesture for a U.S. president.</p>
