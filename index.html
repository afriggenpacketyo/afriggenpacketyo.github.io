Zelensky emphasized the need for a full ceasefire before any talks can commence, highlighting that prolonging the conflict serves no purpose. He hopes Russia will agree to a ceasefire starting tomorrow to provide a basis for diplomacy. The offer follows interventions from Western powers and Trump's social media posts advocating for immediate discussions to assess the possibility of reaching a deal.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported "substantial progress" in trade talks with China, indicating a potential de-escalation of the trade war. The talks, held in Geneva, are the first since President Trump levied steep tariffs against China. Details of the agreement are expected to be announced soon, with Trump praising the talks for engendering a "total reset" in the relationship between the two countries. The US has insisted that China must make its own concessions to lower tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky is pushing for an immediate truce, while President Trump questioned whether Russia's leader wants to make a deal but urged both sides to meet this week in Turkey for talks.

Leaders of France, Britain, Germany and Poland set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions.</p>

The article suggests that unless King Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could negatively impact his reign.

          <p>The US and Iran have held a fourth round of talks over Tehran's nuclear programme in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said they were "difficult but useful". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim. The talks are aimed at reviving a previous nuclear agreement.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch, intended to subvert stereotypes about middle-aged mothers, fell short by reinforcing the idea that they are undesirable and lack sexual agency. The sketch featured a server aggressively flirting with mothers, and the joke relied on the perceived ridiculousness of anyone finding them attractive. Instead of challenging societal views, the sketch ultimately reinforced the notion that mothers are sexless and unappealing. The review states that the show had an opportunity to push back against the stereotype that middle-aged women are both undesirable and empty of desire themselves.</p>

The harrowing four-day conflict, and so many of the underlying accelerants remain volatile, that there’s little to suggest that the truce represents any return to old patterns of restraint. The new generation of military technology fueled a dizzying aerial escalation. The political realities in India and Pakistan — each gripped by an entrenched religious nationalism — remain unchanged after the fighting.</p>
