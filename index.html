        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and is actively preparing to use military force to alter Asia's balance of power, possibly by 2027. Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war, emphasizing that the US does not seek to dominate China but will not allow allies to be intimidated. In response, the Chinese embassy accused the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea and reconnaissance of Chinese islands. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, suggesting Beijing would use them for leverage. The optimism score reflects the potential for conflict and the need for vigilance.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest ceasefire proposal submitted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to mediators, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid.

Israeli forces have reportedly killed at least 60 Palestinians and injured 284 in Gaza over the past 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction, as the IDF continues operations in Gaza.

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients are being denied hip and knee replacements by a third of NHS areas in England and multiple health boards in Wales based on their body mass index (BMI), despite NICE guidelines stating BMI shouldn't restrict access to surgery. Patients are told to lose weight before being eligible, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are extensive. The Royal College of Surgeons criticized the policy, while former health minister James Bethell called for government action to address the obesity crisis.

          <p>Vox reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental toxins as the cause, which has been met with criticism from many autism scientists. Experts argue that the increase in autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions, awareness, and screening, and that genetics are the most important driver. Scientists fear Kennedy's focus on toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies.

          <p>The BBC reports that a military aircraft and helicopters are being used to evacuate residents in Manitoba, Canada, from fast-moving wildfires. Thousands have already evacuated western Canada, particularly the central prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Dense smoke from the fires has spread across Canada and into parts of the US, and both Saskatchewan and Manitoba have declared states of emergency. The evacuation of residents of the northern First Nations community of Pukatawagan is a "rapidly evolving situation."

          <p>Laura Kuenssberg of the BBC discusses the upcoming strategic defence review, which will address the UK's military capabilities in a "new, dangerous era." The review is expected to emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, NATO, and modernizing the armed forces, and stress a greater need for public participation in protecting the country. While some sources claim it will be "transformative," others downplay its likely impact, suggesting that substantive changes may be limited. The review also faces financial and political challenges, including balancing defence spending with other priorities. The optimism score reflects the need for adaptation and the potential limitations of the review.</p>
