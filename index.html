          <p>The Trump administration eased its ban on senior American diplomats attending events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, after facing criticism. The U.S. Consul General attended a reception in Ho Chi Minh City, but the U.S. ambassador was not present. Critics argue that the administration's initial ban demonstrated a lack of understanding about the importance of postwar reconciliation, especially given the current strategic partnership between the U.S. and Vietnam in countering China's influence.</p>

          <p>The Vietnam War, ending 50 years ago, significantly changed perceptions of war, particularly regarding long-term psychological and social consequences. The war led to recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its impact on soldiers, though this was not openly discussed in Vietnam due to political constraints. Overcoming trauma requires societal engagement, including rituals of remembrance, popular narratives, reconciliation, and recognition of atrocities. In Vietnam, the Communist Party dictates the narrative, celebrating victory while cautiously acknowledging the suffering of South Vietnamese soldiers.</p>

While the EU has diversified its energy sources, including dealing with politically unstable countries, sanctions and geopolitical factors prevent trade with Iran. The European bloc is bound by its own sanctions and US-led restrictions, which deter investment in Iran's energy infrastructure. The 2015 nuclear agreement offered a potential pathway, but the US withdrawal in 2018 reversed progress.</p>
