          <p>British oil giant Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations despite a decline from the previous year. The company announced another $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. Shell CEO Wael Sawan hailed the earnings as "another solid set of results," reaffirming the company's commitment to increasing shareholder returns and reducing its annual investment budget to $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025. This announcement follows a trend among Big Oil companies focusing on shareholder returns amidst fluctuating crude prices and evolving trade policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in the Southern District of Texas has permanently prohibited the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration's use of the 18th-century wartime law was illegal, arguing that the president's claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù The ruling, which applies only to Venezuelan immigrants in the Southern District of Texas, is a philosophical rejection of transposing the Alien Enemies Act into modern-day immigration policy and could influence similar cases. The ACLU praised the decision, emphasizing that the president cannot invoke wartime authority during peacetime.</p>

          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers experienced a combined 11.8% increase in U.S. sales in April, driven by customers rushing to purchase vehicles before anticipated price increases due to new tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump implemented a 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States, impacting companies like Subaru and Mazda that export a significant portion of their vehicles from Japan. While this last-minute buying boosted sales, the auto market outlook remains uncertain as future demand may be affected. Hybrid and sport-utility vehicles were particularly popular among buyers.</p>

This move comes as U.S. import taxes could add approximately $900 million to Apple's costs, despite some electronics being exempted from tariffs.
