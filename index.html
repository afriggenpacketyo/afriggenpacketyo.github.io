          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April fell to 2.3%, the lowest since February 2021, slightly below expectations. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, with core CPI also increasing by 0.2%. Shelter prices were identified as the main driver of inflation. The article notes that the lower-than-expected inflation comes as President Trump's tariffs begin to affect the slowing U.S. economy. Markets showed little reaction to the news, with stock futures remaining flat and Treasury yields mixed. (not investment advice)</p>

Roberts acknowledged the strong disagreements among justices but stressed the importance of maintaining decorum and positive working relationships to effectively function as a court. He noted that personal relationships should transcend professional disagreements, even in the face of frustrating habits. His comments come as the Supreme Court is preparing to hear several high-profile cases filed by the Trump administration, including those on education, religious liberty, and election redistricting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge, Laura Taylor Swain, has ordered that an outside official be appointed to oversee New York City's Rikers Island jail complex, removing it from the city's control. This decision comes after nearly a decade of federal oversight due to persistent violence and dysfunction within the jail system. The appointed official, a remediation manager, will report directly to the judge and will be empowered to implement necessary changes. The city's jail population has increased, and conditions have not improved, leading to this intervention as a last resort. New York City has spent more than $500,000 per inmate annually in recent years, yet detainees still sometimes go without food or proper medical care.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with key components of their bill to fund President Trump’s agenda, including taxes and Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee are expected to debate and vote on their proposals. The plan includes imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy has expressed opposition to the proposals.</p>

They find themselves in a tricky position, feeling compelled to participate in the market despite a lack of conviction about the economy's direction. Analysts suggest that the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits may take months to appear in economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State leaders are expressing concern about potential budgetary fallout from President Trump's economic agenda, as the administration considers cutting federal aid to states. Governors worry about the impact of reduced funding on public services like infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Republicans argue that states should shoulder more of the financial burden, but state officials warn they may not be able to absorb the cuts. The Trump administration has proposed scaling back federal aid on programs ranging from public education to mental health, shifting more responsibility to local governments.</p>

Abrego Garcia's attorneys argue there is no reason for invoking the privilege and claim the administration is hiding governmental blunders.

Democrats and some Republicans have criticized the idea, citing legal and security issues.

The fact that this proposed gift comes at the heels of the Trump Organization striking a deal to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar should also raise eyebrows.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of large tariffs, inflation slowed in April, leading to questions about the expected economic crisis. The primary explanation is that US companies stocked up on foreign goods earlier in the year, but prices are expected to rise as inventories are exhausted. While Trump's deal with China has reduced the risk of a severe economic crisis, tariffs are still poised to raise prices and slow growth. The big question is whether tariffs will induce a one-time surge in prices or trigger an inflationary cycle.</p>
