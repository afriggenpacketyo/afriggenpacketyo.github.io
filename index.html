          <p>Penn State has fired head football coach James Franklin following a disappointing 3-3 start to the season, culminating in a home loss to Northwestern and the injury of quarterback Drew Allar. The decision comes less than a year after the team reached the College Football Playoff semifinals, despite Franklin being owed nearly $50 million. Terry Smith will serve as interim head coach as the team's national title aspirations have now evaporated by early October.</p>

Vance accused Democrats of 'hostage-taking' by linking government funding to the ACA credits, as mass layoffs of federal workers began amidst the stalemate.</p>

Sanchez faces felony battery charges stemming from a dispute over a parking situation, where he allegedly fought a 69-year-old truck driver who claimed self-defense. Sanchez, who thanked first responders and his surgeon, is now focused on recovery and spending time with his family, with a pretrial conference scheduled for November 5.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated the Trump administration will 'litigate this as much as we can' after a federal appeals court again blocked the deployment of federalized National Guard members in Chicago. The administration claims federal forces are necessary to control crime, while Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and other city leaders accuse Trump of overstepping authority. This legal battle continues as Chicago hosts its marathon, with ongoing concerns about federal immigration enforcement efforts in the area.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's international affairs advisor, Caroline Glick, expressed 'deep faith' in President Donald Trump's Gaza peace agreement framework. She stated that Trump's plan provides Israel with the means to dismantle Hamas and prevent future threats, particularly through Phase Two's demobilization and deradicalization efforts. The plan outlines an International Stabilization Force operating with the IDF and a temporary technocratic administration for Gaza, overseen by a 'Board of Peace' chaired by Trump.</p>

          <p>The trial of German national Maja T., accused of attacking suspected right-wing extremists in Budapest, highlights ongoing concerns about Hungary's rule of law. Germany's Constitutional Court questioned the fairness of the trial and detention conditions, especially for a non-binary individual. The European Parliament recently rejected Hungary's request to lift immunity for Italian MEP Ilaria Salis, accused in the same incident, citing political motivation. This decision underscores international skepticism towards Hungary's legal system, particularly after Prime Minister Viktor Orban labeled Antifa a terrorist organization.</p>
