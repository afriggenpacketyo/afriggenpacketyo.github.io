            <p>David Hogg, DNC Vice Chair, donated $100,000 to the DCCC after announcing plans to challenge 'ineffective' Democrats, igniting internal party conflict. Hogg aims to replace complacent incumbents, predicting some will strengthen while others will be exposed. Veteran strategist James Carville criticized Hogg's plan as 'insane,' questioning his fiduciary duty to the party. Hogg maintains his commitment to winning back the House and making Hakeem Jeffries the Speaker while simultaneously pushing for a better Democratic Party.</p>

Verstappen led the race until the penalty, after which Piastri took the lead and secured his third win of the season.

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García from El Salvador. She suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for Ábrego García's deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. Klobuchar's comments followed Justice Samuel Alito's dissenting opinion on the Supreme Court's decision to block deportations of Venezuelans, accusing the court of acting hastily and without sufficient explanation.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry found "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, including an operational misunderstanding and a breach of orders. The IDF stated its troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces, claiming six of the casualties were Hamas members. A deputy commander was dismissed for providing an incomplete report, and another officer will receive a reprimand. The Palestine Red Crescent Society dismissed the report as invalid, arguing it shifted responsibility to personal error.</p>
