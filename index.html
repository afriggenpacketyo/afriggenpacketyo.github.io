          <p>The prospect of a renewed trade war between the United States and China is jeopardizing the significant rally seen in Chinese stocks this year. Following President Trump's announcement of substantial new tariffs and export controls, Chinese stocks listed in the US experienced a sharp decline. This escalation in trade tensions, which includes China's own curbs on rare earth exports, introduces significant uncertainty for investors and could halt the momentum that has seen major tech firms like Alibaba and Tencent surge. The situation has created a palpable sense of caution among market analysts, who anticipate immediate pressure on China's markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man was apprehended by security at St. Peter's Basilica after he urinated on the main Altar of the Confession in front of numerous visitors. The incident, captured in videos that circulated online, prompted a quick response from Vatican and Italian authorities, who detained the individual. A Vatican spokesman later stated that the man suffered from a serious mental disability and was handed over to Italian authorities. This event is the latest in a series of disturbances at the historic church, which, according to Canon Law, requires a penitential rite to restore its sanctity after such a desecration.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has sealed its major border crossings at Torkham and Chaman after intense overnight firefights with Afghan forces. Both sides have reported inflicting heavy casualties, with Pakistan claiming to have captured multiple Afghan border posts and the Taliban government in Afghanistan stating they killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers. The conflict erupted after the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which Islamabad accuses Kabul of harboring, claimed responsibility for attacks that killed numerous Pakistani security personnel. Pakistani officials have condemned the Afghan actions as a violation of international law and warned of a strong response to any further provocations.</p>

          <p>China is undertaking one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse extreme terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost, with an average elevation over 4,500 meters. The total investment is estimated to reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. This mega-project highlights Beijing's focus on integrating its remote western regions through ambitious engineering feats, despite the immense financial and logistical hurdles involved.</p>

The attack occurs amid recent reports highlighting a marked increase in violence at the prison, particularly against inmates convicted of sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an "attempt to seize power illegally and by force" is underway in the country. The warning comes as a faction of elite soldiers left their barracks to join thousands of anti-government protesters in the capital, Antananarivo, urging other security forces not to fire on citizens. The protests, initially sparked by anger over power and water shortages, have escalated into broader demands for political change, resulting in numerous deaths. This development marks a significant crisis for Rajoelina, who himself first came to power with military backing in 2009, in a nation with a history of political instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% on steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move aimed at tackling global overproduction and protecting its domestic industry. This decision follows similar protectionist measures enacted by the US, and it is seen by some analysts as a strategic effort to gain leverage and encourage the Trump administration to negotiate concessions on its own steel tariffs. While the European Steel Association welcomed the policy as a "lifeline," China criticized it as a "protectionism step." The new tariff-rate quota system is designed to allow a fair volume of imports while penalizing excessive levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is phasing in its new digital border control system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will affect non-EU citizens, including travelers from the UK. The system replaces traditional passport stamping with a digital record, requiring travelers to register biometric data, such as fingerprints and a facial image, on their first entry. This registration, valid for three years, is being introduced at various border points, including airports and Channel crossings like Dover and the Eurotunnel. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns have been raised about potential delays during the initial implementation phase.</p>

However, party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth clarified that this step would not be taken within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government, suggesting a longer-term strategy. The party endorsed a proposal to create a "standing commission" to engage the public on Wales's constitutional future and build on the work of a previous government commission. This move represents a more gradual approach compared to their 2021 pledge of holding a referendum within five years, positioning the party as a government-in-waiting focused on a phased journey toward independence.</p>

While some media outlets misleadingly framed it as "extra holidays," the policy merely clarifies an existing legal practice rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom. The regulation extends a principle already applied to other religious minorities, such as Catholics in predominantly Protestant states, allowing them to observe significant holy days. The episode highlights the ongoing national conversation in Germany regarding integration, religious equality, and the evolving nature of public holidays in a diverse society.</p>

Their study, published in the journal Cell, reveals that flipping two specific genetic switches can initiate this process, known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability, previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized egg cells, allows differentiated cells to revert to an embryonic state and develop into a complete organism. The discovery provides fundamental insights into one of biology's most profound processes and could have significant implications for plant science and agriculture.</p>

Despite holding the all-time goalscoring records for both the England national team and Tottenham Hotspur, and continuing his success at Bayern Munich, some criticism persists. Pundits argue that Kane's consistent, decade-long brilliance and his well-rounded abilities as both a scorer and a playmaker place him among the world's elite players. His understated, humble personality is suggested as one reason he might not receive the same level of acclaim as other superstars, though his value to his teams is considered immense and irreplaceable.</p>

          <p>A large rally in Tel Aviv expressed cautious optimism ahead of the expected release of Israeli hostages by Hamas, with speakers crediting former U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in brokering the deal. The agreement, which is set to be finalized at a summit in Egypt, would see the return of 48 hostages held for two years. While many in the crowd thanked Trump, there was also audible anger directed at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the failures that led to the conflict. As Israel awaits the return of the hostages, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to the ruins of northern Gaza following the withdrawal of Israeli troops.</p>

          <h2>Kenya Converts Chinese Railway Loans from US Dollars to Yuan to Reduce Debt Costs</h2>

          <p>Kenya has announced it is converting US$5 billion in loans from China, used to finance its Standard Gauge Railway, from US dollars into Chinese yuan. This currency swap is expected to save the country approximately US$215 million in annual debt-servicing costs, providing significant financial relief. The original dollar-denominated loans from the Export-Import Bank of China carried higher interest rates, which the new yuan-based terms are expected to halve. Analysts suggest this move could set a precedent for other debt-distressed African nations and may serve to strengthen their economic ties with Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent revelations of an email suggesting Prince Andrew maintained ties with Jeffrey Epstein longer than he claimed have intensified pressure on the British Royal Family. This article analyzes the potential actions King Charles can take to distance the monarchy from the ongoing scandals surrounding his brother. While Andrew has already been stripped of his HRH title and royal duties, options like removing his Duke of York title would require an act of Parliament. Evicting him from his Royal Lodge residence is also complicated by a long-term private lease. The Palace has preferred subtle methods of exclusion, but the relentless negative headlines pose a significant and persistent challenge to the King's reign.</p>
