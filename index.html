          <p>New thunderstorms and a high risk of flash flooding have forced emergency crews to suspend search operations in Kerr County, Texas. The area is still reeling from the catastrophic July 4 floods along the Guadalupe River, which left at least 132 people dead and over 160 missing statewide. Authorities are monitoring rising water levels and have issued new evacuation orders, warning that the situation remains dangerous and life-threatening. This renewed threat complicates the massive, ongoing recovery effort to find victims from the initial disaster.</p>

          <p>An independent inquiry has upheld 45 of 83 allegations against "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace, spanning a 19-year period. The substantiated claims include unwelcome physical contact, being undressed, inappropriate sexual language, and culturally insensitive comments. The report notes Wallace's recent autism diagnosis but states he does not wish to hide behind it. In response to the findings, the BBC has confirmed it has no plans to work with Wallace in the future and apologized for missed opportunities to address the behavior sooner.</p>

          <p>As part of its annual Han Kuang military exercises, Taiwan's navy conducted a live-streamed drill demonstrating its mine-laying capabilities off the coast of Kaohsiung. The exercise, aimed at bolstering readiness against a potential invasion, featured fast minelaying boats deploying Taiwanese-made naval mines. Simultaneously, military police practiced urban warfare tactics by using the Taipei metro system for a pre-dawn troop and supply redeployment under simulated air strikes. These drills highlight Taiwan's focus on asymmetric warfare strategies to deter potential aggression.</p>

An FAQ page on the Fed's website addresses claims made by officials, such as OMB Director Russell Vought, who criticized the project's cost overruns and alleged extravagances. The Fed clarifies that taxpayers do not fund the project and attributes cost increases to unforeseen issues like asbestos and design changes. This public pushback represents a rare move by the central bank to counter political pressure from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that restrictive zoning and land-use laws function like a cartel, allowing wealthy landowners to hoard wealth by artificially limiting housing supply and driving up prices. Therefore, the YIMBY goal of deregulation is not anti-regulation in general, but a targeted attack on rules that have been captured by a powerful elite.

          <p>A military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving the lives of dozens of soldiers and civilians. While on patrol in the Antioquia region, Sanson detected a bomb planted by ELN guerrilla fighters, which then detonated. The explosion shattered one of the dog's legs, which later had to be amputated, but his detection prevented a larger tragedy. The Colombian army stated that while Sanson can no longer serve, his legacy will live on in the soldiers he protected.</p>

          <p>Trade ministers from across the European Union are meeting in Brussels to strategize after U.S. President Donald Trump announced potential 30% tariffs on EU goods. The surprise move has created uncertainty for the world's largest trading bloc, which is America's biggest business partner. While some leaders are calling for caution and a negotiated deal, others are urging the preparation of strong retaliatory measures. The EU has suspended its own planned countermeasures as a gesture of goodwill, hoping to reach a resolution before the August 1 deadline set by the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving the use of restraints in the federal prison system. The investigation found that Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials violated their own rules, shackling inmates for extended periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report details several disturbing cases, including one death following prolonged restraint, and criticizes the BOP for inadequate record-keeping. In response, the BOP has agreed to revise its policies and practices to prevent such abuses.</p>

For two days after the murder, he used her phone to pretend to her family that she was still alive. The judge described the crime as robbing the victim of her life in the cruelest way and her family of the comfort of saying goodbye.</p>

The home, run by Catholic nuns from 1925 to 1961, housed unwed mothers and their children. Previous test digs found "significant quantities" of remains in a disused septic tank. The two-year forensic investigation aims to exhume, analyze, and, if possible, identify the remains to provide a proper burial for children who were denied dignity in life and death.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for free, universal childcare has resonated with voters and become a key plank of his affordability-focused platform. The plan, which would be funded by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, responds to a surge in activism around the city's childcare crisis, where annual costs can exceed $26,000. Advocates say the policy would provide financial relief, improve gender equity in the workforce, and bolster the city's economy. The success of the proposal in the primary suggests that making childcare a public good has become a winning political issue.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas's Hill Country bears a striking resemblance to a deadly 1987 flood in the same area that killed 10 children from a church camp. Survivors and observers of the 1987 disaster see it as a tragic foreshadowing, questioning why more robust warning systems were not implemented in the intervening decades. While the nearby town of Comfort, which was at the center of the 1987 tragedy, recently installed a siren system that helped evacuate residents this time, Kerr County's plans for a similar system stalled.

While Google implemented additional protections after being notified, the findings raise serious concerns about the safety of AI products being rolled out for children.

          <p>In a personal essay, an Israeli theater director and pacifist reflects on his feelings of alienation since the start of the Gaza war. He describes being ostracized within Israel for opposing the war and being rejected abroad for his Israeli identity, regardless of his long-standing activism against the occupation. The author recounts painful encounters with both family members who question his loyalty and international colleagues who label him a "killer." He concludes that in a world demanding absolute allegiance, there is little space for the nuanced position of advocating for the rights of both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

          <p>Despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control that should enable better sleep, many Americans still suffer from insomnia and sleep deprivation. This article explores the paradox, attributing the problem to a mix of modern lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and systemic issues. Revenge bedtime procrastination, constant screen use, and stress disrupt sleep, while an obsession with "perfecting" sleep can ironically worsen insomnia. Furthermore, factors like noise pollution, housing insecurity, and the stress of discrimination create significant barriers to rest, particularly for lower-income and minority populations.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price inflation fell to 2.1% in June, a rate lower than economists had expected and an extension of a more than six-year low. This marks the eighth consecutive month of decline, driven primarily by a continued drop in food prices, which registered at -1.06%. The cooling inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its monetary easing policy to stimulate the economy. Strong crop production and a good monsoon season are expected to keep food inflation low, boosting consumer purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European and Asian stock markets had a mixed and relatively subdued reaction to President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico. The announcement created new uncertainty in global trade, but investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach as negotiations continue. The EU has delayed its own retaliatory tariffs in hopes of reaching a deal before the August 1 deadline. Analysts suggest the market response is muted due to the ongoing nature of the talks, making it difficult to price in the ultimate outcome of the tariff threats. (not investment advice)</p>
