          <p>A shooting incident at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and two injuries. The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Authorities have arrested a 23-year-old suspect, Hunter Nadeau, and charged him with second-degree murder, stating there is no known connection between him and the victims. The event occurred during a wedding reception, where a witness reported the shooter was subdued after being struck with a chair before being apprehended by police.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested from its highly profitable investment in the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD. The initial $230 million investment, made in 2008 at the strong recommendation of Charlie Munger, had grown substantially over 17 years. While Buffett praised BYD as an "extraordinary company," the decision to sell aligns with recent moves to reduce exposure to geopolitical risks associated with China, similar to the sale of its Taiwan Semiconductor stake. The company indicated it would find other investments for the capital.</p>

          <p>John Stapleton, a distinguished British television presenter known for his work on programs like the BBC's "Watchdog" and ITV's "GMTV," has passed away at the age of 79. His agent confirmed he died peacefully in the hospital from pneumonia, which complicated his existing Parkinson's disease. Stapleton's extensive career began in local newspapers before he moved into television, where he became a prominent figure in current affairs and consumer advocacy journalism. Colleagues remembered him as a versatile and brilliant broadcaster and a genuinely kind person.</p>

          <p>In response to inconsistencies and fracturing recommendations from national health agencies, several U.S. states are forming regional collaboratives to strengthen public health policies. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative, comprising seven states and New York City, aims to coordinate on issues like emergency preparedness and vaccine purchasing. This trend mirrors the West Coast Health Alliance and reflects a growing state-level effort to create reliable health guidance, particularly concerning vaccinations, as federal policies become more variable and politically influenced, creating a patchwork of regulations across the country.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: True Resilience Comes from Mastering Emotions, Not Suppressing Them</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 08:00:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that genuine strength and grit are not defined by the absence of emotion but by the ability to understand and manage one's feelings effectively. Citing psychological research, the author posits that suppressing emotions like anger and fear leads to brittleness, whereas acknowledging them allows for greater self-control and perseverance. The piece suggests that emotional mastery is a critical skill for navigating life's challenges, fueling personal and professional success. It concludes that true toughness is about harnessing emotions strategically rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a significant trilateral military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without deploying an aircraft carrier. This departure from standard practice has prompted speculation among analysts about its strategic implications for relations with China. Some experts suggest the move could be a deliberate de-escalation to facilitate diplomatic engagement with Beijing and Pyongyang. Others interpret it as a signal of the Trump administration's strategy to encourage Asian allies to take on more responsibility for regional security.</p>

          <p>Medical experts and individuals are calling for sex education in schools to include comprehensive information about fertility, not just pregnancy prevention. Many people, particularly women, reach adulthood with significant misconceptions about their reproductive biology, such as the timeline of fertility decline and factors affecting conception. This knowledge gap can lead to difficulties in family planning later in life. Proponents argue that a more robust curriculum could empower young people with the information needed to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, potentially helping them achieve their desired family size in the future.</p>

Kasparov and Applebaum argue that institutions are failing to resist these pressures, warning that the 2026 midterm elections will be a critical battleground for the future of U.S. democracy.</p>

The author warns that this "breathless embrace" of Silicon Valley giants comes without sufficient public debate on the environmental costs, the social impact of AI, and the risks of dependency on a few powerful American corporations.</p>

          <p>An executive order signed by President Donald Trump introducing a new $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas caused widespread confusion and panic, prompting some visa holders to spend thousands of dollars to return to the U.S. before the rule took effect. One software professional cut short a family trip to India and spent over $8,000 on last-minute flights fearing he would be locked out. The White House later clarified that the one-time fee would only apply to new applicants, not current visa holders, but the initial ambiguity created a traumatic and costly scramble for many.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of check-in and baggage systems, has caused continued disruption at several key European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's MUSE software forced airlines to revert to manual check-in processes, leading to significant delays and flight cancellations. Collins' parent company, RTX, confirmed the "cyber-related disruption" but stated its impact was limited. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to supply chain cyberattacks, where compromising a single vendor can have widespread, cross-border consequences.</p>

Russian media reported that Lapin, who previously commanded the Central Military District, will now serve as an aide in the Tatarstan region, focusing on veterans' affairs. In 2022, Lapin faced sharp criticism from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian town of Lyman.

          <p>Despite the struggles of the mainstream box office and the dominance of streaming, repertory cinemas in Los Angeles are experiencing a resurgence. Theaters like Vidiots, the New Beverly, and those run by American Cinematheque are drawing sold-out crowds by offering unique, curated communal experiences, such as screenings of rare 35mm prints and events with filmmakers. These independent venues have cultivated a niche audience of cinephiles who seek more than just passive viewing. Their success suggests a strong public desire for shared cultural events and a deeper engagement with the art of film that streaming platforms cannot replicate.</p>

Citing recent studies from MIT and other institutions, the author asserts that relying on AI for tasks like writing leads to "cognitive offloading," which weakens critical thinking and reduces brain connectivity. The author compares this technological dependency to using an e-bike instead of a traditional one, suggesting that while it offers ease, it ultimately atrophies our mental and physical capabilities.

Local business owners and workers fear the economic impact of losing the show's daily audience, while free speech advocates and labor unions decry the political pressure from the FCC and the Trump administration that led to the suspension, calling it a threat to both creative expression and jobs.</p>

While largely symbolic, the move is intended to increase pressure for a two-state solution and keep the prospect of peace alive.

Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the commentary calls for empathy to become a public practice to counteract the culture of grievance.

Doumbouya, who took power in a 2021 coup, has overseen the drafting of a new constitution that extends presidential terms and makes it harder for political parties to compete. The country's main opposition leaders have called for a boycott of the vote, and the UN has raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of the process amid a crackdown on political dissent.
