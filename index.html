The organization now includes 40% of the world's population and has a combined GDP of around $24 trillion, with stronger growth momentum than the G7 economies. With new members like Iran joining and others like Turkey expressing interest, the SCO is evolving into a key platform for a multipolar world, prompting a strategic response from the United States.</p>

Kennedy Jr., while also critiquing the Vice President's use of profanity. In a statement, Graham agreed with the substance of Vance's point about a "corrupt system" but suggested a better choice of words was needed. The situation arose after Vance posted on X that senators questioning Kennedy were "full of s---," a message Kennedy himself endorsed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will host the 2026 Group of 20 (G20) summit at his Trump National Doral resort in Florida. The decision revives a plan from his first term that was abandoned due to ethical concerns over potential conflicts of interest. The White House stated the resort would host the event "at-cost" with no profit, and the summit's agenda will focus on economic prosperity through deregulation and new technologies. The G20 represents the world's largest economies, accounting for about 85% of global GDP.</p>

          <p>At the Reform UK conference in Birmingham, leader Nigel Farage delivered a speech capitalizing on the concurrent Labour government's cabinet reshuffle, declaring the government is "deep in crisis" and unfit to govern. Farage's address was moved up to react to the breaking news of Angela Rayner's resignation, which triggered the reshuffle. He positioned Reform as the "party on the rise" and suggested a general election could come as early as 2027, urging the party to prepare for all eventualities.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has agreed to a landmark settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors, committing to pay at least $1.5 billion for allegedly using their books to train its AI models without permission.

As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and destroy the datasets in question.

          <p>China's biotechnology industry has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade, shifting from a focus on generic drugs to fostering genuine innovation.

This has led to a considerable increase in the quality and reliability of clinical data from China, positioning the country as a growing competitor to the United States in the biotech space, even amidst potential tariff challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is systematically dismantling U.S.-backed international broadcasting and anti-propaganda initiatives, effectively surrendering in the global information war against autocratic regimes like China and Russia. This article details how the administration, under adviser Kari Lake, is defunding and attacking institutions like Voice of America and the Global Engagement Center. These actions are seen as a unilateral disarmament that allows authoritarian narratives to fill the void, harming U.S. national security and abandoning the long-standing bipartisan consensus on promoting free access to information worldwide.</p>

          <h2>Relatives of Official Who Accused Fed Governor of Housing Fraud Found to Have Similar Property Claims</h2>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that close relatives of Bill Pulte, the FHFA director who accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of housing fraud, have themselves claimed primary residence tax exemptions on two different properties in Michigan and Florida. Pulte's father and stepmother have maintained "homestead exemptions" in both states, a practice generally not permitted. After being contacted by Reuters, tax officials in Michigan revoked the exemption on the Pulte family's property there. The revelation introduces a layer of hypocrisy to Pulte's public accusations against Cook, whom President Trump fired based on the allegations.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Finds Chicago's Violent Crime Rate Lower Than Other Major U.S. Cities Despite Trump's Claims</h2>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of FBI data challenges President Trump's characterization of Chicago as a "hell hole" and "murder capital." While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides last year, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large U.S. cities. Furthermore, the city's overall violent crime rate was lower than that of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., and has been falling. The analysis notes that while perceptions of crime can be influenced by high-profile incidents, the statistical reality is more complex than political rhetoric suggests.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her pointed written response to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case concerning nationwide injunctions. Barrett explained that Jackson had made a "spirited argument" in her solo dissent, which she felt "merited a spirited response." She emphasized that the exchange was about the legal merits of the case and not a personal attack, stating she has "great respect" for Justice Jackson. Barrett stressed that vigorous debate on the page does not prevent the justices from maintaining collegial and friendly relationships off the court.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is pausing its mandate that would have required 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026, citing the impact of U.S. trade policies and a weakening domestic economy. Alongside this pause, the government is introducing a "Buy Canadian" policy to prioritize domestic goods for federal contracts. The move comes as Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.1% after shedding 66,000 jobs in August. The long-term EV sales goals for 2030 and 2035 remain in place for now.</p>

Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander in a shooting incident that also wounded another person. The high-profile crime was previously cited by President Trump as a reason for deploying National Guard troops to the capital as part of a federal law enforcement intervention. A third suspect is also being sought in connection with the killing.</p>

          <h2>Google's Favorable Antitrust Ruling Fuels Surge in Tech Sector, Pushing Top Eight Companies' Value to $21 Trillion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 16:19:21 EDT</div>

          <p>A landmark week for the technology industry saw the combined market capitalization of the eight largest U.S. tech companies soar to $21 trillion. The surge was led by a significant rally in Alphabet's stock after a federal judge issued a more limited-than-feared punishment in its antitrust case, a decision which also boosted Apple. The ruling removed a major overhang for the companies, allowing them to continue their lucrative search partnership. These eight megacap companies now account for an unprecedented 36% of the entire S&P 500's value. (not investment advice)</p>
