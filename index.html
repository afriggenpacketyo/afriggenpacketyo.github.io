        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first six months of the current Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported nearly 150,000 individuals, putting the agency on track to exceed 300,000 removals for the year. This would mark the highest annual total since the Obama administration in 2014, though it falls significantly short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations. The effort is supported by unprecedented funding and a broader mandate, but faces operational constraints and declining public support. Agency officials state they are prioritizing dangerous criminals, but acknowledge anyone in the country illegally is subject to removal.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Efficacy of Cutting Home Sale Capital Gains Tax to Fix Housing Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:08:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are skeptical that eliminating the capital gains tax on home sales, a move floated by the Trump administration, would resolve the nation's housing market issues. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue that the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling and downsizing. However, analysts contend the tax primarily affects high-end homeowners and that a broader return of market confidence is needed to truly unlock housing inventory. The current tax applies to profits over $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples, impacting a relatively small segment of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:07:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing significant criticism after signing a law that curtails the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAP. The new legislation places these bodies under the control of the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general, sparking the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion. Western allies, including the EU, have expressed concern, emphasizing that fighting corruption is a core requirement for Ukraine's potential EU membership. Zelenskyy defended the move as necessary to cleanse the agencies of Russian influence, but critics fear it undermines years of progress in establishing rule of law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to significantly reduce the spread of malaria by making a minor genetic alteration in mosquitoes. By changing a single amino acid in the mosquito's genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from reaching the insect's salivary glands. This tweak, which could be spread through a wild population using a gene drive, was shown to reduce infective parasites significantly. While the technology is still years from field deployment and faces controversy over potential ecological consequences, it represents a promising new tool in the global fight against the deadly disease.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced he will ask a court to place Los Angeles County's troubled juvenile halls under state control through receivership. This drastic step comes after years of the county's failure to comply with court-ordered reforms amid a crisis marked by riots, drug overdoses, staff misconduct, and the death of a teenager. If approved, a court-appointed official would take over management and operations from the L.A. County Probation Department. Bonta described the move as a "last resort" to ensure the safety and well-being of the youth in custody after years of what he called "glacial progress."</p>

          <p>This article explains how credit card minimum payments are calculated, using a $2,000 balance as an example. Issuers typically use formulas such as a flat percentage of the balance (1-3%) or a percentage plus interest and fees, resulting in a minimum payment of around $40 to $60 in this scenario. The article strongly advises against paying only the minimum, as compounding interest can dramatically increase the total cost and repayment time. It suggests that paying more than the minimum is crucial for escaping debt and recommends strategies like balance transfers, debt consolidation, or seeking hardship programs if larger payments are not feasible.
