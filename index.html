          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal life sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples. Hoover, who is 74 years old, has spent nearly three decades in solitary confinement at ADX Florence, a supermax prison. While his federal sentence is commuted, Hoover still faces a 200-year state sentence for a 1973 murder. Hoover's case has drawn attention from figures like Kanye West and Drake, who advocated for his release, but some claim he still controls the gang from prison, while others view him as a Robin Hood figure.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, a blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade determined that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral power to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The lawsuit was filed by the Liberty Justice Center on behalf of small businesses importing goods from countries targeted by the duties.</p>

The surge in demand for CDS contracts is seen as a hedge against political risk and fiscal policy concerns, particularly regarding the unresolved debt ceiling. Investors are pricing in increased concerns about the debt ceiling, with the U.S. Treasury reaching its statutory limit in January 2025. The U.S. House has passed a tax cut package that could raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, pending Senate approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colombian labor unions initiated a 48-hour strike to support President Gustavo Petro's proposed referendum on labor law reforms. The strike was called in response to Congress repeatedly blocking Petro's efforts to reform labor regulations. Union members took to the streets in major cities, with some blocking public bus lanes in Bogota. The referendum seeks to allow voters to decide on issues like limiting workdays to eight hours.</p>

One of the female members used a stolen French bulldog as a cover, walking it to blend in while acting as a lookout.
