          <p>Perplexity AI is reportedly in advanced discussions to secure $500 million in funding, potentially valuing the company at $14 billion. The funding round is expected to be led by Accel, a venture capital firm based in Palo Alto. This potential funding comes after earlier reports indicated Perplexity's ambitions to raise between $500 million and $1 billion, with a valuation target of $18 billion. Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine, competes with major players like Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, and the new funds could bolster its competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli-American national, was released from Hamas captivity following a deal brokered between the group and the United States. This occurred just before President Trump's scheduled visit to the Middle East.

While his release was celebrated, relatives of other hostages expressed mixed feelings, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive deal to free all remaining captives. The New York Times article notes the release was portrayed by Hamas as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics are facing growing disapproval, with his approval rating on immigration declining. The article in The Atlantic argues that while Trump's border crackdown has been effective, his policies targeting immigrants already in the U.S., including those without criminal records, are less popular. The article highlights incidents of ICE officers arresting immigrants in public places, sparking outrage and comparisons to authoritarian regimes. As the administration seeks additional funding for its mass-deportation campaign, it faces increasing political headwinds due to public concerns about the human cost of these policies.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on the steepest tariffs between the U.S. and China is expected to lead to a surge in freight shipments, potentially driving up prices. The CNBC article reports that retailers and logistics executives anticipate a rush of imports from China as businesses take advantage of the temporary reprieve. However, the 30% tariff that remains in place, combined with rising shipping costs, is expected to increase prices for consumers. Critical industries also express concern about inventory levels and the potential for supply chain disruptions.</p>
