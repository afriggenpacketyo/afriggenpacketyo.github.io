          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the aftermath of recent strikes between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region, following weeks of escalating tensions due to a terrorist attack. India claims its strikes against terrorist sites were measured and targeted, while Pakistan asserts it successfully downed Indian aircraft. Diplomats and analysts hope the situation can de-escalate, possibly through back-channel conversations and limited actions from both sides. The article suggests that domestic pressures and economic considerations may influence each country's next move.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, potentially lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products and taxes on US tech companies. However, the specifics of the agreement are unclear, and any deal would require Congressional approval.

          <p>The British film industry is concerned about potential 100% tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" proposed by former President Trump, which could devastate the sector after pandemic and strike-related disruptions. The industry relies heavily on Hollywood blockbusters, with nearly 90% of production spending coming from abroad. While it is unclear how such tariffs would be enforced, British officials are in discussions with the U.S. government, and some suggest increased American tax breaks are more likely, posing a competitive threat. The government has increased tax breaks for smaller productions to bolster Britain's independent film industry.</p>
