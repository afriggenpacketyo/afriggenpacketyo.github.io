          <p>The European Commission has issued preliminary findings that Meta and TikTok have violated the Digital Services Act (DSA). The tech giants are accused of failing to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, a key transparency requirement under the landmark EU legislation. The Commission also found that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, have inadequate mechanisms for users to report illegal content and challenge moderation decisions. If these findings are upheld, the companies could face fines of up to 6% of their global annual turnover.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities have recovered 48 bags containing human remains from a clandestine grave in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, a region known for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel's (CJNG) activities. The discovery was made by a search group in a state heavily affected by Mexico's crisis of missing persons, which has seen over 127,000 disappearances since 2006. Officials are currently working to determine the exact number of victims from the remains found. This event highlights the ongoing violence and security challenges linked to organized crime in the country.</p>

          <p>Ivory Coast is preparing for a presidential election on October 25 amidst concerns over the nation's democratic integrity. Incumbent President Alassane Ouattara is seeking a controversial fourth term, a move made possible by constitutional changes that reset term limits. Several prominent opposition figures have been barred from running, leading to accusations that the election is a "coronation" and raising questions about its fairness. Despite a decade of strong economic growth under Ouattara, deep political divisions and regional instability remain significant challenges for the West African nation.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center has warned of potentially "catastrophic" and "life-threatening" flash flooding and landslides, with rainfall expected to reach up to 14 inches in some areas. A hurricane watch is in effect for parts of Haiti and Jamaica as the storm moves slowly through the region. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland United States, its intensification is a serious concern for the Caribbean islands in its path.</p>

          <p>Security personnel at the Coast Guard Island base in Alameda, California, discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck on Thursday night. According to the Coast Guard, the driver was operating the vehicle erratically and ignored multiple verbal commands to stop before attempting to back into the base's entrance. The shots were fired after the vehicle's actions were perceived as a "direct threat" to the safety of personnel on the base. No injuries were reported among Coast Guard personnel as a result of the incident.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive conservation effort is underway in Texas to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction, a species whose population has declined by over 90%. Scientists at the Fort Worth Zoo are using advanced assisted reproduction techniques, including hormone injections and artificial fertilization, to breed thousands of toads in captivity. These captive-bred eggs and toadlets are then released onto protected lands, such as a large property owned by Scouting America. The project also involves partnerships with private landowners, who receive tax incentives for restoring the toad's natural habitat.</p>

          <p>A viral food trend known as "Dubai chocolate" has become ubiquitous, appearing in grocery stores and on social media feeds across the globe. The confection, a chocolate bar filled with pistachio cream, tahini, and crispy knafeh pastry, was created in 2021 by Dubai-based chocolatier Sarah Hamouda. Its popularity exploded on TikTok due to its unique, crunchy texture and visually appealing, gooey interior, making it ideal for ASMR and mukbang-style videos. Despite its high price point, the trend has been embraced by major brands and has become a surprising, luxury-coded status symbol.</p>

He noted that leading Chinese tech companies such as Huawei and Tencent possess core technologies that could be systematically channeled into weapons development.

Following the 9/11 attacks, young Muslim New Yorkers developed robust political institutions to counter Islamophobia and government surveillance, steadily building influence. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, is seen as the culmination of this movement, which has successfully mobilized a growing and influential voter base. His campaign's success is attributed not just to his political skill but to a broader movement that has pushed the city's politics to the left.</p>

While he set new scoring records, MLS attendance has dipped, and streaming numbers, though up, may not reflect the transformative growth once anticipated. Google searches for Messi in the U.S. still trail those for Cristiano Ronaldo, and his presence has not yet become a major cultural phenomenon akin to 'Ted Lasso' or 'Welcome to Wrexham.' The narrative of a global superstar dominating a so-called "retirement league" has seemingly failed to capture the imagination of the average American sports fan.</p>

Some experts warn that a shutdown lasting several months could reduce GDP growth and create a "vicious cycle" of economic uncertainty.

While specialists praised the authentic portrayal of the command-and-control systems, such as the presidential "football" and the emergency video conference protocols, they questioned the film's central premise. Many believe a real nuclear attack would likely escalate from a conventional conflict rather than being a surprise strike, and would involve multiple warheads. They also noted that U.S. doctrine would likely favor riding out the initial attack to confirm the aggressor before retaliating.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays prepare for the 2025 World Series, baseball analysts are weighing in on key factors that could decide the championship. The Dodgers, seeking a repeat title, are favored due to their dominant starting pitching rotation and the star power of Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman. For the Blue Jays to succeed, they will need powerful offensive production from hitters like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer to pressure the Dodgers' starters early. Most experts predict a Dodgers victory, but acknowledge Toronto's potential if their key players perform at their peak.</p>

          <p>The recent arrests of NBA figures, including Portland coach Chauncey Billups and Miami guard Terry Rozier, in connection with an FBI gambling investigation highlight the growing perils of the league's deep ties to the betting industry. Since the legalization of sports betting, the NBA has embraced lucrative sponsorships, integrating odds and offers directly into its broadcasts. Critics argue this has created a culture where the game's integrity is compromised, making it vulnerable to scandals involving prop bets and inside information. The arrests signal that the league's strategy of partnering with the very industry it needs to police is facing a significant crisis.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that Prince Andrew received £60,500 in 2019 from Adrian Gleave, a businessman connected to SVS Securities, a firm that collapsed after being accused of mis-selling pensions. The payments were made shortly after the prince's withdrawal from public life and have renewed scrutiny of his opaque finances. SVS Securities was ordered to cease trading by regulators after it was found to have invested client pension funds in high-risk bonds to generate large commissions. This connection raises further questions about the prince's judgment and his associations with controversial business figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against drug trafficking by conducting strikes on alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean, in addition to its operations in the Caribbean. The Trump administration asserts these actions are a necessary defense against cartels, which it has designated as terrorist organizations. However, the strikes, which have killed at least 37 people, are raising significant concerns among legal experts and some lawmakers about their legality under international and domestic law. Critics question the lack of public evidence and whether the operation's true goal is countering narcotics or confronting the Venezuelan government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those unsure how to support a friend or family member with cancer, survivors suggest focusing on specific, helpful roles rather than offering vague assistance. Key roles include being a 'doctor's appointment buddy' to take notes, a 'procedure pal' for emotional and physical support during treatments, or a 'household helper' to manage daily tasks like cooking or laundry. Offering concrete help, such as bringing a specific meal or coordinating a schedule for friends, can alleviate the mental load on the patient. The most valuable support often comes from being present, listening, and taking initiative on practical needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the UK's police watchdog has found that while forces have made progress in tackling child exploitation by grooming gangs, significant challenges remain. The inspectorate noted improvements in victim support and an increase in specialist officers, but highlighted that inconsistent definitions, poor data accuracy, and a lack of national coordination are undermining efforts. Only 37% of child exploitation cases were found to be accurately flagged on police systems, indicating that opportunities to protect vulnerable children are still being missed. The report calls for universal definitions and better data collection to strengthen the police response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom increased by 0.5% in September, marking the fourth straight month of growth and defying forecasts of a slight decrease. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the unexpected rise to strong online sales of gold and new technology, such as the Nintendo Switch 2 and iPhone 17, as well as good weather boosting clothing purchases. This positive data suggests growing consumer confidence, potentially fueled by interest rate cuts and wage increases outpacing inflation. However, some economists caution that this strength may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

Opponents raise concerns about the high estimated cost, which could be between €18 and €21 billion, as well as potential increases in housing prices and negative environmental impacts.

          <p>In a significant political upset, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has won the Senedd by-election in Caerphilly, a constituency held by the Labour Party for over a century. The victory for Plaid's Lindsay Whittle is being interpreted as a potential sign that voters see the party as a viable alternative to Labour ahead of next year's Welsh Parliament election. The result is a major blow to Labour, suggesting its message is not resonating with voters despite the advantage of having aligned governments in both Wales and the wider UK. The high turnout election result challenges the political landscape of Wales.</p>
