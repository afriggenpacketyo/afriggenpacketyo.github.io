          <p>A new Bankrate report highlights the significant financial penalty of having a low credit score, terming it a "subprime tax." This manifests as higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, as well as increased insurance premiums, costing subprime borrowers an average of $3,400 extra per year. Over a 30-year period, these additional costs can accumulate to more than $100,000, underscoring the long-term value of maintaining a healthy credit score. The article suggests paying down credit card debt and making timely payments as key strategies for credit improvement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A collision occurred between Chinese and Philippine vessels near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, escalating ongoing regional tensions. The incident involved two Philippine coastguard ships escorting a fishing fleet and a China Coast Guard cutter accompanied by a naval destroyer. According to the Philippine coastguard, the confrontation happened approximately 10.5 nautical miles east of the shoal, a frequent flashpoint for maritime disputes between the two nations. This event is the latest in a series of confrontations as both countries assert their territorial claims in the strategically important waterway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a trial examining the legality of former President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a high-ranking general testified he did not hear the situation described as a "rebellion." The trial stems from a lawsuit by California's governor, which argues the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act by using the military for domestic law enforcement. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman stated the military's mission was to protect federal facilities and personnel, but he also noted that he once objected to a request for assistance he deemed low-risk. The testimony raises questions about the administration's legal justification for the controversial military action during civil protests.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has ordered the National Guard into Washington D.C. and taken federal control of the city's police force for a 30-day period, citing a need to combat what he called a "lawless" city. This move has been sharply criticized by Democrats as an illegitimate "unjustified power grab," especially as official statistics show violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low. This action has intensified the debate over federal authority and the use of military forces in domestic affairs. The article also notes global condemnation following an Israeli airstrike that killed five journalists in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The summit's location is significant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, and it follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks. Trump, who has been pushing for a resolution, aims for this to be a "feel-out meeting" to urge Putin to end the conflict, though he has also mentioned the possibility of "swapping of territories." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will reportedly be the first leader Trump calls after the summit.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has officially endorsed Georgia's Lieutenant Governor, Burt Jones, in the state's upcoming Republican gubernatorial primary. The endorsement, announced on Truth Social, highlights Jones's early and consistent support for Trump's presidential campaigns. This move is seen as a significant factor in the primary race, potentially impacting the campaign of competing GOP candidate and current Attorney General, Chris Carr. Jones celebrated the endorsement, stating his campaign is focused on election integrity and lower taxes, while reinforcing his alignment with the former president's agenda in a key swing state.</p>

          <p>A state of disaster has been declared in Juneau, Alaska, due to the imminent threat of a "glacial lake outburst flood" from Suicide Basin, adjacent to the Mendenhall Glacier. Officials warn that the volume of water in the basin has reached or surpassed levels seen in previous record-breaking flood events, with a release expected at any time. This would mark the third consecutive year of severe glacial flooding for the state capital, which has previously caused extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. In response, authorities have installed over two miles of flood control barriers along the Mendenhall River to mitigate the anticipated impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data from the UK's Office for National Statistics indicates a continued cooling of the national jobs market, with job vacancies falling by 5.8% between May and July. The number of payroll employees also saw a slight drop, with the hospitality and retail sectors being most affected. Despite the slowdown, average wage growth remained steady at 5%, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7%, suggesting a gradual rather than sharp downturn. Analysts suggest the trend may be linked to recent increases in business taxes and the minimum wage, which have made some firms more cautious about hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Sahel region, families of soldiers killed in action are reportedly being left without official notification or support from the ruling military juntas in countries like Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Bereaved families often learn of their loved ones' deaths through social media, receiving no formal condolences or financial assistance from the government. Analysts suggest the juntas, which seized power citing deteriorating security, are deliberately suppressing information about military casualties to avoid acknowledging their failures in combating terrorism. This lack of transparency creates a "war of narratives" and leaves the families of fallen soldiers to grieve in isolation and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the idea of Democrats "fighting fire with fire" by engaging in partisan gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts in states like Texas. The author contends that such a strategy is not only likely to fail, as GOP-controlled states have a structural advantage, but it also violates core democratic values of voting equality. Instead of mirroring their opponents' tactics, Democrats should differentiate themselves by adhering to democratic norms and focusing on winning elections with more attractive policy platforms. The piece warns that retaliatory gerrymandering would ultimately harm American democracy by creating a system of mirroring one-party rule at the local level.</p>

Despite this, surveys show a significant portion of Americans have either cheated or been cheated on. The piece contrasts this with more relaxed attitudes in some European countries and discusses how the public's judgment often softens for celebrities, revealing a complex and often contradictory relationship with the concept of cheating.</p>

          <p>The upcoming U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska holds deep historical significance, as the territory was a full-fledged Russian colony until its sale to the U.S. in 1867. Russia sold Alaska to pay off debts from the Crimean War of the 1850s, a conflict that, like the current war in Ukraine, involved the Crimean peninsula. While the meeting's location is practical, it underscores a shared history and a recurring theme of conflict over Crimea.

This announcement follows her record-breaking 11th album, "The Tortured Poets Department," and marks a new era for the pop superstar after a highly publicized battle to regain the rights to her first six albums.</p>

          <p>In a joint statement, leaders from 26 of the 27 European Union member states have emphasized that Ukraine's international borders must not be changed by force. The declaration comes just days before a U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska and underscores European anxiety over a potential peace deal that could legitimize Russia's territorial gains. The statement affirms Ukraine's right to decide its own future and pledges continued military support. Hungary was the only EU nation that did not sign, with its leader, Viktor Orban, warning against the EU trying to set conditions for a meeting to which it was not invited.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats is expected to surpass 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in the UK last summer. The government acknowledged the "unacceptable number" but pointed to a new "one in, one out" returns agreement with France as a measure to deter the crossings. However, the Conservative opposition has criticized the Labour government for what it calls a failure to control the border, describing the situation as a "taxpayer-funded ferry service" for people smugglers. The figures highlight the ongoing political and logistical challenges of managing illegal immigration.</p>

This acquisition secures the long-term financial future of the club, which has struggled competitively in recent seasons, finishing last in the Premiership for three consecutive years.

          <p>Germany is currently under a heat wave, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 38 degrees Celsius (100 F), prompting health officials to issue warnings. The intense summer heat has led to a dramatic increase in the production and importation of air conditioners, with domestic production up 92% in 2024 compared to the previous year. Separately, Germany's police union has called for more funding, describing the poor condition of facilities and equipment as a threat to officer safety. The union highlighted issues like moldy offices, broken heating systems, and high-mileage vehicles as problems needing urgent investment.</p>

          <p>Harmful algae blooms (HABs) are an increasing concern for Canandaigua Lake in New York, with their appearance becoming an unwelcome annual event. While the timing varies, the blooms are fueled by a combination of factors, including climate change-driven storms that wash nutrients into the lake and invasive mussels that alter the ecosystem. The Canandaigua Lake Watershed Association relies on a team of 74 volunteers to monitor the shoreline and report conditions. Officials advise lake users to be vigilant, look for visual cues like water that resembles pea soup or spilled paint, and to stay out of the water when in doubt.</p>

          <p>Advocacy groups for the homeless in Washington, D.C., are expressing alarm over former President Trump's vow to clear encampments and move unhoused individuals "FAR from the Capital." While Trump stated that the government would provide places to stay, the lack of specific details about where people would go or what resources would be provided has sparked fear and uncertainty. Advocates worry the policy will disconnect vulnerable people from essential services and support networks without offering a real solution to homelessness. They argue that dismantling encampments is a counterproductive strategy that merely displaces people without addressing the root causes of the issue.</p>

          <p>A video showing a Jefferson County Sheriff's Office deputy forcefully arresting a teenage girl at a community picnic in Kentucky has generated significant community concern. The footage shows the deputy pulling the girl by her hair and tackling her to the ground. The sheriff's office stated the girl had been verbally abusive and charged at the deputy, while witnesses dispute this, claiming the deputy's response was excessive and unnecessary. The incident has led to calls for greater accountability and improved de-escalation training for law enforcement, particularly in situations involving young people.</p>

          <p>Awdah Al Hathaleen, a 31-year-old Palestinian peace activist and documentary filmmaker, was shot and killed in his West Bank village by an Israeli settler. The incident occurred during a confrontation over a bulldozer brought into the village by the settler, who is under EU sanctions for human rights violations. Hathaleen, who co-directed the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land" about the struggle against settler violence, died from the very violence he dedicated his life to exposing. His death has drawn international attention and highlighted the increasing vulnerability of Palestinian communities amid rising settler attacks.</p>

          <p>A federal project to dredge the Mobile Bay ship channel has united an unusual coalition of shrimpers, environmentalists, property owners, and Republican officials in opposition. The controversy centers on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' practice of disposing of the dredged material within the bay itself, which critics claim is harming the local ecosystem and devastating the seafood industry. While the Corps argues that keeping the sediment in the system is beneficial for long-term renourishment, opponents are lobbying Congress to ban the practice. They advocate for using the material for coastal restoration or disposing of it in the open Gulf.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be shutting down its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with accessing the web in the 1990s, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, was a gateway to the internet for millions of Americans. At its peak, AOL was famous for distributing free trial CDs, making the internet more accessible before the widespread adoption of broadband. While dial-up has been largely replaced by faster technology, a very small percentage of U.S. households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on it for internet access.</p>
