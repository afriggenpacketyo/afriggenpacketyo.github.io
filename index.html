        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has publicly rejected claims made by the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt regarding its coverage of events in Gaza. Leavitt accused the BBC of taking down a story and altering casualty figures based on information from Hamas, but the BBC stated that it stands by its journalism and that its coverage was updated with new figures throughout the day, which is standard practice for fast-moving news stories. The BBC clarified that a separate report from BBC Verify, which debunked a viral video, was distinct from its news coverage. The BBC reiterated the importance of accurate reporting from Gaza and called for White House support in gaining access to the region, which is currently restricted for international journalists. The optimism score for this article is relatively high due to the BBC's commitment to journalistic integrity and transparency in its reporting, even in the face of criticism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed change in Trump's tax bill could eliminate the SALT deduction workaround for specified service trade or businesses (SSTB), such as doctors, lawyers, and financial advisors, once income exceeds certain limits. Currently, many states allow pass-through business owners to bypass the $10,000 SALT deduction limit by paying state and local taxes through their businesses. If the House bill passes, SSTBs would no longer be able to use this workaround, while some non-SSTB businesses could qualify for a larger QBI deduction and still claim an unlimited SALT deduction via the PTE workaround. This change could significantly impact white-collar professionals in high-tax states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French cognac businesses are hopeful that recent talks between China and France could lead to a rollback of tariffs imposed by Beijing. The tariffs were introduced in retaliation for the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, impacting the French cognac industry significantly. Guilhem Grosperrin, director of the Grosperrin family brand, expressed optimism that the Chinese government is willing to listen to their concerns. Some Chinese clients have even put orders on hold, awaiting the outcome of the negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough for the industry.

          <h2>Stanley Cup Final Becomes Proxy War: Florida vs. Canada</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Stanley Cup final between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers has taken on a deeper significance, becoming a proxy war between Florida and Canada. This narrative is fueled by Donald Trump's annexation threats against Canada, Wayne Gretzky's support for Trump, and other off-ice incidents. The Florida Panthers embody a brash, unapologetic attitude, while the Oilers represent Canada's desire to reclaim hockey's highest honors. This adds an extra layer of intensity to the already fierce competition on the ice.</p>

          <p>WorldPride, an international festival, is being held in Washington, D.C., but organizers report that attendance and sponsorship are down compared to previous years. The Trump administration's policies and rhetoric toward trans people and DEI initiatives have affected funding and participation. Corporate sponsors, wary of the administration's stance on DEI, are hesitant to support the festival. The Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C., said some choirs from abroad opted to stay home, reflecting concerns about the political climate. Despite these challenges, the festival continues with a variety of events and a strong emphasis on activism.</p>

          <p>Some current and former U.S. Census Bureau workers are concerned that the Trump administration's handling of data is causing people to decline participation in federal surveys. This distrust in government could lead to skewed statistics and nonresponse bias, especially among marginalized communities. Federal law prohibits the bureau from releasing identifiable information, but public perception of the agency may still be affected. Experts warn that public concern about the Trump administration's push to access and compile government data could have long-term consequences on the accuracy of key statistics.</p>

          <p>President Trump is doubling down on steel and aluminum tariffs, increasing the tax on imported metals to 50%. While this move is expected to boost domestic steel and aluminum companies, it raises concerns for companies that use steel, as their costs will increase. H.O. Woltz, who runs a company that twists steel wire into cables, questions how to compete with global competitors who have access to world market pricing. The higher tariffs could also lead to higher prices for consumers and slower economic growth, with some businesses fearing the unpredictable nature of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer proposed the largest increase in defense spending since the Cold War, warning that the U.K. must be prepared to fight a war in Europe. The move marks the latest shift in defense posture for a NATO member since the start of the war in Ukraine, with Starmer vowing to create "a battle-ready, armor-clad nation." The review puts Britain in line with other European-based NATO allies, including Poland and Germany, which are also increasing military spending. Uncertainty about the Trump administration's commitment to NATO is another factor at play.</p>
