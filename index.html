          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is intensifying in the eastern Atlantic and is projected to become the season's first hurricane. With maximum sustained winds approaching hurricane strength, forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center anticipate it will evolve into a large and formidable major hurricane. While not an immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain as it moves towards the northern Leeward Islands. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, highlighting its potential danger.</p>

          <p>Several top leaders from Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are expected to attend a major military parade in Beijing next month. The event will commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, referred to as Victory Day in China. According to sources, the high-level attendance from countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar signifies Beijing's growing diplomatic influence across the region. The presence of these leaders would mark a notable increase in the seniority of delegations compared to a similar parade held a decade ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent episode of NPR's 'Short Wave,' developmental biologist Crystal Rogers discusses the scientific and philosophical challenges of defining life. The conversation explores the standard criteria used in biology to classify living things, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. The episode highlights the ambiguity of these rules when applied to borderline cases like viruses, which exhibit some but not all characteristics of life. The discussion also extends to futuristic concepts, using a 'Star Trek'-themed debate to consider whether advanced androids could one day be considered alive.</p>

The judge noted that both HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement had long-standing policies against such data use, and the sudden change was made without a reasoned decision-making process. The injunction protects data from 20 states that filed a lawsuit to halt the practice.</p>

          <p>International talks in Geneva aimed at creating a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution have concluded without an agreement. Delegates from 185 countries were unable to resolve a key deadlock over the treaty's scope after 11 days of negotiations. A major point of contention was whether to impose limits on new plastic production, a measure supported by a coalition of European, African, and Latin American countries. This was opposed by large oil-producing nations and the plastics industry, who favored focusing on waste management and recycling, leading to the collapse of the talks.</p>

          <p>According to the CEO of Danish brewer Carlsberg, consumer spending habits are bifurcating the beer market, putting pressure on mid-range brands. Drinkers are increasingly choosing either premium or economy beers, squeezing the sales of traditional core brands. This trend comes as brewers face declining sales volumes due to higher prices and a shift toward other beverage alternatives. The CEO also noted that at-home consumption is growing at the expense of bars and restaurants, as customers look to save money. This reflects a broader consumer spending pause affecting the global beverage industry.</p>

          <p>With many adults experiencing sleep difficulties, especially during summer heatwaves, experts recommend several strategies to improve sleep. Regular daily exercise is shown to increase the production of the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin and reduce stress, helping individuals fall asleep faster. It is also advised to avoid caffeine within eight hours of bedtime and to reduce screen time before sleep, as device usage can disrupt natural sleep cycles. While the popular "4-7-8" breathing technique lacks robust scientific backing, its calming effects are anecdotally reported to help some people, particularly those with anxiety.</p>

The research also points to significant environmental challenges, noting that China's textile waste recovery rate is only 17 percent.

Many residents, including Ukrainian-Americans, held protests to express their anger over Putin's presence, with some stating he should be in jail rather than attending a diplomatic meeting. The summit's location in Alaska holds historical significance, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. While some locals expressed disgust at the meeting, others, including members of the local Orthodox Church and fishermen, voiced hope that the talks could lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p>

While prices in Shanghai saw a slight increase, major hubs like Guangzhou and Shenzhen continued their decline.

This significant investment shifts the dynamic for Slot, who initially arrived with modest expectations of securing a top-four finish.

          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is being held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, a location chosen for its security and historical significance. The base was a critical air defense site during the Cold War, serving as a frontline against threats from the Soviet Union. The choice of Alaska, which the U.S. purchased from Russia in 1867, adds a layer of historical resonance to the talks. The hastily arranged meeting aims to address the ongoing war in Ukraine, though White House officials have tempered expectations, describing it as a "listening exercise."</p>

          <p>The federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after an unknown white powder was discovered. The FDNY and hazmat units responded quickly to a report of the substance found in five separate letters in the mailroom on the ninth floor. At least two people were exposed to the powder, which is being tested by the FBI. Officials stated that the situation was brought under control almost immediately and that there is no remaining threat to employees or the public.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has generated a mix of apprehension and cautious optimism among residents and officials. Alaska's Governor, Mike Dunleavy, views the meeting as a necessary step for the U.S. president to assess Putin's seriousness about peace face-to-face. However, many locals are critical, with some displaying Ukrainian flags in protest and describing Putin as an international criminal who should not be welcomed. The one-on-one nature of the talks, excluding Ukraine's president, has fueled nervousness that Ukraine's territory could be negotiated away without its consent.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer allow his party to appoint members to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is undemocratic, as his party lacks representation despite receiving over 4.1 million votes in the last general election. He pointed out that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, have peers. While political appointments to the Lords are at the prime minister's discretion, Farage is pushing to address what he calls a "democratic disparity."</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have issued new guidelines for managing hypertension, emphasizing stricter limits on alcohol and sodium intake. The recommendations advise men to consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women no more than one, noting that blood pressure increases with alcohol consumption over time. The guidelines also continue to stress the importance of reducing sodium to an ideal target of 1,500 mg per day. Additionally, clinicians are now advised to recommend lifestyle changes for individuals with stage 1 hypertension, an earlier intervention than previously suggested.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s law enforcement by appointing the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, as the city's "emergency police commissioner." Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a directive stating Cole will assume all powers of the police chief and must approve any new orders from the Metropolitan Police Department. This move effectively sidelines the city's current police chief and has been labeled "unlawful" by D.C.'s Attorney General, setting up a significant legal and jurisdictional conflict between the federal government and the local city administration.</p>

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has thwarted a coup attempt, arresting a group of military officers and civilians allegedly involved in the plot. In a state television address, the security minister claimed the group had support from unspecified foreign states and was attempting to destabilize the country. Among those arrested are two generals and a French national, who was accused of being a foreign agent. The announcement comes amid a broader crackdown on dissent by the junta, which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 and has since pivoted away from Western allies toward Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts despite trade headwinds from U.S. tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong export performance, which contributed significantly to the GDP figure and helped narrow the country's trade deficit. On an annualized basis, the economy grew by 1%, more than double the forecasted rate. However, economists remain cautious, warning that a slowdown is expected in the coming quarters as corporate investment softens and the full impact of tariffs on key sectors like automobiles begins to materialize (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>According to analysis, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to enter his summit with Donald Trump with a clear strategy to exploit the U.S. president's perceived weaknesses. As an experienced negotiator, Putin will likely be master of the details and aim to steer Trump towards a peace deal on Russia's terms by offering superficial concessions. The strategy will probably involve appealing to Trump's transactional nature and his desire for a quick, high-profile resolution. Potential sweeteners could include deals on nuclear arms control or economic projects, designed to make Trump feel he is in control and emerging with a victory.</p>

The attacker, who was 17 at the time, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence. The Queensland Court of Appeal cited his early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and potential for rehabilitation as reasons for the change, reducing his minimum time served by 17 months.

          <p>A man was struck and killed by a vehicle on a freeway in Monrovia, California, while attempting to flee a raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The incident occurred near a Home Depot, a site where day laborers often gather for work, and was one of several recent raids in the area. Local officials confirmed the ICE presence shortly before the man's death, which has intensified fear within immigrant communities. The event highlights the dangerous consequences of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which critics argue terrorize families rather than improve public safety.</p>
