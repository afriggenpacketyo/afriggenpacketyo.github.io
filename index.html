          <p>The Trump administration removed a clause explicitly prohibiting segregated facilities in federal contracts, raising concerns among legal experts. While existing laws still prohibit segregation, the change is viewed as symbolically significant, potentially undermining efforts to maintain integrated workplaces.  The lack of a typical public comment period before implementation has also drawn criticism.</p>
