            <p>An unidentified intruder was apprehended near UnitedHealthcare's headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota, several months after the company's CEO, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in New York City. The suspect was found in a parking lot outside the corporate campus and surrendered peacefully to police after being spotted at a security checkpoint where he was not authorized to be. Authorities stated that the incident was unrelated to Thompson's death, for which Luigi Mangione has been charged. The FBI also responded to the scene, and police ensured that there was no threat to the public.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports, potentially leading to tariffs based on national security concerns. Notices posted to the Federal Register indicate a 21-day public comment period, with the administration intending to pursue levies under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. These inquiries must conclude within 270 days, and the President suggested flexibility for some companies. Drugmakers argue tariffs could cause shortages and reduce patient access, while the administration asserts the US needs more domestic drug manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration asserts it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a court order and Supreme Court ruling mandating his return to the US.

The Department of Homeland Security claims it cannot forcibly extract an individual from a foreign sovereign nation. Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain he has no gang affiliation and was never charged with any crimes in the US or El Salvador.</p>

            <p>The "Silicon Six" tech giants—Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft—are accused of avoiding nearly $278 billion in US corporate income taxes over the past decade.

The report highlights aggressive tax practices, including inflated tax payments and booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.

            <p>Vice President JD Vance fumbled the Ohio State University football team's national championship trophy during a celebration at the White House. As Vance went to pick up the trophy, it nearly toppled over before two players caught it, and the base dropped to the ground. Vance, an Ohio State graduate, joked about the incident on social media afterwards. The event celebrated the team's College Football Playoff National Championship win, with President Trump hosting the Buckeyes and receiving a jersey with "TRUMP 47" written on the back.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for its response to a Supreme Court order regarding a wrongful deportation case. Despite the court's directive to "facilitate" the release of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly sent to El Salvador, the administration argues it is not required to actively work with El Salvador to secure his release. Critics argue that this interpretation undermines the judiciary's ability to check Trump's power, as the administration's actions are not resulting in Abrego Garcia's release from a prison with documented human rights abuses.</p>

            <p>A vaccine expert expresses concern that child measles deaths are being 'normalized' as the U.S. experiences a significant measles outbreak, despite the disease being preventable through vaccination. The U.S. has seen over 700 measles cases and three deaths this year, raising questions about the federal response, especially given Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s history of spreading misinformation about vaccines. The effectiveness of the department's efforts is being questioned, particularly with Dr. Peter Marks, a top vaccine regulator, being forced out.</p>

            <p>China's economy traditionally aims for a strong start each spring, symbolized by the idiom "kai men hong" (open door red). However, a trend of slowing growth in the second quarter, dubbed "summer blue," has emerged in recent years. This phenomenon, characterized by declining momentum after an initial burst, has occurred in 2019, 2010, and 2012. Economists predict a robust first-quarter GDP growth for this year, but the question remains whether the "summer blue" period will materialize again. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power to levy tariffs by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The businesses assert that trade deficits, which have persisted for decades, do not represent an "unusual and extraordinary threat." The Liberty Justice Center, representing the companies, argues that the tariffs are devastating small businesses across the country. (not investment advice)</p>
