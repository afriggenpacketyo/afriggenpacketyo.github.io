        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Russian drone attack resulted in the deaths of at least nine civilians in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, just hours after Ukrainian and Russian delegations met for the first face-to-face talks in over three years. President Zelensky condemned the attack as a deliberate targeting of civilians and called for stronger sanctions against Russia. Military analysts express skepticism about ending the war this year, emphasizing that Putin's primary goal is to dismantle Ukraine's democracy and culture. A volunteer in Sumy expressed feeling betrayed by the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts, citing increased destruction and a collapse of peace due to Trump's actions or inaction. Optimism is low as the town is being heavily bombarded.</p>

          <p>Many Russian soldiers express doubt regarding peace proposals for the war in Ukraine, indicating potential domestic challenges for President Putin if he accepts terms short of his maximalist goals. In interviews, soldiers voiced skepticism towards an unconditional cease-fire, insisting that Russian forces should continue fighting until they control all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin. The soldiers' demands suggest that Putin's annexation of these regions has limited his negotiation options, as anything less would be viewed as a defeat. They also expressed bitterness towards officials and civilians, accusing them of benefiting from the war while ignoring the hardships faced on the front lines. The soldiers' comments point to difficulties in reintegrating servicemen back into civilian life after any peace deal.</p>

          <p>This article provides a summary of various news items, including the Supreme Court's extension of a ban on the Trump administration's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelans. It also mentions that the Department of Homeland Security is considering a reality TV show where immigrants compete for American citizenship. Senate Democrats oppose weapons sales to Qatar and the U.A.E. due to financial ties to Trump. The article also touches on a tornado in St. Louis, an escape from a New Orleans jail, and Moody's downgrading of the United States' credit rating.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors emphasize that long-term care costs can be a significant financial burden, often exceeding $100,000, and many Americans are unprepared for this expense. A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report indicates that over half of Americans turning 65 today will require long-term care due to disabilities. Many are unaware of the potential costs, with a majority of workers who anticipate needing to provide long-term care underestimating the future expenses. Experts recommend considering long-term care insurance, particularly hybrid policies that combine life insurance with long-term care benefits, as health insurance and Medicare often do not cover these services.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's Middle East tour advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests, despite not landing in Israel. Trump emphasized Israeli priorities such as condemning Hamas, urging Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran about its nuclear ambitions. Some analysts believe Israel missed an opportunity to leverage U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia and the lifting of sanctions on Syria to advance its interests. Concerns persist over Iran's nuclear program, with some viewing it as a historic window to stop it, potentially by force. The need for Israel to shape events proactively and anchor itself in a regional bloc is also emphasized.</p>

This work is part of broader efforts to understand the gut microbiome's role in cancer treatment, including experiments with fecal transplants and other innovative approaches.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the United States to fund President Trump's immigration crackdown. These fees, potentially amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars, would apply to asylum seekers, children, and those seeking humanitarian parole. Critics warn that these measures could create insurmountable financial barriers for vulnerable immigrants, pushing them into exploitative situations. The legislation allocates significant funds to construct a border wall, increase detention facilities, and hire additional immigration agents, reflecting the Trump administration's priority of limiting immigration.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Original Sin" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson portrays President Biden as experiencing cognitive decline, which was allegedly concealed by his family and inner circle. The book suggests that the first signs of diminished capacity emerged as early as 2015, and the White House staff treated him as very delicate. The authors argue there was a conspiracy to conceal Biden's symptoms from the press, public, and top Democrats, with his decision to run for reelection being the "original sin of Election 2024". The book also references a disastrous debate performance in late June 2024 as a turning point, leading to increased calls for him to withdraw from the race.</p>

          <p>A decline in German tourists visiting the United States is attributed to fear of harassment and detention by immigration authorities, rather than political reasons. Reports of Germans being detained and scrutinized at the border have created anxiety and uncertainty, leading to a drop in visitors. The trend has raised alarm due to the significant impact of international tourists on the U.S. economy, particularly in California. The German government issued a travel advisory, warning that U.S. border control agents have the final decision on entry, even with valid visas, and any irregularity could result in detention.</p>

The move aims to protect core city services like tree trimming, street resurfacing, and sanitation. While Mayor Bass expressed optimism about avoiding layoffs entirely, she cautioned against pitting police hiring against the preservation of other jobs, describing it as a "Sophie's Choice."</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Los Angeles Lakers should focus on drafting an experienced, mature player who has demonstrated the ability to handle the temptations of money and fame in college. The columnist suggests that the league's economic shifts have made "high ceiling" players the most sought-after quality, but the Lakers should instead consider a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders. The article highlights the importance of resiliency and maturity, which cannot be measured at the combine, and points to the success of Austin Reaves, who went undrafted as a 23-year-old senior in 2021. The author concludes that while the Lakers need a big man, they should also prioritize drafting a grown-up.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan detainees accused of being members of a violent gang, pending further litigation. The justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court to examine claims that the deportations violate the Alien Enemies Act and to determine whether the migrants were afforded sufficient due process protections. Justice Alito dissented, arguing the court lacked authority to hear the case at this stage. The ruling deals a blow to the administration's efforts to expedite deportations, especially considering the case of a Maryland man wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. While details are scarce, the UK government is considering setting up the scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg reports that an agreement in principle is expected to be announced at the upcoming summit. Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely in the rest of Europe and vice versa, and a new deal could see a return to a similar state of affairs.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it is mobilizing its forces to advance further into Gaza, seize more land, and displace more civilians, conducting intense airstrikes in preparation. However, there are no immediate signs of a wide-scale ground invasion, though some ground troops have begun to advance. These attacks come as mediators seek to broker a new truce to halt the war that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel. The UN has warned that Gaza faces a growing risk of famine after an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid. The latest Israeli attacks prompted some Palestinian civilians in the central city of Deir al-Balah to flee.</p>

However, the goal is complicated by differing views within Trump's base, as some Christian conservatives oppose IVF due to concerns about the disposal of embryos.
