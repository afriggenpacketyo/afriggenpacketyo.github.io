          <p>A resident of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, John Watkeys, shares his experience of losing part of his garden due to the Heads of the Valleys road upgrade, a project aimed at improving connectivity and prosperity in the region. While the roadworks have concluded after 23 years, Watkeys expresses the stress of fighting to keep his home intact and the disruption caused by the construction, including the loss of an oak tree and the need to rebuild his garden. Another resident, Daryl Wilkins, claims the construction caused cracks in his home. Despite the road's completion, affected residents continue to seek compensation and repairs from the Welsh government. The disruption of the roadworks has caused stress for the residents, and they are seeking compensation for the damages. The article describes how the project has affected the local environment and wildlife, and how the authorities have taken steps to mitigate the impact. The community hopes to see positive economic changes because of the road.</p>

          <p>The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reports that the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide reached 122.1 million by April 2025, driven by conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, and Ukraine. While the number decreased slightly from the end of 2024 due to Syrians returning home, the overall figure remains critically high, especially with reduced aid funding. Sudan now hosts the largest number of internally displaced people, while most refugees are hosted in neighboring countries and low to middle-income nations. Despite some positive trends like Syrian returns, funding shortfalls are hindering the UNHCR's ability to address the crisis, prompting calls for continued international support.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration raid protests has raised legal questions and prompted a challenge from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump invoked Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to justify the deployment, citing the need to protect federal property and personnel. Newsom argues that the situation does not warrant the use of federal troops and that the deployment infringes on state authority. The legal battle centers on the interpretation of presidential powers and the role of the military in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Ifo Institute has significantly raised its economic growth forecast for Germany in 2026, projecting a 1.5% increase in gross domestic product (GDP), nearly double the previously forecast 0.8%. The institute attributes this growth to new government measures and increased spending. The economic institute also adjusted its growth forecast for 2025, raising it to 0.3% from the previous outlook of 0.2%. The forecast assumes the trade war between the European Union and the US will be resolved. These factors are expected to boost the economy in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., is set to host a large-scale military parade to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, which also falls on President Trump's 79th birthday and Flag Day. The parade is expected to feature thousands of soldiers, military vehicles, aircraft, and a parachute jump. While Trump's birthday is not officially linked to the event, the parade aligns with his long-standing interest in showcasing military strength.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan that would require colleges and universities to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the federal loan debt their students fail to repay, while also rewarding schools with strong student outcomes. The risk-sharing plan aims to incentivize institutions to provide a good value for students' investment in education. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save the government over $6 billion in the next decade. Experts have raised concerns about the exclusion of defaulted loans and the potential impact on income-based repayment plans, as well as the availability of necessary data.</p>

          <p>Longtime federal employee Michele Santa Maria faces potential cuts to her retirement income due to a provision in the House-passed version of President Trump's budget bill. The provision would eliminate a special retirement supplement for federal employees who retire before they are eligible for Social Security, impacting those younger than 57 on January 1, 2028. Santa Maria, who retired early due to fears of government downsizing, estimates she could lose close to $110,000 over five years.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is employing a novel strategy of arresting migrants inside immigration courts after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses their cases, leading to expedited removals. This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard, as it circumvents the typical legal process and denies individuals the opportunity for a fair hearing. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) has detailed this approach for judges, encouraging immediate decisions on case dismissals. Critics argue that this strategy undermines due process and instills fear in immigrants who are attempting to follow legal procedures.</p>
