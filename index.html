          <p>Meta's stock experienced a nearly 3% increase after the company revealed first-quarter revenue that surpassed expectations. The company's earnings per share reached $6.43, exceeding the anticipated $5.28, while revenue hit $42.31 billion, surpassing the projected $41.40 billion. Looking ahead, Meta forecasts second-quarter sales to fall between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion, slightly above analysts' estimates of $44.03 billion. Despite these positive results, Meta cautioned that a recent decision by the European Commission could negatively impact the user experience for European users and significantly affect Meta's European business and revenue.

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have remained below 8%, averaging 7.95% this week, making them the cheapest borrowing option for homeowners. HELOC rates are influenced by factors such as the federal funds rate, the prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, and miscellaneous economic data. Borrowers should closely examine these factors to better understand when to borrow with a HELOC, as these rates are variable and change monthly. It is crucial to shop around and secure rate offers from at least three different lenders to determine which is offering the lowest HELOC rate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to cancel $1 billion in school mental health grants, stating they reflect the priorities of the previous administration and violate civil rights law. Grant recipients were notified that funding will not continue after this year, citing an education department review that found the programs conflicted with prioritizing merit and fairness. Conservative strategist Christopher Rufo claimed the money was used to advance “left-wing racialism and discrimination”. The education department plans to re-envision its mental health program funds to support students' behavioral health needs more effectively.</p>

          <p>A new study challenges the reliance on GDP as the primary indicator of national well-being, suggesting that factors like relationships, community involvement, and a sense of purpose may be more critical. The 2025 World Happiness Report ranks Nordic countries as the happiest, reinforcing the idea that wealth is a precondition for societal flourishing. However, this article highlights the limitations of using life evaluation scores, which may overemphasize wealth and status. The Global Flourishing Study, encompassing 22 countries, reveals that nations with lower GDPs, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, report higher overall flourishing due to strong social connections and religious engagement, challenging the notion that economic growth is the sole determinant of happiness.</p>

          <p>President Trump's immigration policies are facing legal challenges, particularly concerning a deportation program targeting alleged gang members. The ACLU and other civil rights attorneys argue the policies violate U.S. law. One case involves Alessandro Paredes, a Venezuelan migrant detained in Texas and facing deportation to an El Salvador prison. While border crossings have decreased, there are concerns over wrongful deportations. An ABC News poll shows Americans divided on Trump's handling of immigration.</p>

          <p>Despite his tough-guy image, President Trump has consistently appeased Vladimir Putin, raising questions about whether he will ever take a stand against the Russian leader. After a recent meeting with Ukraine's president, Trump displayed rare anger at Moscow following Russian strikes in Kyiv. Aides are exploring possible penalties for Moscow's behavior, but Trump's history with Putin suggests he will continue to defer to Russia. Some advisers believe Trump's refusal to publicly threaten Putin is a negotiating tactic.</p>

          <p>After 10 years, a HELOC transitions from the draw period to the repayment period, which means you can no longer borrow additional money, and your monthly payments will increase substantially as you pay both principal and interest. To prepare, start making principal payments early, calculate your future payments, and consider refinancing options. It is also advisable to build your emergency fund and pay down high-rate debt to manage the transition to higher HELOC payments.</p>
