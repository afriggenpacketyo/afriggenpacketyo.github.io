          <p>Emory University in Atlanta issued a shelter-in-place order on Friday following reports of an active shooter near its campus.

          <p>President Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15. The meeting comes as a deadline set by Trump for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine was set to expire, with the potential for significant tariffs on Moscow's trade partners looming. U.S. and Russian officials are reportedly working towards a deal to end the conflict, potentially allowing Russia to retain occupied territories. The summit follows a recent visit to Moscow by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, which Trump described as highly productive.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that forward Alexander Isak is currently not being involved with the team's main group. This decision follows the club's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool after Isak expressed a desire to explore other options. While the 25-year-old is not injured or officially disciplined, he is training separately from his teammates. Howe expressed a desire for Isak to return but indicated the situation is unlikely to change before the season opener against Aston Villa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is seeing a rise in COVID-19 infections, with the highest levels currently concentrated in western states, according to the latest CDC data. Nationwide wastewater monitoring has shifted from "low" to "moderate," with states like California and Alaska marked as "high" activity areas. The increase is attributed partly to the new XFG variant, also known as "Stratus," and follows a typical pattern of summer spikes in cases. Experts remain cautious about the potential severity of this wave, especially as the Trump administration recently terminated contracts for mRNA-based vaccines.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to "democratize" retirement savings but introduces assets that carry higher risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While these investments offer the potential for higher returns, experts caution that adoption may be slow due to concerns over complexity, costs, and the fiduciary responsibilities of employers.

          <p>A new documentary, “It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley,” provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the musician who died in 1997 at age 30. Director Amy Berg moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist, focusing instead on Buckley's complex personality, creative process, and internal struggles with sudden fame. The film utilizes archival footage and interviews with close confidantes, including his mother and bandmates, to create a loving and spirited portrait. It thoughtfully explores his upbringing, his artistic influences, and his final days, presenting his death as a tragic accident rather than an inevitability.</p>

          <p>Instagram has introduced a new "Map" feature that allows users to share their real-time location, sparking concerns among privacy experts about potential safety risks. The opt-in feature, which is off by default, lets users share their location with selected friends, who can then see content posted from specific spots. Despite controls, experts worry about "context collapse," where users may not fully grasp who sees their information, and the social pressures on teens. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, has acknowledged user confusion and stated the company is ensuring location is not shared without explicit consent.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a proposal from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to occupy Gaza City, a move largely opposed by both the Israeli public and the nation's security establishment. According to an analysis in The Atlantic, this decision is primarily driven by Netanyahu's need to appease the hard-right, pro-annexation parties that are essential for his narrow coalition government to remain in power. These partners advocate for annexing and resettling Gaza, a goal not shared by most Israelis, creating a significant rift between the government's actions and the strategic advice of its military leaders.</p>

The case involves the use of the Alien Enemies Act to expel migrants. In a 2-1 decision, the D.C.

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com shows that home prices are beginning to fall in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Among the 50 largest metro areas, cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with median listing prices falling nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to a growing housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>University of Southern California cornerback Prophet Brown, who had been a standout performer in preseason camp, will miss the beginning of the season due to a noncontact injury. Coach Lincoln Riley confirmed Brown would be out for at least the first few games, a significant blow to the team's defense. Brown was considered a top candidate for the starting slot corner position, and his absence will put more pressure on younger defensive backs to step up.

The University of California's president stated that a payment of this magnitude would be devastating to the public university system.

The response includes widespread insecticide fogging and efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds, with some tactics reminiscent of the country's COVID-19 measures.

          <p>The practice of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making arrests at criminal courthouses is creating a chilling effect that could slow the path to justice, according to some legal experts. Lawyers and prosecutors report that the fear of deportation is discouraging immigrant defendants, victims, and witnesses from appearing in court. This can lead to victims being unwilling to testify or seek protective orders, and defendants feeling pressured to accept plea deals. Critics argue that this tactic erodes trust and obstructs the effective functioning of the judicial system.</p>
