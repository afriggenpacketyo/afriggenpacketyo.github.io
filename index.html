          <p>A judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.  The ruling cites the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, limiting removal grounds to conduct in office.  Trump cited pre-appointment allegations of mortgage fraud as justification.  The decision ensures Cook's participation in the upcoming Fed meeting.</p>

          <p>Despite millions of vacant homes in the US, the article argues that this doesn't automatically solve the housing crisis.

Addressing abandoned homes in cities like Baltimore and Detroit is important, but not a nationwide solution.  The article suggests tackling speculative property ownership as a more targeted approach.</p>
