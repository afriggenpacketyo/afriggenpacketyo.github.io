        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a large-scale drone attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," targeting Russian airbases deep within Russia, with President Zelenskyy overseeing the operation which reportedly took over a year and a half to plan and execute. According to Ukrainian sources, the attacks, launched from mobile wooden cabins, destroyed a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet and air missile carriers, with estimated damages of billions of dollars. Russia confirmed the attacks but downplayed the extent of the damage, calling it a "terrorist act", while the White House stated they were not informed in advance. The strikes occurred as representatives from both countries prepared for another round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul, raising questions about the timing and potential impact on negotiations. The author's tone suggests cautious optimism about the potential for a shift in the conflict's dynamics. </p>

          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national and former University of Michigan student, has fled the United States after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao allegedly registered to vote and cast a ballot on campus, later admitting to the act during a conversation with school safety officials. Despite a judge's order to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. He now faces federal charges of flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China, making his return unlikely. The article provides context by mentioning the rarity of non-citizens voting in federal elections. </p>

          <p>Six people were hospitalized with burns after a suspect attacked a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, using a "makeshift flamethrower" and throwing an incendiary device. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, which the FBI is investigating as a "targeted terror attack." The victims' ages ranged from 67 to 88, and one suffered serious injuries. The attack occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot, prompting condemnation from officials and the cancellation of upcoming Run for Their Lives events. The incident reflects heightened tensions and violence amid ongoing conflicts and high-profile incidents targeting the Jewish community. </p>

          <p>The New York Yankees avoided a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 in a game where Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor performance. Yamamoto, who had been a consistent performer for the Dodgers, struggled with his command and was pulled in the fourth inning after giving up a season-high in hits. The Dodgers also made defensive and baserunning mistakes that cost them early runs. While the Dodgers showed some late-game offensive spark, it was not enough to overcome the Yankees' lead, resulting in a loss and scrutiny over their inconsistent start to the season. </p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the bonus structure for the Club World Cup, wearing shirts that read "Club World Ca$h Grab" during their warm-up. The MLS Players Association supports the protest, arguing that FIFA's new tournament increases players' workload without regard for their well-being. While FIFA will pay MLS teams substantial amounts to participate, the current collective bargaining agreement limits players' earnings from outside tournaments. The players have sought to meet with MLS to change the arrangement, but the league has not offered a reasonable proposal. </p>

          <p>A report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial pressures lead to course cuts. Universities UK found institutions reluctant to collaborate due to competition law concerns. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledges the financial challenges and supports collaboration where possible, such as sharing back-office functions. University budgets are strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, with many institutions facing financial deficits. </p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, sparking controversy. The government says the law is needed to increase black ownership of land, while critics argue it threatens property rights. The law allows expropriation without compensation in rare circumstances, such as when land is needed for public interest or when an owner is not using the land. Compensation rules are also set to change, with owners likely to receive less money. </p>

Despite serving 18 years in the Royal Navy, Williams receives a significantly lower pension than others who were discharged later.
