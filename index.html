          <p>A major Republican reconciliation bill is projected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over the next decade, potentially leaving nearly 12 million people uninsured by 2034. The legislation includes new work requirements for many recipients, which critics argue could disproportionately affect older adults and those with health issues who face barriers to employment. Health policy experts also warn that the funding cuts could lead to the closure of rural hospitals and health centers that heavily rely on Medicaid revenue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized AT&T on his Truth Social platform, complaining that technical difficulties with the carrier's equipment disrupted a conference call with faith leaders. The posts came just two weeks after the Trump Organization licensed the Trump name for a new wireless service, Trump Mobile, which will operate on all major carrier networks, including AT&T. The president's broadside against the telecommunications giant, in which he suggested he would use a different carrier next time, briefly caused AT&T's stock to dip.</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee has withdrawn a controversial provision from the Senate's Republican spending bill that would have allowed the sale of public lands in several Western states. The decision came after facing opposition from fellow Republicans in states like Idaho and Montana, as well as Democrats, who raised concerns about losing public access to recreational areas. Lee stated he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests, though he maintained his belief that the federal government owns too much land.</p>

          <p>The historic royal train, used by British monarchs since Queen Victoria's reign, will be taken out of service by 2027 as a cost-saving measure, Buckingham Palace announced. The decision was revealed in the annual royal finances report, which showed a single two-day trip on the train cost over Â£44,000, while it was used only twice in the last year. While the Royal Family will continue to use regular train services, the move is part of a broader effort to ensure "value for money" amid rising overall travel costs.</p>
