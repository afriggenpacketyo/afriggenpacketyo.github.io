        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole by California's board, a day after his brother Erik faced a similar rejection, ensuring both remain imprisoned for the 1989 murders of their parents. The parole board cited Lyle's perceived public risk, lack of self-control, and anti-social traits, despite acknowledging his positive conduct as a "model inmate." Erik's denial was primarily linked to several prison policy violations since 2013, including illicit cell phone use and past incidents of violence. Both brothers, who maintain they acted in self-defense due to alleged parental abuse, will have their next parole hearings in three years, with a possibility for Lyle's review sooner. These decisions represent a significant setback in their long-standing legal efforts for release.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Denver, and 30 other jurisdictions. The ruling protects these "sanctuary" cities and counties, which limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts, from losing billions of dollars. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders, aimed at withholding funds from non-compliant localities, as an unconstitutional "coercive threat." This decision extends an earlier order, reinforcing the legal challenge against the administration's efforts to enforce its strict immigration policies. The administration had appealed the initial injunction, but the judge found no new opposition to extending the protective measure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 2-1 to the San Diego Padres, falling back into a first-place tie in the National League West after a disappointing week that saw them squander recent momentum. Despite sweeping the Padres at home last weekend, the Dodgers split a four-game series against the last-place Colorado Rockies and then struggled offensively against the Padres in Friday's series opener. Rookie Alex Freeland hit his first career home run in the third inning, but the team managed only two more hits afterward against strong pitching from Yu Darvish and the Padres bullpen. Pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong seven-inning performance for the Dodgers, but the offense couldn't rally, leaving Shohei Ohtani on deck in a crucial eighth-inning opportunity. The team now faces renewed pressure after squandering momentum.</p>

          <p>The United States is closely monitoring China's increasing presence in the Arctic, particularly after five Chinese icebreakers and research vessels passed through the Bering Strait earlier this month. The fleet's operations, with one vessel reportedly as close as 290 nautical miles from the Alaskan coast, have sparked concerns from the US coastguard. This area is notably near the disputed "extended continental shelf" claimed by the United States, raising questions about territorial claims and resource exploration. China's intensifying interest in the resource-rich and strategically important Arctic region is viewed with suspicion by the US, highlighting growing geopolitical competition in the polar expanse and potential future conflicts over access and influence.</p>

His proposal includes withdrawing Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights, banning asylum claims for small boat arrivals, and detaining individuals on disused RAF bases for return to their home countries if agreements can be reached. While Labour dismissed the plan as "pie in the sky," and Conservatives accused Reform of recycling ideas, Farage insists radical action is necessary to deter illegal crossings. The government faces growing pressure over record asylum applications and small boat arrivals, with spending on asylum down by 12% despite increased numbers. Many of these measures could face legal challenges, but Reform's leadership remains convinced of their necessity.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars are pouring into campaigns surrounding a California ballot measure aimed at redrawing congressional districts, with a notable $10 million donation from independent redistricting advocate Charles Munger Jr. The measure seeks to replace districts drawn by an independent commission in 2021 with new ones designed to increase Democratic representation in Congress. This move by California Democrats is a direct response to efforts by Texas Republicans and former President Trump to boost GOP seats. Opponents accuse Munger of covertly supporting the GOP under the guise of defending reforms, while proponents argue it's America's best chance to fight back against what they call election rigging. The battle highlights the high stakes and partisan nature of redistricting ahead of next year's midterm elections. (not investment advice)</p>

The sign, which went viral on social media, read: "Hey Winsome, if trans can’t share your bathroom, then Blacks can’t share my water fountain," drawing parallels to Jim Crow-era segregation. Earle-Sears was speaking at an Arlington County school board meeting reviewing its transgender bathroom policy when the incident occurred. Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares, both Republicans, denounced the sign as "idiocy" and "wrong," respectively. Democratic state Senator Ghazala Hashmi also condemned the poster, saying it evokes the "pain of racism, segregation and Jim Crow-era ugliness," emphasizing that such bigotry has no place in Virginia's politics or communities.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has announced a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, aiming to keep these globally prized raw materials onshore to foster investment in downstream industries. This move signals Malaysia's intention to leverage its rare earth reserves for its own development, especially as the mineral-hungry United States seeks non-Chinese sources amid strained trade ties with the world's dominant supplier, China. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities give it a significant advantage in integrating into global supply chains. The ban applies equally to all countries, indicating Malaysia's commitment to prioritizing its national economic development and exercising its geoeconomic agency, potentially attracting foreign investment that involves local processing, job creation, and technology transfers.

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the preferred listing venue for mainland Chinese companies, surpassing the US in initial public offerings (IPOs) during the first eight months of 2025. Chinese firms raised US$16.5 billion in Hong Kong through 46 IPOs, significantly more than the US$740.9 million from 16 listings in the US. This shift is attributed to Hong Kong's more active capital market, higher average trading debut jumps (19.4% vs. 3.6% in the US), and ongoing US-China rivalry, which introduces lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets. The trend marks a major milestone for Hong Kong as it strengthens its role as a global financial hub, benefiting from clearer regulatory prospects for mainland firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that air pollution from oil and gas activities disproportionately affects Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities in the US, leading to an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually. The research, published in Science Advances, links fossil fuel pollution to 10,350 preterm births and 216,000 new childhood asthma cases yearly, with California ranking highest in overall impact, particularly Los Angeles County. The greatest harm stems from later stages of the oil and gas life cycle, such as exhaust from factories and vehicles, accounting for 96% of incidents. This disparity is attributed to historical zoning practices like "redlining," which concentrated these communities near pollution hotspots, highlighting a profound environmental injustice.</p>

The firm was widely criticized for its "five-minute payment rule," which stipulated drivers must pay within five minutes of entering, and was later banned by the private parking sector. Robinson, who initially paid some charges but then appealed 67 unpaid notices totaling £11,390, received free legal aid and won her case, with the judge deeming the rule "inherently preposterous." The judge ordered Excel to pay legal costs to the Access to Justice Foundation, citing the firm's "unreasonable" conduct. Excel, however, still maintains its terms were lawful and continues to pursue similar cases against other drivers, prompting calls for government intervention.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department released over 300 pages of transcripts from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell regarding Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence, provided details on her relationship with Epstein and other high-profile figures, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. She denied witnessing inappropriate behavior from Trump and stated Clinton was "my friend, not Epstein's friend," also denying he received massages or visited Epstein's private island. Maxwell also claimed a famous photo of Prince Andrew with an accuser was "fake" and reiterated her belief that Epstein did not die by suicide, but also wasn't murdered externally, suggesting an "internal situation" if foul play occurred. These transcripts offer Maxwell's perspective on the complex and controversial Epstein case.</p>

          <p>An explosion and fire at Smitty's Supply, an automotive supply company in Roseland, Louisiana, sent large flames and thick black smoke into the air, forcing nearby residents and an elementary school to evacuate within a one-mile radius. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, which officials called a "godsend" given the intensity of the inferno. The Tangipahoa parish president stated that the cause of the explosion is unknown, and the extent of any chemical risk or the time needed to control the blaze remains unclear. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency are on scene, monitoring the situation to guide response efforts as fire crews work to extinguish the active fire.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton in Bethesda, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., respectively, confirming "court authorized activity" related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump stated he learned of the raid from TV and called Bolton "a lowlife" and "unpatriotic," adding that he expected a briefing from the Justice Department. FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media about "no one is above the law" and "justice will be pursued." This action follows a previous criminal inquiry into Bolton for allegedly publishing classified information in his critical memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," though he was never charged. The search raises questions about political motivations and the handling of classified materials, especially given Trump's past grievances with Bolton.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Polling in Britain suggests a growing political divide, with young women increasingly leaning left-wing and young men more likely to support right-wing parties, particularly Reform UK. A 2025 survey found 20% of young British women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with young women showing strong support for the Green Party. Experts attribute this gap to factors like higher education rates among women, which correlate with socially liberal attitudes, and the significant influence of social media. Some suggest young men are drawn to populist right-wing parties that express support for traditional gender roles, while young women seek a more progressive future and fight to protect their freedoms. This trend indicates a shift in traditional party loyalties and a generational gender gap in political alignment.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts provided some, but not full, relief for Donald Trump, who has faced pressure over his association with Jeffrey Epstein and the handling of related files. Maxwell's statements largely supported Trump's efforts to distance himself, denying she ever saw him in "any type of massage setting" or acting inappropriately, and not recalling him sending a "bawdy" birthday note to Epstein. However, the transcripts, which also extensively questioned Maxwell about Bill Clinton, are unlikely to satisfy conspiracy theorists or many of Trump's supporters seeking more incriminating details about a "powerful cabal." The episode highlights the ongoing political sensitivity and public demand for transparency surrounding the Epstein case, even as Maxwell's own credibility remains under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington DC to be armed, reversing a previous decision, as the Trump administration intensifies its crime crackdown. President Trump, who deployed approximately 2,000 troops and took control of the city's police, lauded the mission as bringing "total safety" and considered expanding it to Chicago. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the idea, calling it "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound," and warning it could "inflame tensions." While the administration touts over 700 arrests and 91 illegal firearms seized, polls show the deployment is deeply unpopular with nearly 80% of DC residents, and Trump is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the mission beyond its 30-day deadline.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging to pursue charges vigorously. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are poor indicators of public safety, as only a fraction typically lead to criminal charges or convictions. They note that "flooding the zone" with law enforcement can inflate arrest figures for minor infractions and increase the risk of police uses of force. With over 2,000 federal officers deployed, the strategy's effectiveness in deterring violent crime long-term is questioned, and concerns are raised about potential rights violations and lack of transparency regarding who was arrested and why, especially with a significant portion being immigration-related.</p>

Fire risks remain exceptionally high across the American West due to hot, dry, and unstable conditions, exacerbated by low humidity and a chance of dry thunderstorms that could spark more blazes.

          <p>The FBI raid on John Bolton's home is perceived by many as a warning shot in President Trump's intensified campaign against the "deep state," following years of Trump vowing retribution against his critic. This event occurred alongside other significant actions, including the firing of Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the revocation of security clearances for dozens of current and former national-security officials by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Experts describe the mood among intelligence officers as "panicked," fearing a chilling effect on dissent and a politicization of their historically apolitical work. The context suggests a broader effort to terrorize the workforce and consolidate political control, raising concerns about the integrity and independence of intelligence agencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, a "third country" that recently agreed to accept non-citizens from the US. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year despite an immigration judge ruling he feared persecution by local gangs there. He was recently released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee, and his attorneys subsequently received a court-required notice of potential deportation to Uganda within 72 hours. This move reflects the administration's increasing use of "third country" agreements for undocumented immigrants, even as Abrego Garcia plans to return to his family in Maryland, where a judge ruled he must receive 72 hours' notice for deportation proceedings.</p>

The families, many of whom received concrete instead of their loved ones' ashes and carried empty urns for years, sought a more severe punishment than the proposed 20-year concurrent sentence. Hallford and his wife, Carie, ran a fraudulent scheme, letting bodies decompose and some found unclothed or in fluid, while maintaining a lavish lifestyle with nearly $900,000 in stolen pandemic relief aid.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crackdown on homeless encampments in Washington D.C., involving federal agents clearing sites, mirrors a controversial strategy recently implemented in San Francisco. San Francisco's approach, which followed a Supreme Court ruling allowing citations for sleeping rough, has significantly reduced visible tent encampments but hasn't solved the underlying homelessness crisis, with overall numbers still rising. While local businesses welcomed the change, advocates criticize criminalizing homelessness as punitive and ineffective, arguing it merely cycles individuals through neighborhoods without addressing root causes like mental health, addiction, and housing shortages.

Despite five summer signings, defensive vulnerabilities, particularly from set-pieces, are evident, with the goalkeeper at fault for two goals against Chelsea. While the club traditionally supports its managers, fans' boos and early departures signal growing discontent.
