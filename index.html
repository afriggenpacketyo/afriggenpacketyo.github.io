          <h2>Japanese Survey Reveals Majority Support for Social Media Regulation During Elections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 23:36:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that approximately 58% of Japanese citizens believe that social media platforms should be regulated by law during elections to combat the spread of misinformation. The survey highlights growing concerns about partisan online content influencing election outcomes, particularly following a recent gubernatorial election. While Japan enacted the information distribution platform law to address defamatory content, its impact remains limited. The survey also revealed divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames, reflecting evolving social attitudes in Japan. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report, the Trump administration intends to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions and other intelligence agencies by thousands, through reduced hiring and voluntary resignations. The CIA stated that these changes align with Trump's national security priorities and aim to infuse the agency with renewed energy. These cuts include the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies. John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, aims to enhance human intelligence gathering and focus on China, reflecting a shift in strategic priorities. Optimism score is 50.</p>
