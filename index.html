          <p>WNBA star Angel Reese has been suspended by the Chicago Sky for the first half of their upcoming game against the Las Vegas Aces. The team deemed recent comments she made as "detrimental to the team," separate from a one-game suspension she served for accumulating eight technical fouls. Reese had previously expressed frustration with the franchise's direction, suggesting she might need to "move in a different direction," though she later walked back these remarks and apologized. The Sky organization stated the matter has been resolved internally as they focus on team accountability.</p>

          <p>A recent military parade in Beijing, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, revealed significant advancements in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). The event featured the public debut of three new branches: the Information Support Force, the Military Aerospace Force, and the Cyberspace Force. These units marched alongside their latest equipment for electronic countermeasures and cyber warfare, signaling a strategic shift towards integrated, high-tech, cross-force operations. Observers interpret this as the PLA's evolution into a force capable of operating across all modern warfare domains.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has disavowed comments made by a conference speaker, Dr. Aseem Malhotra, who suggested a link between COVID-19 vaccines and the cancers affecting the King and the Princess of Wales. Dr. Malhotra, citing an oncologist, claimed the vaccines were a "significant factor," a view widely discredited by medical professionals and described as an "outlandish conspiracy theory." Health Secretary Wes Streeting called it "shockingly irresponsible" for the party to provide a platform for such claims. Reform UK stated it does not endorse the views but believes in free speech.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm, is currently moving through the Pacific Ocean on a path that could impact Hawaii early next week. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warn that swells from the storm are expected to reach the islands by Sunday, creating life-threatening surf and rip currents. While no coastal warnings are in effect yet, potential direct impacts like heavy rainfall and strong winds could begin Monday.

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, but the performance revealed vulnerabilities. Despite the 40-point winning margin, England struggled in the first 30 minutes, unsettled by Australia's intensity and effective kicking game. The team's usually reliable driving maul was initially inconsistent, with several fumbles and disruptions. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the untidy attack but praised the team's outstanding defense, which kept Australia scoreless in the second half, though stronger rivals may exploit these weaknesses.</p>

          <p>At least 60 people, including several soldiers, were killed in a jihadist attack on the town of Darul Jama in Nigeria's Borno state. Residents reported that dozens of armed fighters, identified as members of Boko Haram, arrived on motorcycles and began shooting indiscriminately while setting homes on fire. Many of the victims were people who had only recently returned to the town after being displaced for years by the ongoing insurgency. The attack represents a significant setback for regional security and efforts to resettle displaced populations.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the tower was used by Hamas, a charge the group denies. This action is part of an expanding military operation in the city, with Israel urging remaining civilians to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. The destruction of these towers, symbols of development after the Oslo Accords, is described by Palestinian officials as a policy of forced displacement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to reject a request from NBC News to unseal the names of two individuals who received large payments from Jeffrey Epstein in 2018. The two unnamed associates, described as potential co-conspirators, received payments of $100,000 and $250,000 shortly after an investigation into Epstein's lenient 2008 plea deal was published. Prosecutors cited these payments as potential evidence of witness tampering. The DOJ's argument for continued secrecy is based on the privacy interests of the two uncharged individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appeared to renew his threat to deploy troops to Chicago, sharing a post on Truth Social that parodied the film "Apocalypse Now" with the line, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." This follows his administration's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., for similar crackdowns on crime and immigration. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the threat, stating Trump was "threatening to go to war with an American city."

However, this optimism soon gave way to concerns that the slowing labor market signals a broader economic downturn, causing major indices to reverse their gains. The week highlighted Wall Street's dilemma in balancing the desire for lower borrowing costs against the risk of a weakening economy. (not investment advice)</p>
