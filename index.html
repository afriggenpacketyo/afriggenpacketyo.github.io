        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, recognizing the increasingly challenging security environment. During a meeting with young SDF members in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the importance of appropriately compensating them for their duties and the risks involved. This announcement follows the enactment of a revised law that includes new allowances for SDF members, addressing a serious shortage of recruits that Ishiba's cabinet has been aiming to tackle since last October. The move comes at a time when public trust in the SDF has been impacted by scandals, including sexual abuse cases, amidst government efforts to bolster the nation's defense capabilities in response to geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchange negotiations, Russia launched a series of intense drone and missile attacks across Ukraine, resulting in casualties and widespread damage. Ukrainian officials reported that at least 12 people were killed, including children, and over 60 were injured, with numerous residential buildings damaged. Ukraine's air force reported that a total of 367 "air attack vehicles" were launched, including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, guided air missiles, and attack drones, many of which were successfully intercepted. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate strikes on ordinary cities and residential areas, reiterating calls for stronger international pressure and sanctions against Russia to halt the ongoing brutality.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government called the move a "new dawn for rail" but held back from promising lower fares, focusing more on plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing staffing for security, cleaning and other areas to private companies. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that while she couldn't promise lower ticket prices, she would ensure customers receive good value for money, noting that taxpayers subsidize the trains by Â£2 billion annually.</p>

          <p>A 1990 trading card featuring Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents, has unexpectedly become a collector's item. The card, which features New York Knicks guard Mark Jackson, gained notoriety after collectors noticed the Menendez brothers sitting courtside in the background. While the card was previously worth only cents, the discovery of their presence led to a surge in value, with some listings reaching hundreds of dollars. The brothers, who are now eligible for parole after resentencing, are scheduled to appear before the parole board via video on June 13, 2025.</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles, raising questions about how to leverage Chinese investment in the sector. A debate is ongoing across Europe regarding whether China's expertise in the EV sector will create jobs or harm domestic industries. Windrose Technology, a Chinese company, recently announced plans to build a â‚¬175 million factory in northern France, with ambitions to produce 4,000 electric lorries annually from 2027. Despite only having 30 trucks on the roads worldwide, Windrose aims to expand to the United States and pursue stock exchange listings in both countries.</p>

          <p>Sir Alan Bates, the former subpostmaster who has been campaigning for redress for victims of the Post Office scandal, has criticized the government's compensation offer, stating that it amounts to less than half of his claim.

He accuses the government of presiding over "quasi-kangaroo courts" and altering the "goal posts" on their judgements. Bates is advocating for an independent body to oversee compensation schemes for public sector scandals, emphasizing that promises made to subpostmasters have proven worthless.</p>

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes in Nottinghamshire, a virologist from the University of Nottingham has urged the public to remain calm. Professor Jonathan Ball stated that climate change is likely to increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases, making it essential to be aware of the potential risks. He emphasizes that while the general public does not need to be overly concerned, mosquito surveillance projects will be conducted in areas like Gamston to monitor mosquito activity. Ball advises people to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide, noting that the virus primarily affects birds and mosquitoes, with only a small percentage of human infections leading to severe illness.</p>

The 5,000-ton-class ship sustained damage to its stern during the launch ceremony, attended by leader Kim Jong Un, who has criticized the event as a "criminal act."
