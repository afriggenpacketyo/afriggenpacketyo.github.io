          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of issuing paper checks, transitioning nearly 70 million recipients to electronic payments by September 30th. Beneficiaries will now receive funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the agency states will enhance security and efficiency. This change follows a 2025 executive order mandating the digitization of all federal payments, although exceptions will be made for individuals who cannot receive electronic deposits, such as the unbanked population.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has renewed his argument for the U.S. to regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, primarily citing its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites. While experts note China's main manufacturing is deeper inland, a significant test range is located about 1,200 miles from Bagram. The Taliban has rejected any proposal to hand over the base, referencing the 2020 Doha agreement, despite Trump's suggestions of potential negotiations and threats of consequences.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has begun a "phased restart" of its operations after a significant cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. While some financial and parts logistics systems are back online, its manufacturing plants remain closed, impacting an extensive supply chain. The UK government is reportedly working on a support package for affected suppliers, as concerns grow over the financial viability of smaller businesses dependent on the carmaker's operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has linked its support for Argentina's new government to the rollback of an approximately US$18 billion credit line from China. U.S. officials have communicated to President Milei's delegation that this financial dependence on Beijing poses a long-term risk to Argentine sovereignty and facilitates Chinese influence in the region. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously indicated a preference for the deal to be wound down, signaling that direct U.S. credit lines were not being considered.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy recounted how his perspective on the Ryder Cup transformed from viewing it as a mere "exhibition" to a deeply meaningful event. He pinpointed a 2010 team conference call with a sick Seve Ballesteros as the pivotal moment, where he witnessed the emotional weight the tournament held for his European teammates. Seeing the majority of the team in tears while listening to the golf legend solidified his understanding of the Ryder Cup's profound significance beyond individual achievement.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Virginia have concluded a two-month investigation, determining there is no probable cause to bring criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this finding, which was detailed in a declination memo, newly appointed U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury before the statute of limitations expires. This move follows President Trump's public directive to prosecute political adversaries, creating tension within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Suggestions that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham might challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour Party leadership have been met with a backlash from many Labour MPs. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand amid government scandals, a BBC survey indicates little appetite for a leadership change. Many MPs expressed that such a move would be self-indulgent and damaging to the party, urging Burnham to focus on his current role instead of speculating on national leadership.</p>

          <p>Following a BBC investigation that revealed asylum seekers were being transported on long, expensive taxi journeys for appointments, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated the practice must stop. The investigation found instances like a 250-mile trip to a GP costing £600, paid for by the government. Sir Keir called the practice "not right" and reiterated his goal to close asylum hotels as quickly as possible, while the Home Office has launched an urgent review into the transportation costs.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has criticized the Trump administration for engaging in "crony capitalism" by making special deals with large corporations to exempt them from tariffs. Griffin argued that allowing the government to pick winners and losers is fundamentally anti-American and ultimately harms everyone. He described tariffs as a "national sales tax" that raises fairness issues and warned that companies seeking favors from one administration may find themselves out of favor with the next.

          <p>New CDC data from 2024 reveals a concerning trend: while overall rates of sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia and gonorrhea fell among adults, cases of congenital syphilis in newborns increased for the 12th consecutive year. Nearly 4,000 cases were reported, marking a nearly 700% increase over the past decade. Public health officials express distress over the rise, attributing it partly to insufficient screening during pregnancy, which can lead to severe health issues or death for infants.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has ruled that the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance partially breached editorial guidelines on harm and offence. The ruling cited the band leading a chant of "death, death to the IDF" and making other derogatory and antisemitic comments. However, the unit cleared the broadcast of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime, stating the chants were directed at an institution and that festival coverage has different standards than news programming.</p>

Bompastor, who led her team to a domestic treble, noted that while Chelsea did not ask this question, the industry still has significant room for improvement regarding gender bias.</p>

          <p>According to a Cox Automotive analysis, U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost, with the 2025 forecast raised to 16.1 million units. This resilience is attributed to consumers buying cars sooner to avoid anticipated higher prices resulting from potential tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. While this has benefited automakers like General Motors and Toyota in the short term, analysts expect the sales pace to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>
