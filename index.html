          <h2>Japan's Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction in Early 2025</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New economic data reveals that Japan's economy shrank more than anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% contraction attributed to sluggish consumption and declining exports. This marks the first quarterly drop since early 2024, exacerbated by US President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on Japanese goods. Uncertainty surrounding these tariffs is expected to further hinder economic growth, as Tokyo struggles to negotiate trade deals with the US amidst shifting policies. With an aging population and rising welfare costs, Japan's economy faces vulnerabilities, raising concerns about a potential recession despite the central bank's efforts to boost the economy through gradual interest rate hikes.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation following an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some interpreted as a call for violence against President Trump. Comey later deleted the post, claiming he was unaware of the violent connotations associated with the numbers and that he opposes violence of any kind. Despite his explanation, Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, condemned the post, asserting that it constituted a threat against the President. The Secret Service and FBI are reportedly investigating the incident, highlighting the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration since his firing in 2017.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a significant political shift as far-right candidate George Simion leads in the presidential elections, following in the footsteps of a previously barred candidate. The article suggests that Simion's rise is rooted in decades of economic failures, including chronic underdevelopment and mass emigration, which have fueled anti-establishment sentiment. The author criticizes both Simion and his opponent, Nicusor Dan, for lacking concrete plans to address socioeconomic issues, highlighting the country's high in-work poverty and low welfare spending. With Simion likely to win the runoff, Romania faces a potentially disastrous turn of events, mirroring the economic nationalism seen in Viktor Orban's Hungary.</p>

          <p>Despite being named Scotland's team of the year after their first World Cup appearance, the Scotland women's cricket team faces a precarious future due to a lack of scheduled fixtures and insufficient funding. The team has not played at home since 2023, and prohibitive costs make it difficult to organize matches, even with willing touring countries. Players express frustration over the lack of opportunities for development, feeling helpless without the necessary financial support. Cricket Scotland receives limited funding from the ICC, making it challenging to sustain the women's program, and the team is seeking more interaction with England's men's and women's teams to provide regular fixtures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of Japanese assets, the largest net inflow since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, seeking diversification in response to Trump's tariffs. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the surge in investment highlights Japan's appeal as a safe-haven market during times of global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says is mandated by the state's abortion ban. The 30-year-old mother, Adriana Smith, was declared brain-dead in February, but remains on life support as she is 21 weeks pregnant. The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, prevents them from making decisions about her medical care. Bioethicists note that Georgia law does not explicitly require continued life support in such cases, raising ethical and legal questions about fetal rights versus the family's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.2% contraction in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. Preliminary government data indicates that uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Trump's trade policies negatively impacted Japan's export-driven economy. Despite this, domestic demand showed resilience, contributing positively to GDP growth. Experts suggest that while Japanese companies are strong domestically, exports may continue to face challenges due to competition from China.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation for a social media post featuring seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some officials interpreted as a threat against President Trump. Comey later deleted the post, explaining that he was unaware of the violent connotations associated with the numbers and opposes violence. Despite his explanation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted that Comey "just called for the assassination" of Mr. Trump, prompting an investigation by the Secret Service. The incident highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit rail engineers have gone on strike, bringing train service to a halt and leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters scrambling for alternative transportation. The strike, stemming from a dispute over pay raises, affects both NJ Transit and Metro-North's west of Hudson service. NJ Transit is advising people to work from home if possible, while Governor Phil Murphy considers a state of emergency. The agency has implemented a contingency plan involving additional bus service, but it can only accommodate a small percentage of the usual train riders.</p>

          <p>Europe is warned to reform quickly or become a “shock absorber” of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances. The climbdown in superpower tensions following high-wire talks in Geneva last weekend has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs and a respite in the turmoil that has roiled markets since US President Donald Trump ’s return to the White House in January. “There is talk in Brussels of Europe becoming a ‘third pole’ in a bipolar world dominated by the US and China,” said Michael Pettis, a finance professor at Peking University. “But without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, this ambition risks remaining a slogan rather than a strategy.”</p>

Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. This week, the struggling company said it would lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories but did not say where the cuts would be made. The Japanese firm, which employs thousands of people in the UK, told the BBC it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally."</p>

          <p>Increasingly, when lawyers take divisive political issues to court, they seek out federal jurisdictions where they hope to find judges sympathetic to their worldview. This phenomenon, known as venue shopping, has been employed by both sides of the political aisle, according to a new CBS News analysis of federal court data for cases seeking nationwide impact. Almost every federal district court now follows that guidance. There's really only one invisible holdout, pointing to the Northern District of Texas, where there are district court satellites run by only a single judge or two. If the justices decide to lift the nationwide pause and limit the scope of the injunctions, it could have far-reaching consequences.</p>

          <p>After two days of testimony about how her relationship with Sean "Diddy" Combs grew violent and coercive, Cassie Ventura faced six hours of grueling cross-examination on Thursday, as defense attorneys attempted to cast doubt on her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. Ventura openly acknowledged in both her direct and cross-examinations that she loved Combs for more than a decade and hoped to build a life with him. Jurors also saw messages from August 2009, when the couple first went public with their relationship, and other messages from more than two years into their relationship. Defense attorneys pressed Ventura about the flaws in her relationship with Combs, arguing the jealousy and infidelity went both ways for the couple.</p>

The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include 'to reject' or 'to get rid of', according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning 'to kill'. Trump is the 47th US president. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged the message was a call for the assassination of Trump, but Comey said he opposed violence.</p>

However, migrating endangered humpback whales are now swimming in the same waters outside the Golden Gate strait where crabs are, and long lines of rope that fishermen traditionally use to pull up crab cages have entangled too many humpbacks. Since 2007, at least 922 humpback whales have been maimed or killed by these ropes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The commercial Dungeness crab season traditionally starts in November and runs through about May.</p>

The US and UAE did not say which AI chips could be included in the data centers, but sources told Reuters the UAE could be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips per year starting in 2025.
