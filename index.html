          <p>A 10-year-old boy has died and four other people remain in the hospital following a tragic school coach crash in Somerset, UK. The coach, which was carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School on a trip from the zoo, left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. A major incident was declared, and the community has since come together to pay respects and leave tributes at the school. Several local fundraisers have collected over £40,000 to support those affected by the horrific incident. Police have recovered the vehicle and are continuing their investigation into the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, the celebrated centenarian marathon runner, was killed at the age of 114 after being struck by a speeding SUV in his home state of Punjab, India. Singh, who gained global fame for completing marathons after the age of 89, was a symbol of endurance and vitality. His tragic death has cast a spotlight on India's perilous road conditions, where over 150,000 people die in traffic accidents annually. While police have arrested a suspect for the hit-and-run, road safety experts argue that poor infrastructure, such as a lack of pedestrian crossings on busy highways, is a major contributing factor to the country's high fatality rate.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Hostage Families Express Growing Distrust in Government's Handling of Negotiations</h2>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are increasingly voicing their mistrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, believing it is not prioritizing a deal for their loved ones' release. Protesters gathered in Jerusalem, expressing frustration over the prolonged captivity and the selection process that determines who gets freed. Gil Dickman, whose cousin Carmel Gat was killed in captivity after a previous truce collapsed, highlighted the painful feeling of 'deja vu' a year after meeting with Netanyahu. Many families now place more hope in the U.S. administration to pressure Israel into securing a comprehensive deal for the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "I Regret Almost Everything," renowned New York restaurateur Keith McNally opens up about his life, including a debilitating stroke in 2016 and a subsequent suicide attempt. The founder of iconic eateries like Balthazar and The Odeon discusses how his condition, which affected his mobility and speech, led him to embrace social media as a new form of communication. He also reflects on public controversies, such as his viral post criticizing James Corden, admitting he later felt bad about the humiliation it caused. McNally's book offers a candid look at his struggles with physical recovery and public perception.</p>

          <p>England and Gotham FC defender Jess Carter has announced she is taking a step back from social media after being subjected to "a lot of racial abuse" during the Euro 2025 tournament. In a statement, Carter clarified that while fans are entitled to opinions on performance, targeting someone's race or appearance is unacceptable. The Football Association and her U.S. club have condemned the abuse and are working with police to bring the perpetrators to justice. In a related move, the Lionesses team stated they will no longer take a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism in football.</p>

While advocating for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and innocent individuals mentioned in the files. He also responded to criticism from President Trump, who had called such demands "foolish," stating that while he was annoyed by the comments, he remains focused on the issue. Burchett expressed cautious optimism about Attorney General Pam Bondi's recent move to unseal grand jury evidence, calling it a positive first step.</p>

          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game warm-ups, players sent a clear message to league officials by wearing T-shirts that read, "Pay Us What You Owe Us." The protest comes amid contentious collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations, with the current deal set to expire in October. Players argue that with the league's business booming—evidenced by a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees—they deserve a significant salary increase. While WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism about reaching a transformational deal, the players' public demonstration highlights the serious divide that remains.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in psychology suggest that individuals can intentionally redesign aspects of their personality, challenging the long-held belief that personality is fixed in adulthood. The article highlights the work of writer Olga Khazan, who documented her year-long effort to become less neurotic and more extroverted in her book "Me, But Better." According to Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, by consciously and repeatedly changing one's thoughts and behaviors—a process she likens to "fake it 'til you make it"—it is possible to shift seemingly intractable traits. This approach involves stepping outside one's comfort zone, for instance by trying improv comedy to combat social anxiety.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for reinstating the Confederate names of several U.S. army bases, an action that appears to circumvent a 2021 law. The law, passed by Congress, mandated the removal of these names. Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different American soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, a move seen by critics as a disingenuous loophole. The House Armed Services Committee recently voted to block this effort, highlighting a rare instance of congressional Republicans rebuking the Trump administration for flouting established law.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. The survey also reveals that a large majority of Americans, across party lines, believe the administration should prioritize lowering prices over other issues like tariffs. Despite these concerns, President Trump's core MAGA base remains strongly supportive of his policies, particularly on immigration, though his overall approval has slipped. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Department of Justice memo prioritizing the denaturalization of U.S. citizens has instilled fear among the nation's 25 million naturalized immigrants. The article, written from the perspective of a naturalized citizen, argues that this policy shift creates a "second class" of citizenship, where rights are not guaranteed. It raises concerns that the vague criteria for denaturalization, such as being "sufficiently important to pursue," could be used to target political opponents and chill free speech. This move is seen as a fundamental challenge to the constitutional principle that citizenship, once granted, is permanent and protects the right to have rights.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that recent U.S. trade policies toward the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) represent a strategic shift from mutual partnership to a transactional, rent-seeking model. Instead of fostering economic integration, Washington is allegedly monetizing access to its market by imposing dramatically higher tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases. The article contends that this approach undermines the economic competitiveness and sovereignty of ASEAN members like Vietnam and Indonesia. It concludes that while this strategy might yield short-term gains for the U.S., it damages long-term strategic relationships by treating allies as sources of revenue rather than partners.</p>

This shift in development finance is enhancing Beijing's regional power through projects like high-speed rail links.

          <p>The Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders for parts of Deir al-Balah, a densely populated city in central Gaza that has so far been spared a ground offensive. The directive has caused widespread panic among residents and the thousands of displaced people sheltering there. Leaflets dropped from the air instructed people to move to the al-Mawasi coastal area. The move could signal an imminent ground assault on the area, where it is feared some of the remaining Israeli hostages are being held. This order comes as the humanitarian crisis deepens, with reports of dozens killed while awaiting aid deliveries elsewhere in the Strip.</p>

          <p>A tsunami warning for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and a watch for Hawaii have been canceled after a series of five powerful earthquakes struck off the coast on Sunday. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 7.4 at a shallow depth, prompting initial alerts for potentially dangerous waves from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Russian authorities also issued a warning, advising coastal residents to move away from the shore. Fortunately, the danger passed without incident, and there were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity or any resulting waves in the region.</p>

          <p>Health agencies are warning of an increased risk of vibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio bacteria, in European coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas due to rising sea temperatures linked to climate change. These bacteria thrive in warmer, low-salinity water and can cause serious illness, particularly in individuals with open wounds or compromised immune systems. Infections typically occur from consuming raw shellfish or through skin contact with contaminated water. To stay safe, officials advise cooking shellfish thoroughly and avoiding swimming with open cuts in at-risk areas during summer heatwaves, when conditions are most favorable for bacterial growth.</p>

          <p>Amid conservative criticism of the new Superman film's immigrant narrative, this analysis delves into the character's progressive origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was portrayed as a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses, demolished slums, and acted as a socialist figure. This early version of the character stands in stark contrast to the patriotic, establishment figure he later became. The article argues that Superman's identity has always evolved to reflect the times, from a post-war family man to a 1980s yuppie, making his role as a timeless, adaptable metaphor his most enduring quality.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has accused some local council officials of deliberately obstructing the work of his party's newly elected councillors. After gaining control of 10 councils in May, Farage claims his representatives are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies that are resistant to change. He defended controversial spending, such as hiring political assistants in Warwickshire, as necessary to overcome this obstructionism and implement the party's agenda of cutting wasteful spending. Critics, however, have pointed to such hires and increased mayoral allowances as examples of extravagant spending, contrary to Reform's cost-cutting promises.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park, initially allowed to burn under a "control and contain" strategy, exploded in size and destroyed over 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim. The Dragon Bravo fire, sparked by lightning, grew tenfold in a day after weather conditions shifted unexpectedly. This tragic outcome has led to scrutiny of the National Park Service's decision not to extinguish the blaze immediately. Firefighters on the scene reported being underequipped and trapped by the rapidly advancing flames, while officials defended their handling of the incident, stating that hundreds of lives were saved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that in order to effectively combat Donald Trump's political influence, his opponents must learn from his strategic successes. The author suggests that pro-democracy forces have been too focused on denunciation and should instead adopt Trump's methods of telling simple, repetitive stories, showing unwavering determination, and building a grassroots movement outside of traditional party structures. The piece contends that success requires offering a compelling vision for constitutional reform, rather than just defending the status quo. It calls for a more aggressive, less conventional political strategy to match the one that has proven so effective for Trump.</p>

          <p>Scientists across the United States are describing the Trump administration's deep cuts to federal research funding as a "disaster," with major programs in climate science, public health, and basic research being terminated. The cuts have led to significant layoffs at agencies like NASA and NOAA, threatening the loss of vital data and a generation of scientific talent. Many researchers report having their grants canceled midway through studies, forcing them to abandon promising work and consider leaving the country or the field entirely. The "brain drain" is already being felt, as other nations actively recruit top US-based scientists.</p>

          <p>Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, known for documenting ICE raids in the Atlanta area, remains in detention and faces deportation, even after local prosecutors dropped all charges against him. Guevara was arrested in June while livestreaming a protest, and his case has drawn condemnation from press freedom advocates who believe he was targeted for his work. Despite having a work permit and a pending green card application, he has been moved between multiple detention centers. His lawyers and supporters argue his case represents an abuse of power and an attempt to silence reporting on immigration enforcement.</p>
