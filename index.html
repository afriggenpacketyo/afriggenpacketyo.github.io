          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is dropping his bid for reelection, a decision that follows months of speculation and consistently low poll numbers. His withdrawal reshapes the race, creating a three-way contest between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' first term was marked by a series of challenges, including a corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, which contributed to his declining support.</p>

          <p>At the Labour party conference, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has continued his critique of Keir Starmer's leadership, warning that the party is in "peril" and must not underestimate the threat posed by Reform UK. Burnham called for an open debate about the party's direction and strategy to connect more effectively with voters ahead of next year's local elections. His comments have created friction within the party, with some MPs viewing them as a precursor to a future leadership challenge.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police arrested several individuals at a protest in Liverpool supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed by the government under the Terrorism Act. Demonstrators gathered outside the Labour party conference, holding signs with messages such as "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," risking arrest for showing support for a banned organization. The protest highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the group's proscription, which supporters argue infringes on the right to free speech and protest.</p>

Signs of continued weakness in the job market could strengthen the case for more rate cuts this year, while robust data might lead the central bank to pause its easing cycle. Additionally, the recent increase in long-term Treasury bond yields remains a critical factor, influencing borrowing costs across the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Starmer argued that such a move would target people who are lawfully living and working in the country, which he believes would "rip this country apart." While calling out the policy, he also acknowledged that many voters are drawn to Reform out of frustration with years of government failure, not because they are racist.</p>
