          <p>The European Commission has proposed a binding target for the EU to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. This goal is intended to provide certainty for investors and enhance Europe's energy security while keeping the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero target. However, the proposal faces resistance from some member states who find it too ambitious. A controversial clause allowing the purchase of international carbon credits to offset emissions has also drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups, who argue it undermines domestic climate action.</p>

White House meetings are being held with various GOP members, including the pragmatic "Main Street Caucus," to shore up support for the bill, which is a key part of Trump's second-term agenda. To address concerns over proposed Medicaid cuts, Dr. Mehmet Oz has been involved in discussions, advising lawmakers to scrutinize hospital finances.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in the 2022 slayings of four University of Idaho students. As part of a plea agreement, Kohberger will avoid the death penalty and instead receive four consecutive life sentences. During the hearing, he admitted to killing Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin, showing little emotion. The plea has divided the victims' families, with some expressing relief while others, like the Goncalves family, criticized the deal for not requiring a full confession.</p>

          <p>A jury has found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transportation for the purpose of prostitution under the Mann Act, involving his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another woman. However, he was acquitted of the most serious charge, racketeering conspiracy, as well as two sex trafficking charges. The prosecution successfully argued that Combs transported the women for illegal sex acts, but failed to convince the jury that he ran a coordinated criminal enterprise. Combs now faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each of the two convictions.</p>

          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie secured a place in the third round of Wimbledon with a hard-fought victory over American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe. After dropping the first set, the former British number one rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 in a thrilling match on Court One. This performance marks a significant win for Norrie, who has seen his world ranking drop from a career-high of eighth to 61st due to injury and inconsistent form. The victory provides a boost for British tennis, although compatriot Katie Boulter was unexpectedly knocked out in her second-round match.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction, legal teams for Sean Combs and the prosecution are presenting conflicting arguments regarding his potential prison sentence. Prosecutors suggest federal guidelines point to a sentence of about four to five years, while the defense argues for approximately two years. The defense has also requested Combs be released on a $1 million bond until sentencing, citing his acquittal on the most serious charges. Conversely, prosecutors are urging the judge to keep him detained, arguing he remains a flight risk and a danger to the community, citing trial evidence of a long pattern of abuse.</p>

Critics, including journalism organizations and a Democratic FCC commissioner, have labeled the move a "shameful capitulation" that undermines press freedom and could embolden further legal attacks on news outlets.

The expedition, organized by Purdue University where Earhart taught, will travel to the island in November to investigate the site. This development, 88 years after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared, offers what some researchers call the best opportunity yet to solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has affirmed its full support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves after she appeared visibly emotional and tearful in the House of Commons. The incident occurred during Prime Minister's Questions, where the opposition leader questioned her future in the role following a major government U-turn on welfare reform. A spokesperson for Reeves stated she was dealing with a "personal matter," a point reiterated by Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Despite the show of support, the scenes in parliament coincided with a drop in the pound's value and a rise in government borrowing costs, unsettling financial markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," a major legislative package of tax cuts and spending changes, is eliciting mixed reactions from his own supporters. Some voters praise the measure for its proposed fiscal responsibility and focus on "Americans first," viewing the deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and food assistance as necessary. However, other Trump supporters have expressed strong opposition, calling the bill a "scam" that harms working people and cuts essential programs for the poor while increasing the national debt. This division highlights the complex and sometimes contradictory views within the president's base regarding his economic policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae can devastate livestock, wildlife, and even humans. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method, successfully used decades ago, is being revived to create a buffer against the pest's recent migration northward from Central America.</p>

          <p>For savers considering depositing a significant amount, like $10,000, into a certificate of deposit (CD), it is crucial to ask several key questions first. With the current economic landscape of falling interest rates, savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is more beneficial, as short-term accounts currently offer higher rates. It's also important to assess one's ability to keep the funds locked for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, one should compare CDs to liquid alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, which offer comparable rates and greater flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

The closure immediately damages the cardholder's credit score by increasing their credit utilization ratio and adding a significant negative mark to their report.

          <p>For the first time, scientists have successfully sequenced the entire genome of an ancient Egyptian, revealing new insights into the region's ancestral history. The DNA, extracted from a man who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago, is the oldest yet recovered from Egypt. The analysis showed that while 80% of his genetic material originated from North Africa, a significant 20% traced back to people from West Asia, including Mesopotamia. This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections and movement of people between ancient Egypt and societies in the Fertile Crescent.</p>
