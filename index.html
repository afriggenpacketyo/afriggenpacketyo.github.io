          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell has been sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and attempting to murder her niece's ex-husband. This sentencing concludes a lengthy legal saga that also saw her convicted in Idaho for murdering her two children, whom she and her husband believed were zombies. Prosecutors argued the motives were financial gain and her desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, framing the crimes around their "twisted" religious beliefs. The judge described her actions as showing a "blatant disregard for humanity" and leaving a "wake of destruction."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is releasing approximately $6 billion in federal education funding that it had previously frozen for review. The funds, which support programs for English language learners, teacher development, and adult education, were paused to investigate if they were used to promote a "radical leftwing agenda." Advocacy groups and several Republican senators had criticized the delay and pressured the administration to release the congressionally authorized money. While the release is seen as a victory for public education, some groups remain concerned about potential cuts in the fiscal year 2026 budget.</p>

          <p>A Royal Caribbean crew member died after jumping overboard from a cruise ship near the Bahamas on Thursday night.

The woman was reported to be in stable condition after suffering stab wounds to her upper body. The man was later found unresponsive and pronounced dead by the ship's medical staff, and the incident remains under investigation by Royal Bahamas Police.</p>

          <p>Democratic state legislators from Texas are traveling to California and Illinois to meet with Governors Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker, seeking outside support in their fight against a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional districts. Texas Republicans, at the behest of President Trump, are using a special session to push for a new map that could add up to five GOP seats in the U.S. House. Democrats are protesting the move, arguing the focus should be on flood recovery, but have little power to stop the process within Texas.</p>

The Trump administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected.

The narrator comically misinterprets events, such as believing the "Lolita Express" was a flying literary club, and portrays his involvement as part of an elaborate, confusing conspiracy he never quite understood.

          <p>Arriving in Scotland, President Trump deflected questions regarding his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, calling the controversy "not a big thing." His visit, intended for trade talks and promoting his golf courses, has been overshadowed by new reports about his ties to Epstein and the Justice Department's ongoing interview with Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump also addressed the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, stating it was "no time to be talking about pardons" but confirming he had the power to do so. The trip proceeds amid mounting pressure over the administration's handling of the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>In response to images of masked federal agents conducting immigration arrests, Democratic lawmakers in Congress and at the state level are proposing legislation to prohibit the practice. Bills like the "No Secret Police Act" aim to bar federal agents from concealing their faces with non-tactical masks, arguing it is intimidating and undemocratic. While federal action is unlikely with a Republican majority, a California bill is advancing that would apply to all law enforcement. Police advocacy groups oppose the measures, citing officer safety concerns like doxing and the need for protective equipment.</p>

Palantir's U.S. government revenue saw a 45% increase in the last quarter, reflecting its strong position in the defense and intelligence sectors. Despite its high valuation, the company's revenue is significantly smaller than other firms in the top 20. (not investment advice)</p>

His comments came after Canadian officials indicated they would not be rushed into an unfavorable agreement. The Trump administration has threatened a 35% tax on Canadian goods if no deal is reached, adding to existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and vehicles. The ongoing negotiations are critical for Canada, as three-quarters of its exports go to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has acknowledged that the NHS in England faces a challenging period during a five-day strike by resident doctors. The walkout began after talks over pay between the government and the British Medical Association (BMA) failed. While the NHS aims to minimize disruption by keeping non-urgent services running, the BMA has warned of thinly stretched staff and has begun granting some exemptions for doctors to return to work in high-pressure units. This is the 12th strike by resident doctors since March 2023 in their ongoing dispute over pay restoration.</p>
