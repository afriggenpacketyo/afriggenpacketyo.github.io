          <p>Economists are expressing mixed views on Sanae Takaichi, who is poised to become Japan's next prime minister. Her proposed expansionary fiscal policies are seen as a potential driver for economic growth, but they also raise significant concerns about increasing the country's already strained budget deficit and national debt. While Takaichi has favored a dovish monetary policy, her election could limit future interest rate hikes, creating a complex outlook for Japan's economy. The analysis suggests a trade-off between short-term stimulus and long-term fiscal stability.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will permanently remain as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service after taking on the role temporarily. The decision, made by President Trump, is unusual as no prior Treasury secretary has simultaneously led the IRS.

This leadership structure aims to maintain stability and operational control at the tax collection agency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed forgiving student debt for borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, a program that had been partially paused since July. Borrowers who have been making payments for 20 to 25 years are now receiving notices of debt cancellation. The pause was initiated to assess payment counts following court actions that blocked the separate SAVE plan. The resumption of IBR discharges provides relief for thousands of long-term borrowers, although advocates note that backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.</p>

Furthermore, fundamental disagreements persist over the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza, with Israel's leadership opposing a role for the Palestinian Authority.

          <p>France's government has collapsed after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned less than a day after appointing his cabinet, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. The resignation plunges the country deeper into political paralysis, which began after President Emmanuel Macron's party lost its parliamentary majority in snap elections last year. The ongoing instability, amplified by a growing debt crisis, has prompted far-right leader Marine Le Pen to call for the National Assembly to be dissolved and new elections to be held.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned President Trump's order to deploy 400 members of the Texas National Guard to Illinois and other locations. Pritzker stated that he was not consulted or coordinated with on the decision, labeling the move "Trump's Invasion" and an unacceptable use of military troops as "political props." The deployment comes amid clashes between protesters and federal agents in Illinois. The governor called on Texas to withdraw its support for the federal order, highlighting a significant escalation in federal-state tensions.</p>

          <p>Three men have been sentenced to prison for their roles in violent disorder during protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, Essex. The court heard that a peaceful protest descended into serious public disorder where police officers were pushed, punched, kicked, and pelted with projectiles for four hours. Prosecutors stated the men were motivated by hostility towards the asylum seekers after one resident was charged with two sexual assaults. The judge noted that the large-scale disorder caused fear and disruption to the local community and businesses.</p>

          <p>An emergency room doctor has shared her harrowing personal account of fighting the 2024 Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda. The physician, Dr. Tsion Firew, sent her young children to another country for their safety while she treated infected colleagues, many of whom died in the initial days. However, Rwanda's swift, science-based public health response, which included rapid testing and the pioneering use of experimental treatments, resulted in the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak. Her story highlights both the personal sacrifices of healthcare workers and the remarkable success of a well-executed crisis response.</p>

          <p>An economic analysis suggests the U.S. is in a "rolling recession," where different sectors experience downturns at different times, creating a confusing overall picture. While headline GDP figures and a tech-fueled stock market appear strong, key areas like manufacturing, agriculture, and housing have been contracting for months. This sectoral weakness, combined with a rising unemployment rate and high cost of living, contributes to widespread public pessimism. The federal government shutdown is presented as an additional shock that could worsen these regional slumps and threaten the broader economy.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old intensive care nurse in Merseyside had her leg amputated above the knee after what she thought was a muscle injury turned out to be an extremely rare cancerous tumor. Sophie Fay experienced persistent aching and swelling in her right calf, which was initially dismissed as a muscular issue or a cyst. After pushing for further tests, an MRI revealed a large spindle cell sarcoma, leading to the necessary amputation. She is now sharing her story during Bone Cancer Awareness Week to highlight the symptoms and prevent others from experiencing a delayed diagnosis.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine has been awarded to three scientists—Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi—for their groundbreaking discoveries related to peripheral immune tolerance. Their collective work identified a specific subtype of T-cells, known as regulatory T-cells, and the crucial role of the Foxp3 gene in controlling their development. These cells act as a security force to prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. Their research has opened a new field of immunology and is fundamental to developing treatments for autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's ambitious Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program is facing scrutiny after its prototype vessel, the Hai Kun, fell behind its sea trial schedule. The submarine, a centerpiece of the island's efforts to build asymmetric naval capabilities, has spent more time than anticipated in dry dock for maintenance between surface navigation tests. These delays have raised new questions about the future of the critical defense project, which is designed to enhance Taiwan's ability to deter potential military threats. The program's ability to meet its targets for shallow and deep dive trials is now in doubt.</p>

          <p>In his new book "Burned by Billionaires," researcher Chuck Collins argues that the U.S. economic system is purposefully designed to perpetuate wealth inequality. The analysis details how the ultra-wealthy use a sophisticated "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants, along with political influence, to protect and grow their fortunes. Collins describes a final stage of "hyper-extraction," where private equity funds owned by billionaires squeeze profits from essential sectors like healthcare, housing, and pet care. The book contends that this system funnels vast wealth upward while increasing costs and instability for ordinary Americans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to rescind the 'roadless rule,' a two-decade-old regulation that protects 58 million acres of America's most pristine national forests from new roads and logging. The administration argues the rule is an "absurd obstacle" to development and has moved to fast-track its removal to increase timber harvesting. Environmental advocates warn that eliminating the rule will threaten critical ecosystems, endanger drinking water sources for 60 million Americans, and destroy vital carbon stores and wildlife habitats. The move represents a major reversal of long-standing conservation policy.</p>

          <p>A legal analysis in The Atlantic raises concerns that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling on presidential immunity could have damaging consequences for international law. The decision, which grants former presidents absolute immunity for "core constitutional powers," moves American law away from the global trend of holding leaders accountable for international crimes like torture, as established in the Pinochet case. The article argues this could make it harder for the U.S. to advocate for justice abroad and might encourage other countries to adopt similarly broad immunity protections for their own leaders.</p>

          <p>The animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most popular film of all time, ascending to the status of a global cultural phenomenon. Its soundtrack has also achieved historic success, with four songs simultaneously in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10. The article suggests the film's success stems from its authentic immersion in K-pop culture, treating it as a global norm rather than an exotic subculture needing explanation for outsiders. This approach succeeded where previous Hollywood projects failed, resonating deeply with a massive and diverse international audience.</p>
