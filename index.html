          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is beginning to exert a noticeable strain on the economy, with analysts predicting a potential 0.2 percentage point hit to quarterly growth per week, equating to roughly $15 billion. Millions of federal workers, like Michael Galletly from the Department of Agriculture, face missed paychecks, leading to curtailed spending and growing uncertainty in their personal finances. The Trump administration's unprecedented threats of denying backpay and permanent firings, coupled with an already slowing economy, amplify the risks of a prolonged impasse. This article highlights the immediate economic ramifications and the severe financial struggles experienced by federal employees and their families during the shutdown, as they apply for unemployment and seek accommodations from lenders.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 10:12:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration intends to implement price floors across various strategic industries as a measure to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced. Bessent explained that China's global dominance in rare earths, vital for US weapons systems and electric vehicles, has allowed it to slash prices and eliminate foreign competitors over the past two decades. This industrial policy aims to prevent future market distortions, with the US potentially taking equity stakes in companies to ensure self-sufficiency or sufficiency with allies in critical sectors. The article emphasizes the administration's proactive stance in protecting key industries, noting a rally in rare earth and critical mineral miners' shares as investors speculate on future targets.

          <p>Christen Press, a celebrated forward for the US Women's National Team with 155 appearances and a key player in two World Cup victories, has announced her retirement from professional soccer at the end of the 2025 NWSL season. Press, 36, shared the news, expressing a mix of relief, joy, and grief as she concludes a career marked by significant club play in the US and Sweden, and a stint with Manchester United. Her later career was affected by mental health breaks and an ACL injury requiring multiple surgeries, but her comeback with Angel City FC was widely seen as inspiring.

          <p>Hamas has handed over additional remains of Israeli hostages as part of a US-brokered peace deal in Gaza, but the IDF confirmed that one of the four bodies received did not match any of the identified captives. The remains of Staff Sergeant Tamir Nimrodi, Uriel Baruch, and Eitan Levi were identified, bringing the total identified deceased hostages returned to seven. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz criticized Hamas for violating the agreement by not returning all 28 deceased hostages by the Monday deadline.

          <p>Jewish mourning rituals primarily focus on eternal memory among the living, with less emphasis on an afterlife. The article explains that burial, a mitzvah, must occur as quickly as possible, though not on the Sabbath or major holidays. Practices include a ritual bath (Taharah), burial in a simple wooden casket or shroud without worldly belongings, and no public viewing. Mourners observe K'riah, tearing clothing as an expression of pain, and a seven-day shiva period of intense mourning, refraining from work and grooming. The Mourner's Kaddish, an ancient Aramaic prayer, is recited communally to exalt God and honor the deceased's memory.</p>

          <p>Raila Odinga, former Kenyan Prime Minister and a towering figure in the nation's politics, has died at 80 in India following a cardiac arrest. President William Ruto honored Odinga as a "beacon of courage" and "father of our democracy," declaring a seven-day mourning period and a state funeral. Odinga, who ran unsuccessfully for president five times, was instrumental in Kenya's multi-party democracy, often reconciling with incumbent presidents after contentious elections, including a power-sharing agreement following the 2007 post-election violence.

          <p>The Supreme Court is re-examining Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could significantly impact Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The core issue is whether the state's drawing of a second majority-minority district to remedy a potential Section 2 violation unconstitutionally relies on race. Republicans in Louisiana and the Trump administration are urging the court to forbid race consideration in redistricting, potentially weakening the landmark law. Lawyers for Black voters argue that removing Section 2's protections would lead to decreased minority representation and re-segregate legislatures.

While initial tariff concerns were muted by businesses expediting orders, trade uncertainty remains drastically higher than previous years. The article highlights that Australians are notably avoiding US travel, with a 28% drop compared to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a clear judgment on the US political climate. This trend, alongside a forecasted 8.2% fall in international arrivals to the US for 2025, indicates a broader global sentiment that Trump's policies have made the US less attractive.

          <p>A Deloitte survey reveals a pessimistic outlook among most US consumers ahead of the holiday shopping season, with 57% expecting a weaker economy—the most negative sentiment since 1997. Seventy-seven percent anticipate higher holiday prices, partly attributed to President Trump's recent tariffs. Consequently, consumers plan to spend 10% less, averaging $1,595, with Gen Z and Millennials significantly cutting budgets due to economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. The article highlights that retailers face a challenging sales period, with value-seeking behaviors on the rise. Consumers are prioritizing deals and reducing spending on non-gift holiday expenses.

These managers act as mentors, offering structured feedback, fostering autonomy, and creating opportunities aligned with individual skills.
