        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty-nine individuals have been apprehended in connection with the recent outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland, with authorities indicating that further arrests are anticipated. The unrest, which resulted in injuries to 64 police officers, commenced after a peaceful demonstration concerning an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, County Antrim, subsequently spreading to other regions. Detectives investigating online posts related to the disorder have charged a 32-year-old man with sending menacing messages and encouraging offences, while a 25-year-old man was arrested in connection with an arson attack at Larne Leisure Centre. The violence has raised concerns among migrant communities, with reports of some feeling unsafe and avoiding certain areas. The unrest highlights underlying issues such as housing and jobs, contributing to anti-migrant sentiment fueled by misinformation on social media.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains in northern West Virginia led to deadly flash flooding, resulting in at least five fatalities, including a young child, and several individuals remain missing as rescue efforts continue. The rapid downpour, with 2.5 to 4 inches of rain falling in approximately 30 minutes, overwhelmed infrastructure and caused significant damage to roads, bridges, and utilities. Emergency responders conducted multiple water rescues, and the governor declared a state of emergency in affected counties. The floods followed similar downpours in San Antonio, Texas, highlighting the increasing risk of extreme weather events. The governor warned residents to stay off the roads and to not underestimate the strength and speed of the floods.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to review a case involving First Choice Womenâ€™s Resource Centers, a Christian nonprofit, and the New Jersey Attorney General. The nonprofit alleges that the state violated its free speech rights when the Attorney General subpoenaed records over concerns that the center might be misleading women about abortion services. The Christian-based center challenged the subpoena in federal court, arguing it infringed upon its First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court will consider whether New Jersey's investigatory demand must first be adjudicated in state court, adding another layer to the ongoing debate surrounding reproductive rights and free speech.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that mortgage rates are unlikely to experience significant fluctuations this summer, remaining stable in the high 6% range unless economic conditions shift dramatically. Three potential scenarios were outlined: rates could remain consistent if economic conditions hold steady, rise if inflation increases or the economy grows too rapidly, or decline if the economy shows signs of cooling. Experts advise prospective homebuyers to focus on controllable variables like rate buydowns and loan programs, rather than attempting to time the market. It's also important to remember that while rates might drop, home prices likely won't, so if a home fits your budget and needs, consult a lender to lock in a rate soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moira Donegan critiques Donald Trump's military parade, arguing it failed to achieve the intended display of power and control. The parade, ostensibly celebrating the US army's 250th anniversary and Trump's 79th birthday, was perceived as an attempt to underscore his authority and suppress dissent. Donegan suggests that the event underscored Trump's desire to imitate a dictator, rather than embody one authentically. The author asserts that the parade was a simulacrum of authoritarianism, ultimately revealing Trump's insecurity and reliance on superficial displays of strength.</p>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead Georgia nurse, has ignited a debate between pro-choice and pro-life factions regarding the ethics of maintaining life support for a pregnant woman without family consent.

While some argue the case highlights the consequences of restrictive abortion laws, others emphasize the value of both Smith's and her baby's lives.

          <p>Global investors appear to be downplaying the potential impact of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, as stock markets remain positive despite ongoing warfare. Some market watchers warn that this complacency could be dangerous, particularly for the energy market. The conflict has already led to increased volatility in energy prices, and further escalation could have significant economic consequences. Some strategists recommend buying into energy assets as a safe haven, while others believe the market is correct in not pricing in a major escalation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin dairy farmer, Adam Faust, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging discrimination against white farmers through USDA programs that favor minorities. The lawsuit, supported by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, claims that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs implemented under the Biden administration continue to disadvantage white farmers. Faust argues that he faces discriminatory fees and loan terms compared to minority and female farmers. The lawsuit contends that these policies violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment.</p>
