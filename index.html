          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing growing concerns about a potential financial crisis due to a bruising price war led by market leader BYD, which has depressed profits for both manufacturers and sellers.

A government-backed industry group has also criticized companies for "dumping" vehicles below the cost of production, reflecting concerns about the sustainability of the price war and its impact on the overall industry. The intense competition and financial strain raise questions about the long-term health and stability of China's EV market (not investment advice).</p>
