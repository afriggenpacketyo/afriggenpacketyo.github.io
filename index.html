          <p>Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions endured a large-scale Russian missile and drone attack overnight, resulting in at least 14 deaths, including three children, and 48 injuries. Ukrainian officials reported significant damage to residential and non-residential buildings, educational institutions, and transport infrastructure across multiple districts, with emergency services working extensively on site. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault as Russia choosing ballistics over diplomacy, urging international partners to impose tougher sanctions and hold Russia accountable. The attack, one of the largest in weeks, also damaged the European Union mission building in Kyiv, prompting strong international reactions and a call for a unified global response.</p>

He cited China's robust ecosystem, which efficiently translates research into industrial applications, facilitates direct engagement with businesses to tackle real-world challenges, and provides easy access to necessary components for building prototypes. Rizal, who joined Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's Entrepreneur College as dean of robotics, envisions the ocean as a crucial future source for drinking water, food, minerals, and power. His move highlights China's growing leadership in deep-sea science and its appeal for advanced technological research and development.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, which resulted in the deaths of two children aged eight and ten and injuries to 17 others, is being investigated by the FBI as an anti-Catholic hate crime and an act of domestic terrorism. The assailant, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene after firing multiple weapons through the church's windows during a morning Mass. Although the specific motive has not been publicly released, investigators discovered a note Westman had scheduled for online publication. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation, including from Pope Leo XIV, and has prompted local officials to caution against misdirected hatred following revelations about the shooter's identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government has proposed modifications to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, aiming to address feedback from the sector. Currently, properties must be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for non-domestic rates. The new proposals suggest allowing an average of 182 days let over several years, alongside counting up to 14 days donated to charity towards this target. While Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford stated the changes reflect listening to businesses, critics argue the adjustments are a "token gesture" that fail to alleviate the ongoing crisis in Welsh tourism, advocating for a significant reduction in the 182-day letting threshold.

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey announced his decision to boycott the upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump's visit, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Davey stated that while declining a royal invitation was difficult, he felt compelled to send a message to Trump, believing the former President holds significant influence to de-escalate the conflict and secure hostage releases. This stance drew sharp criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who labeled it an "appalling judgment" and "pathetic gesture politics." The boycott highlights ongoing international divisions and concerns regarding the dire situation in Gaza, which the UN has described as a "man-made" famine.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe experienced a significant 40% decline in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of reduced registrations, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This downturn occurred even as the overall market for battery electric vehicles in Europe grew. In contrast, Chinese rival BYD saw a remarkable 225% increase in new registrations, aggressively expanding its presence across the continent with competitively priced models. Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to intense competition, an aging product line-up, and potential reputational damage, while Chinese brands collectively achieved a record market share.

          <p>The widespread emotional reaction to Taylor Swift's engagement news has brought attention to the concept of "parasocial relationships," where fans develop strong, one-sided emotional investments in celebrities they don't know personally. Psychologist Sonia Jaeger characterizes these as feeling like "my friend who doesn't know me," a phenomenon amplified by the constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through social media and reality television. While these connections can offer distraction and a sense of community, experts caution that they are not a substitute for genuine, reciprocal friendships. Harvard sociologist Arthur C. Brooks likens such relationships to "fast food," providing temporary satisfaction without fulfilling deeper human needs for connection.</p>

The UK government is currently reviewing these rules, following similar policy changes in the US and EU regarding low-value imports. Critics argue the exemption creates a loophole that disadvantages domestic retailers and potentially exposes consumers to unregulated products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, issued a warning against external interference in the relationship between China and South Korea, asserting that their ties are founded on mutual interests and are not aimed at any third party. This statement comes after South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent assessment that Seoul must rebalance its relationship with Beijing amidst escalating US-China competition. Lee had previously indicated that South Korea could no longer sustain its traditional approach of relying on the US for security while economically cooperating with China, stressing the need to align with America's fundamental policy stance.</p>

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, reported its slowest profit growth in a decade, with net profit increasing by only 2.3% and revenue by 4.2% in the first half of the year. This significant slowdown is attributed to an intensified anti-corruption campaign and a broader economic deceleration, a trend also observed among other major baijiu producers like Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, which reported similar or worse earnings. Baijiu, a traditional Chinese spirit frequently consumed at government banquets and a staple of Chinese culture, has experienced a sharp reduction in consumption in the second quarter due to these policy factors, significantly impacting the industry's financial performance.

          <p>Argentinian authorities are actively searching for an 18th-century Italian portrait, "Portrait of a Lady" by Guiseppe Vittore Ghislandi, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago. The artwork, part of Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker's extensive collection, recently resurfaced in a real estate advertisement for a seaside villa in Argentina, thought to belong to the Nazi officer's descendants. Police conducted a raid on the property, discovering relevant German documents from the 1940s, but the painting itself was not found. This search highlights Argentina's historical role in sheltering Nazis who brought plundered Jewish property.</p>

Medvedev's on-court meltdown, which reportedly began after a photographer walked onto the court, included racket abuse, leading to a $12,500 penalty for obliterating a racket against a chair, alongside a $30,000 fine for general unsportsmanlike conduct. This penalty means the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money. Medvedev had anticipated a significant punishment following the incident.</p>

Austin Butler stars as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life spirals into a violent crime caper after a series of unfortunate events, including a car accident that ended his career and a seemingly simple cat-sitting favor. The article praises Aronofsky's affectionate portrayal of a chaotic New York, populated by a diverse cast of characters, from various criminal factions to a determined NYPD detective. The film delves into themes of squandered potential and the challenges of a protagonist grappling with past glories.</p>

The primary remaining sticking point in negotiations is the game's date, with USC advocating for an earlier season slot to better balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to alter the traditional timing.
