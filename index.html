          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 230,000 pages of previously sealed FBI files concerning the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. This release, which was opposed by King's family, sheds light on the extensive government surveillance and disinformation campaigns targeting the civil rights leader. In a statement, King's children urged the public to view the documents within their full historical context, highlighting the FBI's predatory actions against their father during his lifetime. The files include internal memos and CIA records related to the investigation into his 1968 murder, fulfilling a campaign promise by the president to declassify the documents.</p>

          <p>A severe heat dome is currently affecting over 90 million Americans, with the National Weather Service issuing heat alerts across a wide swath of the country from Nebraska to Florida. Temperatures are expected to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas, with heat index values reaching up to 115 degrees. This extreme weather is intensified by high humidity, particularly in the Corn Belt due to a phenomenon known as "corn sweat." Climate Central analysis indicates that human-caused climate change has made such extreme July heat at least three times more likely for nearly half of the U.S. population, posing significant health risks.</p>

          <h2>Senator Cantwell Urges Trump to Fund Modernized Weather Forecasting Systems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 18:06:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following deadly floods in Central Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is pressing the Trump administration to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting infrastructure, arguing it will save both lives and money. In a letter to the president, Cantwell outlined recommendations including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing aging weather satellites, and investing in supercomputing to improve forecast accuracy. The push comes as the administration plans significant budget cuts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A White House spokesperson responded that the administration is already working to refocus NOAA on its core mission and modernize its technology, moving away from what it terms "climate change activism."</p>

          <p>President Trump's controversial judicial nominee, Emil Bove, is close to securing a position on the federal bench, signaling a potential new direction for the administration's judicial selections. During his first term, Trump heavily relied on the Federalist Society to identify candidates with a conservative, originalist interpretation of the Constitution, successfully appointing numerous judges. Now, as the nominations process resumes, Bove's potential confirmation is being watched as an indicator of the future of the federal judiciary under Trump. This article from NPR explores whether Bove represents a new face for a judiciary aligned with the MAGA movement, moving beyond the traditional conservative legal framework.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic figures, many citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of financial strain and job insecurity. The article highlights the story of an accountant in Chengdu who has not had a raise in five years and now faces potential layoffs, making his dream of homeownership seem unattainable. This personal experience reflects a wider sentiment of a weak job market and an uncertain future for many households and businesses. An expert from the University of Hong Kong notes that the lived experience of the people is a world apart from the rosy economic data presented in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature is meeting in a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move pushed by President Trump's political team to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House for the 2026 midterm elections. This mid-decade redistricting is unusual, as it comes years after the post-2020 Census map was established, under which Republicans hold 25 of 38 seats. The effort has drawn criticism that it is politically motivated to benefit one person rather than Texas's interests. Experts warn that creating more GOP-leaning districts could be legally and politically risky, potentially undermining the voting power of communities of color and creating less secure districts in a rapidly changing state.</p>

Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary, is running as an independent and made the comment at a private event in the Hamptons.

While Snyder stated the bulk of the chain's more than 400 locations will remain in California, her personal relocation and the corporate expansion eastward reflect a broader trend of businesses leaving the Golden State.

Hankison was found guilty of using excessive force by blindly firing shots into Taylor's apartment during the botched raid, though his bullets did not strike her. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who called it an insult to Taylor's life and a dangerous precedent. Taylor's death became a focal point in the national movement against police brutality and racial injustice, sparking widespread protests across the United States.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, including a reduced corporate rate, while also introducing major cuts to Medicaid and the national food stamps program, projected to save $1.1 trillion. The CBO forecasts these cuts will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill will add $4.1 trillion to the deficit when including interest, criticizing the measure for worsening the country's financial situation.

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston court over the decision to strip more than $2 billion in federal research funding from the institution. The administration argues the cuts are a necessary punishment for alleged anti-Jewish bias on campus, while Harvard contends the move is an attempt to control the university's inner workings and will harm vital research. The presiding judge appeared skeptical of the government's claims, questioning how cutting funds for medical research would combat antisemitism and calling the assertion "mind-boggling."

          <p>Pedro Hernandez has been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the 1979 murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, one of America's most influential missing-child cases. At the sentencing, Etan's father, Stan Patz, condemned Hernandez, calling him a monster. Hernandez, a former convenience store clerk, confessed in 2012 to luring Etan into a basement and choking him, but his lawyers maintain his confession was false due to mental illness and have vowed to appeal. The case transformed national awareness of missing children, leading to new police practices, the establishment of a national hotline, and the iconic use of missing children's photos on milk cartons.</p>

          <p>Nearly four decades after 6-year-old Etan Patz vanished on his way to a school bus stop, a jury has convicted former store clerk Pedro Hernandez of his murder. This verdict came after a retrial, as the first trial in 2015 ended with a deadlocked jury. Hernandez confessed to the crime in 2012, but his defense argued the admission was the product of a man with mental illness and a low IQ who could not distinguish reality from fantasy. The prosecution successfully argued that his confession was believable and corroborated by earlier admissions to relatives. Etan's disappearance became a landmark case that changed parenting and law enforcement practices across the U.S.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, has been arrested on arson charges in San Jose, California. Police allege that the 44-year-old intentionally drove a car into a post office early Sunday morning, causing the lobby area to catch fire. No injuries were reported in the incident. In a statement, another brother, Kevin Tillman, confirmed the arrest and revealed that Richard has been battling severe mental health issues for many years. He noted that securing proper care for his brother has proven impossible, and as a result, the incident was not as shocking as it should have been.</p>

          <p>A fragile truce is holding in southern Syria after a week of deadly sectarian clashes between Druze militiamen and Sunni Muslim tribes threatened to destabilize the country's new government. The fighting in Sweida province displaced over 128,000 people and drew in Syrian government forces and unprecedented Israeli airstrikes, resulting in hundreds of deaths. This violence highlights the immense challenges facing President Ahmad al-Sharaa, whose government has struggled to disarm militias and earn the trust of minority communities since ousting Bashar Assad.

          <p>In a new interview, Hunter Biden stated that his father, former President Joe Biden, had been taking the prescription sleeping pill Ambien before his first presidential debate against Donald Trump. He claimed the medication, combined with fatigue from international travel, contributed to his father's widely criticized performance, where he appeared tired and stumbled over his answers. This is the first time anyone close to the former president has publicly mentioned Ambien in connection with the debate. The remarks are likely to fuel a Republican-led House investigation into Biden's mental acuity during his final year in office, from which key administration officials have already declined to testify.</p>

          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC at 8.27% and a home equity loan at 8.28%. This results in almost the same monthly payment for a 10- or 15-year term. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed. Borrowers should consider this variability, as even a small rate increase could raise monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is intended to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants with failed asylum claims or criminal convictions. While Germany does not formally recognize the Taliban government due to its human rights record, it maintains "technical contacts" to handle deportations. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the United Nations, which maintains that conditions in Afghanistan are not yet suitable for returns.

While short-term CDs currently offer high interest rates around 4.50%, providing protection against market volatility, savers may earn more over time with a long-term CD despite its lower rate. The analysis also points out that the most competitive CD rates are typically offered by online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional, local institution. Given the penalties for early withdrawal, it is crucial for investors to carefully compare options before committing a large sum. (not investment advice)</p>

At a 1998 Berkshire Hathaway meeting, Munger stated he believed buying a house was primarily a need for married couples, famously quipping, "The single people, I don't care if they ever get a house." He framed homeownership as a decision of utility, suggesting it should be pursued when one's life circumstances, particularly family needs, require it. This perspective contrasts with the common view of home buying as a default milestone, offering a pragmatic, if blunt, take that resonates today amid soaring home prices and affordability challenges for many individuals.</p>
