          <p>David Lammy and Stephen Doughty met with Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo to discuss post-Brexit arrangements for the territory ahead of potential negotiations with EU and Spanish ministers in Brussels. Talks on border rules between Spain and Gibraltar have been ongoing since the UK's departure from the EU in 2020, aiming for a lasting, stable relationship that ensures safety and benefits for Gibraltar. While an agreement has not yet been finalized, both sides are working towards resolving key sticking points, particularly concerning border crossings for workers and residents. Public sentiment in Gibraltar remains strongly in favor of maintaining British sovereignty, as demonstrated by the overwhelming rejection of shared sovereignty with Spain in a 2002 referendum.</p>

          <p>Southern Baptist delegates overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution opposing same-sex marriage at their national meeting, calling for the overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that recognize same-sex marriage. The resolution, part of a larger statement on marriage and family, asserts that civil law should align with what the convention considers the divinely created order as stated in the Bible. The resolution also addresses issues such as recognizing the biological reality of male and female, opposing policies that compel people to speak falsehoods about sex and gender, and encouraging Christians to embrace marriage and childbearing. The convention also passed resolutions against pornography and sports betting, reflecting its conservative stance on social issues.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion announced a record-breaking 130 million euros ($148 million) funding round, co-led by Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. The company's CEO, Francesco Sciortino, emphasized the speed of development in the nuclear fusion sector, highlighting the funding's importance for future endeavors. Nuclear fusion, the process powering the sun and stars, holds promise as a clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy source if replicated at an industrial scale.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid growing popularity of soccer in the US, several organizations are launching new leagues, leading to a potential over-saturation of the market. The NWSL is launching a second division, the WPSL plans to launch WPSL Pro, and the USL is planning a Division I men‚Äôs league to rival MLS. While the US market presents a massive opportunity for soccer, it's unlikely the sport can grow this much this quickly. The real benefit of the upstart leagues may be to make the incumbents stronger, as the history of professional sports over the last century or so is a tale of secession, insurrection, absorption, and consolidation.</p>

Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek, stated that the extended AI model development process was due to the need for additional computing resources compared with using Nvidia chips. The company has been barred from purchasing advanced US chips since it was added to the US Entity List in October 2019, causing it to rely on local alternatives. Despite the challenges, iFlytek remains committed to using domestic chips to avoid the risk of losing access to imported technology.</p>

          <p>A California law aimed at reducing greenhouse gases by diverting organic waste from landfills is exacerbating illegal dumping in the Antelope Valley, according to local officials and residents. The law requires residents and businesses to separate organic waste, but the lack of infrastructure and agricultural demand in the Los Angeles area has made disposal more expensive, incentivizing illegal dumping. Residents report numerous rogue dump sites, often containing unprocessed mulch, which threatens the fragile desert ecosystem.

          <p>A demonstration in Anaheim showcased the effectiveness of wildfire defense strategies by comparing two tiny homes, one built to typical standards and the other employing fire-mitigation techniques. The unprotected home was quickly engulfed in flames, while the fire-prepared home, featuring a perimeter of cement pavers and fire-resistant materials, remained unscathed. The demonstration emphasized the importance of defensible space, particularly Zone 0 (the first five feet surrounding a structure), and the use of fire-resistant materials. The event served as a lesson for communities rebuilding after wildfires, highlighting the need for modern fire-prevention strategies to protect homes and neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>An article contrasts President Trump's negative characterization of downtown Los Angeles as a "failed third world nation" with the reality of a vibrant, diverse immigrant community. The piece highlights the efforts of immigrants to clean up after protests and maintain their neighborhoods, emphasizing their hard work and contributions to the city. It also recounts the history of Little Tokyo and Boyle Heights as welcoming enclaves for immigrants from various backgrounds, fostering a sense of community and resilience. The article argues that Trump's rhetoric ignores the positive aspects of immigrant communities and their integral role in the city's identity.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are increasingly upgrading their homes to withstand disasters like hurricanes and wildfires in order to save on insurance premiums. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's FORTIFIED Roof standard, to incentivize homeowners to make their houses more resistant to extreme weather events. While these programs offer discounts, they may not address the growing concern of homeowners losing insurance altogether as premiums rise with the increasing cost of extreme weather disasters. Experts emphasize the importance of community-wide retrofitting and insurance companies accounting for these improvements when deciding whether to offer coverage.</p>

          <p>Potential changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" could impact millions of people's health coverage, including enrollment processes, paperwork, and premiums. The bill, combined with proposed regulations and the potential expiration of COVID-19 pandemic-era subsidies, could lead to millions losing coverage by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Key changes include ending automatic re-enrollment, requiring documentation for tax credits, shortening the open enrollment period, and allowing enhanced tax credits to expire. Critics fear these policies will increase the uninsured population and destabilize the ACA marketplaces.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew in the downtown area following escalating protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which have resulted in property damage and clashes with law enforcement. The curfew, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., spans from the 5 Freeway to the 110 Freeway and from the 10 Freeway to where the 110 and 5 freeways merge. The mayor expects the curfew to last several days to curb disruptive actions, with strict enforcement leading to arrests and prosecutions for violators. The protests began Friday in response to immigration raids, escalating over the weekend with incidents of violence, theft, and property destruction, prompting increased arrests and the implementation of the curfew. </p>

The loss, the first for an African side against England in 22 attempts, has dampened the mood following Tuchel's appointment after the Euro 2024 final. Some observers note a lack of identity in the team's playing style and question whether Tuchel has shifted the team in a new direction.

Orcel stressed that UniCredit is presently "far away" from a merger bid with Commerzbank and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government.

Wednesday's vote should be a formality because Tusk's coalition has a 12-seat majority in the lower house, the Sejm, and only a simple majority in the presence of half the 460 parliamentarians is required to win. Tusk announced a cabinet reshuffle would take place in July, asking for a vote of confidence because he has the conviction, faith and certainty that we have a mandate to govern, to take full responsibility for what is happening in Poland.</p>
