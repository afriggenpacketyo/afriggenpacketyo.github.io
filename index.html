          <p>Police in the UK have arrested 71 individuals across London, Cardiff, and Manchester for demonstrating support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization. The government's decision to ban the group, which makes membership or support a criminal offense, followed incidents of criminal damage targeting arms companies. Protesters and critics argue the proscription is an authoritarian misuse of anti-terror legislation, while the government maintains the group's actions pose a risk to national security. The arrests occurred during the second weekend of protests against the ban.</p>

          <p>Global superstar Bad Bunny launched his three-month residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with an emotionally charged concert celebrating the island's heritage and folklore. The performance featured a diverse mix of musical styles, from club beats to salsa, and included tracks that address social injustices like gentrification in the U.S. territory. By returning to his roots and focusing on themes of resistance and pride, the artist is reinforcing his connection to his homeland. The show opened with a new, unreleased song, which fans speculate may remain exclusive to the residency.</p>

          <p>The White Sage Fire in Arizona, ignited by lightning, has grown to over 19,000 acres and remains 0% contained, prompting the immediate evacuation of residents and visitors from the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim. High temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions are fueling the blaze, along with a second nearby fire, creating dangerous circumstances for the region. Park officials have successfully evacuated approximately 500 guests and issued an extreme heat warning, advising against hiking. The conditions have already proven fatal, with a 67-year-old hiker recently dying in the park.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has subtly countered escalating attacks from the Trump administration by publishing a "Frequently Asked Questions" page defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. The move comes after OMB Director Russell Vought criticized the project as an "ostentatious overhaul" and a sign of mismanagement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed's webpage clarifies that costs increased due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and that no "VIP dining rooms" are being built, directly refuting the administration's claims. The project is self-funded by the Fed, not by taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities believe he was responsible for managing large cocaine shipments and controlling trafficking routes from Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador to European markets. The 'ndrangheta is considered one of Italy's most influential and secretive criminal organizations, with a significant global reach in the drug trade.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are seeking a judicial review of UK government policy, arguing for a mandatory ban on smartphones in all English schools to protect children. They contend that the current guidance, which allows individual headteachers to set their own rules, is unlawful and fails to keep children safe from cyberbullying and harmful online content. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, warning of their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a baffling detail: both of the jet's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff, starving the engines of fuel. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they initiated the cut-off, with the other denying they did so. This action, which is typically only performed after landing, led to a total power loss on the Boeing 787, which crashed less than a minute after becoming airborne. Investigators and aviation experts are probing why this happened.</p>

Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the move weakens U.S. diplomacy and national security.

During a virtual court hearing from a high-security prison, he consented to the extradition process.
