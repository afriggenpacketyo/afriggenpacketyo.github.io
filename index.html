          <p>Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service suffered a significant network outage, with over 60,000 user reports logged on the tracking site Downdetector. The company acknowledged the issue and stated it was actively working on a solution. This service disruption occurred just one day after T-Mobile launched its new satellite service powered by Starlink, which is designed to provide mobile connectivity in remote areas without traditional cell tower coverage. The timing of the outage drew considerable attention given the recent expansion announcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines significantly reduced its 2025 profit outlook and provided a third-quarter forecast that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to drop. The airline's CEO attributed the downgrade to weaker domestic consumer demand, stagnant corporate travel, and operational disruptions from storms. While international travel remains strong, domestic revenue metrics have declined, prompting the carrier to scale back its capacity growth plans. This revision follows similar forecast reductions from competitors, signaling broader challenges in the U.S. airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged, positioning it as the newest company to be targeted by meme stock traders. The rally appears to be driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who are attracted to the stock's high short interest. This phenomenon, which can cause volatile price swings as short-sellers cover their positions, has recently affected other brands. The renewed interest in American Eagle coincides with the launch of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, focusing on the brand's denim line. (not investment advice)</p>

Council leaders expressed concern that peaceful protests were being infiltrated by political extremists, turning the local issue into a battleground for wider agendas.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited the Federal Reserve headquarters, publicly clashing with Chairman Jerome Powell over the cost of the institution's building renovations. Trump has been a vocal critic of Powell, pressuring him to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and reduce federal debt payments. The visit, described as unprecedented, highlights the ongoing tension between the administration and the central bank. Trump has used the renovation costs, which he claims are excessive, as another point of attack against Powell's leadership and the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has struck down California's law requiring background checks for ammunition purchases, ruling that it violates the Second Amendment. The court's majority opinion stated the law unconstitutionally constrains the right to keep and bear arms by creating a significant burden on law-abiding gun owners. The decision leans heavily on the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that requires gun control laws to be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a $221 million settlement with the Trump administration to resolve investigations into alleged discrimination against Jewish students. The deal, which also lifts the threat of major federal funding cuts, includes several concessions from the university. Columbia has pledged to hire new faculty for its Israel and Jewish Studies institute and install a vice provost to ensure "balanced" academic programs. While the university claims the deal protects academic freedom, critics argue it sets a dangerous precedent for government intervention in campus ideology.</p>

          <p>A media investigation has uncovered numerous cases where Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) systems used by law enforcement have led to wrongful stops, some at gunpoint. These errors can stem from misread plates by the AI software or from incorrect data in law enforcement databases. While police departments praise the technology as an efficient crime-fighting tool, the consequences of its failures can be severe for innocent citizens. The report highlights a lack of federal regulation and raises significant privacy and civil rights concerns about this powerful surveillance technology.</p>

          <p>A viral claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent Coldplay concert kiss cam incident has been found to be false.

While the show is famous for its seemingly prescient jokes about future events, many supposed predictions are misattributed or fabricated.

The film, which also stars Logan Lerman, follows a couple whose relationship is tested in an extreme way.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formed a "strike force" to investigate allegations that the Obama administration manipulated intelligence related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. The move follows the declassification of documents by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, who claims they show a "coup" against Donald Trump. This action is seen by many as a politically motivated effort by the Trump administration to target its predecessors and distract from current scandals. Any potential prosecution of a former president faces high legal hurdles, including presidential immunity.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have pulled their negotiating teams from Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, signaling a major setback in efforts to end the conflict. A US special envoy stated the decision was made after Hamas's latest response showed a "lack of desire" to reach an agreement, accusing the group of not acting in good faith. An Israeli official also criticized Hamas's approach but insisted the talks had not completely collapsed. The breakdown in negotiations comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with aid organizations warning of mass starvation.</p>

          <p>This article traces the cyclical popularity of facial hair in Western culture, from its widespread acceptance in the post-Civil War era to its decline in the clean-shaven 20th century. Beards and mustaches were once associated with presidents but later became symbols of counter-culture or specific professions. The piece notes the "cringe-ification" of the mustache during the 2010s hipster trend, followed by its current resurgence as a common accessory for men, including prominent politicians. The author reflects on this history through their own personal journey with growing and shaving facial hair.</p>

After signing the initial law, Zelensky has now backed down, promising a new draft that will ensure the independence of these crucial institutions. He discussed the revised legislation with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, inviting German expertise to help review the new bill.</p>
