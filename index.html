          <p>The British government is set to announce significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill to prevent a large-scale rebellion from Labour MPs. According to reports, the changes will protect existing recipients of disability and sickness benefits, with planned cuts now only affecting future claimants. This move represents a major climbdown for the Prime Minister, who faced the possibility of a parliamentary defeat on the flagship legislation. The deal was reached after intense negotiations to secure enough support for the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Republicans have issued a subpoena to Anthony Bernal, a former senior aide to Jill Biden, compelling him to testify in their investigation into President Joe Biden's mental fitness.

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai is facing harsh criticism from opposition lawmakers following a speech in which he compared the nation's democratic progress to forging steel by removing all "impurities." Critics condemned the remarks as a veiled threat to purge political dissent and push for the recall of opposition legislators. One opponent likened the rhetoric to the extreme ideological purity seen in North Korea, urging citizens to reject what they termed a move towards dictatorship. The speech has intensified political tensions within the self-governing island.</p>

          <p>Profits for China's industrial firms fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant monthly drop since last October. This decline is a key indicator of the financial health of the country's manufacturing sector and suggests that Beijing's economic stimulus measures are not yet fully effective. The data presents a mixed economic picture, as strong retail sales contrast with weaker-than-expected industrial output. Economists suggest this could reduce the urgency for further large-scale stimulus from the government. (not investment advice)</p>

The team sees the 6-foot-8 Thiero as a highly athletic wing player who can add defensive versatility. This move addresses the team's need for athleticism alongside its star players.</p>

          <p>A man who performed in the Super Bowl halftime show has been arrested for disrupting the performance by displaying a flag with the message "Sudan and Free Gaza." According to police, the performer, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, deviated from his assigned role and ran across the field with the flag, refusing to comply with security's commands to stop. He was authorized to be on the field as a performer but was not permitted to display the protest flag. He later surrendered to police and faces charges of resisting an officer and disturbing the peace.</p>

          <p>An audit by the International Assn. of Fire Fighters has flagged more than $212,000 in credit card expenses by the former president of the Los Angeles firefighters' union, Freddy Escobar, that were not properly documented. This follows an initial report that led to the suspension of Escobar and other union officials. Auditors concluded that even with new materials provided by Escobar, the vast majority of his transactions lacked the required receipts and business purpose. The parent union has appointed a conservator to oversee the local chapter and restore financial accountability.</p>
