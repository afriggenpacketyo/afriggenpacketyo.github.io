          <p>Palestinian gunmen killed six people and wounded several others in an attack at a bus stop in north Jerusalem. The two assailants were neutralized by a security officer and a civilian at the scene. The incident is one of the deadliest since the latest conflict began, drawing condemnation from Israeli leaders who described it as a brutal act of terror. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a natural response to the occupation's actions, further escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK's new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has stated that the government may suspend visas for countries that do not cooperate with deals to return their own citizens who have no right to be in the UK. This policy consideration was discussed during a Five Eyes intelligence group meeting, which included Donald Trump's head of homeland security. The announcement comes as the UK faces mounting pressure to address the rising number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, a figure that has surpassed 30,000 this year.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between protesters and security forces in Nepal have resulted in at least 13 deaths and numerous injuries. The demonstrations erupted after the government banned 26 social media platforms, including Facebook and X, for failing to register with the communication ministry. While the government claims the ban is necessary to combat fake news and hate speech, thousands of young protesters, describing themselves as Generation Z, gathered near parliament to oppose what they see as an authoritarian measure. A curfew has been imposed in parts of Kathmandu to quell the unrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a prolonged slump, shifting the power dynamic from sellers to buyers due to a shortage of affordable homes and economic uncertainty. Homeowners in some regions, particularly the South and West, are increasingly forced to lower prices and offer concessions to attract buyers. Despite a slight rise in the national median listing price, many metro areas have seen declines, and sales of previously owned homes remain significantly below last year's levels. High mortgage rates continue to be a primary factor, pricing many potential buyers out of the market entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation after his ruling coalition lost its majority in both houses of parliament, creating significant political uncertainty. Ishiba, who was in office for less than a year, will remain until the Liberal Democratic Party elects a new leader in early October. His departure raises concerns about political stagnation as Japan confronts major domestic challenges like a cost-of-living crisis and growing national security threats. The upcoming leadership race is expected to be contentious, with potential candidates like Sanae Takaichi and Shinjiro Koizumi representing different factions within the party.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the team for the first Ashes Test against Australia, starting November 21, has not yet been finalized. A key position in question is the number three batter, with a choice between vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old newcomer Jacob Bethell. Bethell has shown promising form recently but will have further opportunities to make his case in upcoming T20 and ODI matches. McCullum emphasized the need for players to rest and freshen up before the demanding winter schedule, highlighting the grueling nature of the current cricket calendar.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense back to its original "Department of War" is a truthful, if alarming, reflection of his administration's aggressive foreign policy. The author contends that the Pentagon has long functioned as a department of war, citing numerous undeclared conflicts and military interventions since World War II. The piece criticizes Trump's actions in Syria, Yemen, and Iran, and his proposed $1 trillion defense budget, suggesting the name change is not just symbolic but embodies a dangerous "warrior ethos" that prioritizes conflict over peace and diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing divide in U.S. union membership, with states that protect collective bargaining rights seeing an increase in members while "right-to-work" states experience significant declines. In 2024, pro-union states added nearly 10,000 members, whereas right-to-work states lost 200,000. The analysis highlights that workers in right-to-work states earn about 7% less and face higher rates of discrimination. The findings suggest that state-level policies play a crucial role in the health of the labor movement and overall economic outcomes for workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists argue that the recent slowdown in the U.S. job market is more attributable to general economic uncertainty than to AI-driven job replacement. Experts note that while some tech companies have announced AI-related layoffs, the broader impact remains small, with the tech industry comprising a relatively minor portion of the overall workforce. Instead, businesses are being conservative with hiring due to unpredictable economic policies. The article suggests that workers should focus on acquiring AI skills, as demand for them is growing, and AI is more likely to augment rather than eliminate many jobs.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critically examines the "Abundance" movement, a center-left political agenda focused on progress in housing, infrastructure, and energy, arguing it is doomed to fail. The author contends that the movement cannot reconcile its goals with the more radical, anti-capitalist factions of the left it needs to win elections, who often view the movement's proponents with hostility. The article suggests that true progress on large-scale projects requires centralized authority and trade-offs that conflict with the far-left's emphasis on democratic process and material equality. It concludes that the movement is either hopelessly naive or a clever rebranding for socialist policies.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts Donald Trump's strategy of deploying federal troops to combat urban crime with the approaches favored by city leaders, who advocate for community-based violence intervention programs. While Trump has declared his federal surge in Washington, D.C., a success and plans to expand it, cities like Baltimore are seeing record-low murder rates through targeted rehabilitation and enforcement efforts. Local leaders argue that Trump's methods are reminiscent of failed "tough-on-crime" policies from the past and that sustainable crime reduction requires addressing root causes.

While tech giants are investing, the sector faces hurdles such as vast capital requirements, long construction times, and uncertain political and regulatory landscapes. The development of small modular reactors (SMRs) offers a more scalable solution but most are not expected to be commercially viable until 2030. Financial institutions are now more open to financing nuclear projects, but government support is still seen as essential to mitigate the substantial risks involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party's ruling body is meeting to establish the rules and timetable for a deputy leadership election after Angela Rayner resigned last week over an underpaid stamp duty scandal. The contest is anticipated to be a significant event, potentially shaping the future direction of the party. Potential candidates include Dame Emily Thornberry and Louise Haigh, with figures like Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calling for a voice from the north of England to balance the party's leadership. Rayner's departure prompted a major cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Private equity firms are intensifying their recruitment of fundraising and investor relations talent, often poaching from investment banks, as securing capital becomes more challenging. After a slowdown in dealmaking, firms are now investing heavily in distribution teams to attract funds from limited partners like pension funds and family offices. This hiring spree has led to a "talent war," with large firms offering significant compensation to secure top performers. In response, investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have implemented stricter rules to prevent their junior analysts from being recruited away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump is fundamentally unqualified for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing numerous actions that have fostered conflict and suffering. The author points to the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which could lead to millions of preventable deaths, and Trump's support for conflicts in the Middle East. The article also criticizes Trump's alleged pressure on world leaders for nominations and his threats of military action against allies like Canada and Denmark. It concludes that Trump's presidency embodies war, famine, and disease, making him the antithesis of a peace prize laureate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The legality of President Donald Trump's extensive trade tariffs is heading to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court ruled he had overstepped his presidential authority. The administration has relied on the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the levies, but courts have questioned whether the law grants the power to set tariffs. The case represents a major legal test of Trump's trade strategy, with the administration arguing a loss would "destroy" the U.S. economy. Legal experts are divided, noting the conservative-leaning court could either support broad executive power or push back against what some see as presidential overreach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The release of records from Jeffrey Epstein's estate to a House committee this week could provide new information about the late sex trafficker's network of powerful associates.

Lawmakers have also requested suspicious activity reports (SARs) from the Treasury Department, which could reveal how high-profile individuals moved money through Epstein's accounts. However, there are concerns that the release may yield little new information, as the Trump administration has been accused of obstructing transparency on the matter.</p>
