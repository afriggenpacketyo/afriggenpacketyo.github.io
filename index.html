          <p>Mike Waltz, former National Security Advisor under President Trump, was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting, raising questions about security protocols. The White House defended Waltz's use of the app, stating it was approved for government phones. This incident followed earlier scrutiny when Waltz inadvertently invited a journalist to a Signal chat discussing a U.S. attack in Yemen. Despite the administration's defense, the Pentagon's watchdog criticized the use of Signal for official business, citing breaches of records retention policies. Trump subsequently nominated Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, arguing it violates double jeopardy laws. The defense claims that Mangione is facing concurrent state and federal prosecutions in New York, as well as separate charges in Pennsylvania, infringing on his constitutional rights. They also seek to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not given Miranda warnings. The attorneys further challenge the terrorism upgrade to the charges, arguing a lack of evidence that Mangione intended to intimidate a civilian population.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism for changes to maternity funding, with campaigners accusing him of "betrayal." Following a report on poor maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, nearly £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety. However, recent changes mean that only £2m of this funding is guaranteed to be spent on maternity care this year. The Royal College of Midwives described the funding decision as taking "a wrecking ball" to maternity safety, fearing that the removal of ringfencing will lead to budget cuts.</p>

These Chinese giants have relied on the "de minimis" exemption to ship low-value items directly to the US without duties or import taxes. The move aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and protect American businesses.

          <p>Apple anticipates a $900 million increase in costs this quarter due to tariffs, despite exemptions on key electronics. To mitigate the impact, Apple is shifting iPhone production for the American market away from China, with the majority of iPhones sold in the US being made in India. Despite the tariff-related challenges, Apple's sales remain strong, with revenues for the first three months of the year rising 5% to $95.4 billion. Amazon, another tech giant, also reported solid sales growth, indicating resilience amidst trade policy disruptions.</p>

This decision follows reports that a backlog of cases in the district attorney’s office contributed to delays in charging Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino, who is now accused of murdering 13-year-old Oscar Omar Hernandez. The new policy requires that the process to file a criminal complaint begin within one business day once a decision has been made to seek an arrest warrant.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has criticized Trump's tariffs as "not the act of a friend" but has committed to not retaliating. Analysts suggest that Trump's actions may be helping Albanese by creating a sense of crisis that voters rally around.</p>
