          <p>In a high-profile Australian case, the jury has retired to consider its verdict for Erin Patterson, a woman accused of murdering three relatives with a meal containing deadly death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors allege she intentionally poisoned her estranged husband's parents and aunt with a beef Wellington dish in July 2023. Patterson has denied all charges, maintaining that the poisoning was a tragic accident and that she lied to police out of fear.</p>
