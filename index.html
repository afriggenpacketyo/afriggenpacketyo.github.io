        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large study in Sweden suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly lower risks for associated negative outcomes. Published in the British Medical Journal, the research found that taking medication was linked to reductions in first-time suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings provide evidence that medication can mitigate impulsive behaviors tied to the disorder, offering important context for patients and doctors weighing the benefits against potential side effects. This information helps fill a gap regarding the risks of not treating ADHD.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's decision to proscribe the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization has led to unprecedented mass arrests and a complex legal showdown. Over 700 supporters, many of them elderly, have been arrested for defying the ban, creating a significant challenge for the justice system. The government justifies the ban by citing millions of pounds in criminal damage, while critics, including the UN human rights chief, argue it infringes on free speech. The group's future now hinges on a High Court challenge that will determine if the ban was a rational and proportionate response.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. restrictions on China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to maintain a competitive edge. Conglomerate HD Hyundai is set to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines with a $550 million investment, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts view this shift as a strategic move to overcome domestic constraints like labor shortages and high costs. This strategy leverages the lower operational expenses in the region, though developing a skilled local workforce will take time.</p>

          <p>The Canadian province of Nova Scotia has implemented a sweeping ban on all activities in wooded areas, including hiking and fishing, to mitigate extreme wildfire risk. Violators of the ban face a hefty C$25,000 fine, a measure officials defend as necessary in a province described as a "tinder box" after a long period without rain. The move has drawn criticism from a civil liberties foundation, which labeled it an example of "creeping authoritarianism." However, many residents support the temporary restrictions as a crucial precaution against human-caused fires.</p>

          <p>New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency for the city of Española and surrounding areas in response to a significant increase in violent crime and drug trafficking. The order authorizes $750,000 in emergency funds to help law enforcement address the crisis in Rio Arriba County, which has the highest overdose death rate in the state. Police calls in the area have more than doubled in the last two years, prompting the governor to take action. This marks the second time this year the governor has declared a crime-related state of emergency in the state.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services, the parent company of the digital payment app Zelle. The suit alleges that the company knowingly failed to implement adequate security safeguards, which allowed fraudsters to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The lawsuit claims that Zelle's design made it uniquely susceptible to scams and that its partner banks violated anti-fraud rules. The legal action seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers and a court order mandating stronger anti-fraud measures.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain on penalties after squandering a 2-0 lead in the final minutes of the match. Despite the heartbreaking collapse, the performance offered promising signs for new manager Thomas Frank, whose pragmatic, set-piece-focused tactical approach was evident for 85 minutes. Both of Tottenham's goals came from dead-ball situations, a hallmark of Frank's previous teams. While the late defensive fragility shows there is work to be done, the display against the European champions suggests a solid foundation is being built.</p>

          <p>Nine years after Canada legalized Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), a feature in The Atlantic explores the program's complex realities and surging demand. The country's system is guided by a strong emphasis on patient autonomy, which means a patient does not have to exhaust all other treatment options to be eligible. This principle creates profound ethical dilemmas for clinicians, who must navigate cases where a patient with a treatable condition requests MAID. The article delves into how individual doctors are grappling with this responsibility and why demand has far outpaced initial predictions.</p>

This was reinforced by the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows for local governance but maintains ultimate federal oversight.

          <p>The fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Erin, has formed off the coast of Africa and is expected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by Friday. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands. While its long-term path remains uncertain, early models project it will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands over the weekend. It does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S., but forecasters are monitoring its development closely.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the U.S., Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel figures to face justice in American courts. Those transferred include Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the "Los Cuinis" organization and brother-in-law of the notorious CJNG leader "El Mencho." This move is the second major extradition of cartel members this year and comes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to intensify its crackdown on the criminal networks responsible for smuggling fentanyl and other drugs across the border.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second-most valuable franchise in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to a new Sportico ranking. This marks a dramatic turnaround for the team, which was ranked last in the league with a valuation of $930 million just a decade ago while in St. Louis. The franchise's soaring value is attributed to its return to Los Angeles and owner Stan Kroenke's investment in the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and surrounding entertainment district.

Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence after being convicted on three felony counts. His legal team sought to introduce a new statement from a security guard, but the petition was rejected by the court.
