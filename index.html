          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals a rise in Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating to 37%, up from 31.7% in May.  The increase is largely attributed to public support for a policy shift to increase domestic rice production.  However, a significant portion of respondents still deem the government's response to rising rice prices as insufficient. The survey also shows public disapproval of the LDP's planned cash handouts.</p>
