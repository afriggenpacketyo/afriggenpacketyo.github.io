          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people, including 15 children, with rescue operations ongoing for dozens still missing. A children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely impacted, with 27 campers remaining unaccounted for after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, and hundreds of personnel are involved in a massive search and rescue effort, which has already saved over 850 people. The sudden and ferocious nature of the flood caught many residents and campers by surprise in the pre-dawn hours.</p>

          <p>An unarmed North Korean man successfully crossed the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and was taken into South Korean custody. This rare event comes as South Korea's liberal government pursues a softer diplomatic stance toward Pyongyang, a policy that has drawn criticism for potentially weakening deterrence. The man was tracked by troops and guided through mine-laced terrain before being detained. Most defectors from North Korea typically choose a less dangerous route through China, making this direct crossing highly unusual and highlighting the persistent tensions on the peninsula.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered two dominant, scoreless innings in his latest pitching appearance, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately lost 6-4 to the Houston Astros. The team's long-relief pitching struggled, allowing five runs and erasing an early lead created by the offense. Despite the loss, the team remains hopeful about its long-term pitching strength, with star pitchers Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell expected to return from injury soon. Ohtani's performance, which included striking out the side in one inning, was a significant positive for the team.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain observed the changes to the landscape and culture. He felt a profound sense of belonging when he was allowed to pilot a steamboat again, reinforcing how his early, unfettered life on the river remained a magical touchstone and a core source of his creative inspiration.</p>

          <p>New regulations for top Communist Party bodies in China suggest a move toward standardizing the policy coordination and review process at the highest levels of government. The rules specify that central commissions and leading groups should focus on major strategic planning and oversight rather than day-to-day execution. Analysts interpret this as a potential sign that President Xi Jinping is delegating more authority to his deputies, a move that could provide hints about future succession planning within the party's leadership structure.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flood in Texas highlights the region's extreme vulnerability, as it is located in an area known as "Flash Flood Alley." This article explains that the area's steep hills and thin soil, which absorbs little water, cause rapid runoff into shallow creeks and rivers, leading to sudden, powerful surges. This unique geography, combined with powerful downpours created when moist Gulf air rises over the Balcones Escarpment, creates one of the most dangerous places for flash flooding in the United States, as tragically demonstrated this week.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20, further shrinking the slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with China. His departure leaves the GOP with a 219-212 majority, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson and his party in passing legislation through the lower chamber.</p>

          <h2>US Policy on Chinese Drones Faces Challenges from Industry Dominance</h2>

          <p>A recent executive order from President Trump signals another attempt by Washington to curb China's dominance in the global drone market. However, industry insiders and analysts note that China's leading position makes it difficult for the U.S. to remove its products from supply chains without significant disruption. With few non-Chinese alternatives available, a potential ban could lead to increased costs and logistical challenges for commercial drone operators who rely on the technology for inspections and other services.

          <h2>Social Security Administration Criticized for Misleading Email Praising Trump's New Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 17:57:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for sending an email that critics call "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The email claimed that President Trump's newly signed spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. In reality, the bill provides a temporary, limited tax deduction for seniors, not a full elimination of taxes, leading former officials to condemn the agency's communication as misleadingly partisan and an erosion of public trust.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared in public for the first time since the 12-day conflict with Israel in June, according to Iranian state media. Footage showed him at a mosque in Tehran ahead of the Shia festival of Ashura, ending speculation about his whereabouts and health during the war. During the conflict, which saw Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages, leading to the unconfirmed rumors.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that pregnant people exposed to high heat and wildfire smoke, especially during the first trimester or even before conception, face a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. Babies were more likely to be smaller in the womb and at birth, with the effects being nearly double for those living in more climate-vulnerable neighborhoods. Doctors and health experts are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks and for pregnant people to take precautions like staying cool and wearing masks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," stating it will give Americans "back your freedom." The billionaire suggested the party could gain significant influence by focusing on a small number of key congressional races, potentially acting as a deciding vote in a narrowly divided legislature. This move follows a public falling out between Musk and President Donald Trump, to whom Musk was previously a major donor and a key ally on government efficiency.</p>
