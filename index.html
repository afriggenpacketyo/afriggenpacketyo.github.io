        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the extent to which lower court judges can block presidential orders nationwide. The justices questioned the solicitor general on the practicality and constitutionality of the order, with concerns raised about potential violations of the 14th Amendment and existing Supreme Court precedents. The court also considered the implications of limiting nationwide injunctions, which could lead to a fragmented system of citizenship across different states. The case tests the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches regarding immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A parents' coalition has launched an ad campaign and called for congressional investigations into Meta's AI chatbot systems, alleging that the company prioritizes engagement metrics over children's safety. The campaign follows reports that Meta's chatbots engaged in sexually explicit conversations, even with users the system knew were underage, and that the company loosened guardrails to make the chatbots more engaging. Meta contends that it has age-appropriate safeguards in place and prohibits sexually explicit conversations with teens, and that it has introduced parental supervision tools. The American Parents Coalition also launched a new website titled "DangersofMeta.com" with links to APC's letter to members of Congress, images of the mobile billboards they are deploying, a link to the new "lookout" notification system, and recent articles about Meta's work pertaining to children's safety.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revisiting its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten cereal flour and improve bread dough, after concerns were raised about its safety.

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka alleges that federal prosecutors attempted to "humiliate and degrade" him by requiring him to be fingerprinted and photographed a second time following a court appearance on a trespassing charge.

Baraka, a vocal critic of Trump's immigration policies, claims he did not violate any laws and was standing up for the Constitution.

          <p>Gold investing has gained traction as a hedge against inflation, but a traditional approach may not be ideal. Experts recommend allocating no more than 10% of your portfolio to gold, but the timing and frequency of investment depend on individual circumstances. Getting invested quickly is generally advisable to avoid price increases, while existing investors might consider a slower approach to rebuilding their gold investment after selling for profit. The key is to build up to the recommended threshold based on personal needs and goals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A group of environmental researchers is calling on Governor Newsom to fund soil testing at homes destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County. The researchers argue that soil sampling is essential to ensure burned-down homes do not contain unsafe levels of toxic substances. This call comes after federal agencies declined to pay for soil testing, raising concerns about potential health risks to returning residents. Local officials are worried about a decline in tax revenue, and federal, state, and local governments could experience tax revenue losses from roughly $730 million to $1.4 billion due to the wildfires, according to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.</p>

The bill includes a new $4,000 deduction for seniors, increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers, and extends the Child Tax Credit. Other provisions would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and allow car loan interest to be deducted. The bill is expected to undergo changes as it moves through the legislative process, with some Democrats opposing cuts to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the tax cuts.</p>

Republicans currently hold 53 seats to Democrats' 45. The seat up for election in Georgia -- held by incumbent Democratic Sen.
