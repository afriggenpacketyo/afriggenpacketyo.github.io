          <p>A federal judge ordered the U.S. government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States by April 7th, 2025.

The Justice Department denied the existence of such a contract, despite statements from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting otherwise.

          <p>The ongoing market sell-off following President Trump's new tariffs is causing divisions within the Republican party.  Some Republican senators are collaborating with Democrats to introduce legislation to increase congressional oversight of tariff policy.  The market turmoil, exacerbated by China's retaliatory tariffs and the Fed's warnings, is prompting calls for greater congressional control over trade policy.  The situation underscores the growing concern over the potential economic consequences of Trump's protectionist policies.</p>
