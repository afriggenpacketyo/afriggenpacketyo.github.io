          <h2>Chinese Satellite Achieves High-Speed Data Transmission with Low-Power Laser</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has reportedly achieved a data transmission speed five times faster than Starlink by using a 2-watt laser from a satellite in stationary orbit. The satellite, positioned 36,000 kilometers above Earth, transmitted data at 1Gbps despite atmospheric turbulence, which typically scatters light. The scientists combined adaptive optics and mode diversity reception to overcome this challenge, marking a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology. This could potentially enable high-definition movie downloads from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds. The advancement highlights China's growing capabilities in space-based communication technologies and its potential to surpass existing systems. The stability of this technology will need to be proven before it can be deployed on a large scale, but the initial results are promising.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while holding the benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5%. The central bank plans to reduce monthly bond purchases by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, aiming for a monthly purchase amount of approximately 2 trillion yen. This adjustment is intended to improve the functioning of the Japanese government bond markets and support market stability.

          <p>Israel reportedly attacked Iranian state television and warned hundreds of thousands of people in Tehran to evacuate, following a wave of Iranian missile strikes that resulted in civilian casualties in Israel. The warning affected a large part of central Tehran, including the state TV headquarters, police headquarters, and several hospitals.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the deployment of additional capabilities to the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility to enhance defensive posture, while the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level. The ongoing conflict has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, raising concerns about further escalation.</p>

The agreement removes tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, preventing significant job losses in the West Midlands. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding the origin of the steel. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, with officials ensuring no changes to UK food safety standards.

          <p>The UCLA versus LSU Men’s College World Series game has been suspended until Tuesday morning due to thunderstorms. Play will resume in the top of the fourth inning with LSU leading 5-3 and UCLA at bat. UCLA had an early lead but LSU responded with a four-run first inning. The suspension allows UCLA to regroup and attempt a comeback, with the remainder of the game set to air on ESPN. The delay is unfortunate, but both teams will have to adjust to the new circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder are one win away from their first NBA championship in 46 years after defeating the Indiana Pacers 120–109 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Jalen Williams scored a playoff-high 40 points, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 31 points and 10 assists. The Thunder held off a late Pacers rally to take a 3-2 series lead. Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton was hobbled by an injury, impacting the Pacers' performance, and the Thunder capitalized on turnovers. The Thunder are now favored to win the title, with Game 6 scheduled for Thursday in Indianapolis.</p>

          <p>China has suggested that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned, based on recent images and state media reports. New satellite images show 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, exceeding the capacity of China’s existing carriers. State media referred to an “era” when the Chinese navy would have three carriers, further fueling speculation. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggested the new markings indicate the Fujian is preparing for commissioning, with potential sea trials and coordination exercises to follow before formal service entry. The commissioning of the Fujian would significantly enhance China's naval capabilities and project power in the region.</p>

The Howe fire has burned approximately 40 acres near Piru, while the Maria fire, which burned about 15 acres near Santa Paula, has been contained. The National Weather Service has warned of increased risk for grass fires due to gusty winds, hot temperatures, and low humidities across Southern California. Temperatures are expected to soar, with potential for red flag warnings in areas including the Grapevine and Santa Ynez Mountains. The current fire weather is a concern for the region and could lead to more fires.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating a fatal shooting at a “No Kings Day” protest, involving two self-described “peacekeepers.” The incident occurred when the peacekeepers confronted 24-year-old Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly pulled out a rifle near the protest. One of the peacekeepers opened fire, killing an innocent bystander, Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo, and wounding Gamboa, who was later arrested. The protest was organized by 50501, a grassroots political group, and police are investigating the legality of the peacekeepers' actions and the presence of organized security at the event. The shooting has prompted strong reactions from state leadership and is raising questions about unauthorized security at public demonstrations.</p>

The summit was also impacted by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, prompting Trump to leave early.

The 25 percent tariff on autos remains a key sticking point, despite Japanese automakers' investments and production in the United States. Trump's tariff policies, aimed at rectifying trade imbalances, have added tension to the alliance, with the outlook for a deal uncertain ahead of Japan's House of Councillors election (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside the existing law. Stella Creasy's amendment will be different, though it is not described in this article, and the main abortion providers are backing the amendment. The vote could result in significant changes to abortion laws.</p>

Common causes of homelessness include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, and medical issues. The trend is putting a strain on healthcare systems, as older homeless individuals often require more complex medical care and have difficulty finding stable housing, which is negatively impacting their health and well-being.</p>

The survey also indicates that nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, equivalent to 210,000 young people. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is calling on the government to prioritize passing the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing of nicotine pouches and their sale to under 18s. While pouches are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.</p>
