          <p>A Labour councillor in the UK, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder. During an anti-racism rally in Walthamstow, Jones had called far-right protesters "Nazi fascists" and made a throat-slitting gesture, which was captured on video. He argued his remarks were "ill-advised" but not intended to incite violence. The jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court deliberated for only half an hour before reaching the not guilty verdict, concluding a contentious case involving political speech and public order.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced a $10 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Juan José Farías Álvarez, the alleged leader of Mexico's United Cartels. This major operation was triggered by a minor car accident in Tennessee involving two drug dealers, which unraveled a vast trafficking network. The investigation highlights how drugs flow from Mexico to American communities and the violent consequences that follow. The indictments also target four other high-ranking cartel members, with multi-million dollar rewards offered for them as well.</p>

          <p>Talks in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark global treaty to combat plastic pollution have concluded without an agreement. Negotiators from 183 countries were unable to resolve key differences, particularly on whether to impose caps on new plastic production. Oil-producing nations and the plastics industry advocated for focusing on waste management and recycling, while around 100 countries pushed for production limits. Despite the disappointment, officials stated the process will continue, though the timeline for a final treaty is now uncertain, marking a setback for environmental efforts.</p>

The piece contends that traditional solutions like universal basic income will be insufficient, and calls for a bold reimagining of government's role in creating meaningful work and purpose.

          <p>President Trump's justification for a federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police and potential interventions in other cities is based on claims of high crime rates that are contradicted by data. Experts and local officials point to FBI data showing a significant nationwide decrease in violent crime since the pandemic peak, a trend consistent across both red and blue cities. Mayors from cities like Chicago and New York have pushed back, highlighting their own public safety improvements and accusing the administration of political theater.

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, their objectives for ending the war in Ukraine appear starkly different, with Ukraine and its European allies watching anxiously. Experts suggest Putin aims to secure a "bad peace" that solidifies Russian territorial gains, discontinues U.S. aid to Ukraine, and drives a wedge between Western allies. Conversely, Ukraine insists on the full withdrawal of Russian troops and the preservation of its territorial integrity, rejecting any "land swapping." The summit is seen as a critical test of Trump's diplomacy, with concerns that Putin may try to manipulate the U.S. president's desire for a quick resolution.</p>

American astronomer Percival Lowell popularized the theory that these were irrigation canals built by an advanced Martian civilization, an idea that captured the public imagination during a time of earthly turmoil.

          <p>A California bill, AB 597, intended to increase transparency and prevent exploitation by public insurance adjusters, is drawing criticism for potentially harming policyholders. The legislation, sponsored by the Department of Insurance, would change how adjusters calculate their fees after a catastrophe, basing them only on funds recovered after they are hired. Opponents, including the consumer group United Policyholders, argue this will force adjusters to charge much higher contingency rates, discouraging fire victims from seeking professional help and potentially reducing their total insurance payout. Major insurance industry groups support the bill, raising further suspicion among its critics. (not investment advice)</p>

This figure is significantly higher than the 10-year average and continues an upward trend from last year's record of nearly 12,500 cases. Health officials attribute the rise to cycles of drought and precipitation, which help the Coccidioides fungus thrive in the soil, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley.

          <p>A retired RAF test pilot, Squadron Leader Robert Burke, has claimed that the 1994 Chinook helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre, which killed 29 people, was a "show flight." He alleges the recently upgraded Mark 2 Chinook was used to transport senior security officials to demonstrate its safety to the Army, despite internal reservations about its airworthiness from pilots and engineers. He called the decision a "reckless act" and a "gesture" to prove the upgrade program was on schedule. This new allegation has renewed calls from victims' families for a new public inquiry into the disaster.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has written to the prime minister demanding that his party be allowed to appoint members to the House of Lords. Farage argues that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," as his party has four MPs and significant voter support but no representation in the Lords. He points out that other parties with fewer votes have multiple peers. Political appointments to the Lords are at the prime minister's discretion, and a Downing Street spokesperson indicated that decisions follow established conventions, making the request a notable political maneuver.</p>

          <p>The German government has strongly criticized Israel's plan to construct 3,400 new housing units in a controversial area of the occupied West Bank. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated the plan violates international law, complicates a negotiated two-state solution, and would effectively divide Palestinian territory. The plan, announced by a far-right Israeli minister, focuses on the sensitive E1 area, which would sever the connection between major Palestinian cities. Germany reiterated its call for Israel to halt all settlement construction and stated it will only recognize border changes agreed upon by both parties.</p>

The conflict has destroyed livelihoods, and the blockade prevents trade and aid from reaching most of the state.

          <p>A research team at Tsinghua University in Beijing has developed a new approach to the "single-source shortest-paths" problem, a fundamental challenge in computer science for over 40 years. Traditional methods like Dijkstra’s algorithm have a speed limit due to a necessary sorting step. The new method reportedly bypasses this sorting process, focusing only on the most critical points in a network to significantly reduce calculation time. The research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, won the Best Paper Award at the prestigious ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, signaling a major potential advancement.</p>

He points to a decline in the U.S. team's medal share at recent championships as evidence of systemic issues and states he would hesitate to let his own children join the current system. Phelps, along with other swimming greats, is calling for an independent review and significant changes to athlete services and grassroots investment. Their concerns are amplified by the approaching 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, which they see as a critical deadline to fix the program.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is facing scrutiny over its fan code of conduct, which bans political displays and has led to recent controversies, including the removal of a fan wearing a MAGA hat and the confiscation of anti-ICE banners. The policy, which prohibits "electioneering, campaigning or advocating for or against any candidate, political party, legislative issue, or government action," is difficult to enforce consistently across its many venues. Critics argue the vague rules are applied unevenly and can stifle expressions of human rights, highlighting the league's struggle to balance global soccer culture with American professional sports norms.</p>

The new voting map, pushed by the Trump administration to create more Republican-held seats in Texas, would move the neighborhood from its current Democratic district into a new, heavily Republican one. Community activists worry that their concerns, such as air pollution and fears over immigration enforcement, will be ignored by a representative catering to wealthier, suburban voters.

          <p>During the August congressional recess, Republican representatives holding town halls are facing tough questions from constituents about President Trump's signature legislative package. To manage these interactions, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) provided lawmakers with a memo of talking points, advising them to focus on popular provisions like tax cuts on tips. An NPR review of several town halls shows that lawmakers are closely following this script, often deflecting critical questions about healthcare cuts and tax benefits for the wealthy by pivoting to these pre-approved messages. Many Republican members have opted to avoid in-person town halls altogether.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has suggested he might deploy federal forces to other cities like Los Angeles or Chicago, legal experts argue that such an action would be much more difficult than the recent takeover in Washington, D.C. The president has unique authority over the nation's capital under the Home Rule Act, which does not extend to states. Governors control their own National Guard units, and federal law, like the Posse Comitatus Act, generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Therefore, any attempt to replicate the D.C. intervention elsewhere would face significant legal and constitutional challenges.</p>
