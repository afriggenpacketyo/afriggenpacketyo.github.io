            <p>An Israeli airstrike has reportedly damaged Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, impacting its intensive care and surgery departments. The IDF stated the hospital contained a Hamas command center and took steps to mitigate harm to civilians, including advanced warnings. However, a local journalist reported receiving a phone call from the IDF ordering immediate evacuation of the hospital, leading to a rushed displacement of patients. The Hamas-run health ministry condemned the attack, while the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem reported one child's death as a result of the evacuation. </p>

            <p>The investigation into the Long Island serial killings began with the disappearance of Shannan Gilbert in 2010 and led to the discovery of multiple bodies near Gilgo Beach. The victims, known as the Gilgo Four, were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Amber Costello, Megan Waterman, and Melissa Barthelemy, all petite women in their 20s working as online escorts. Years later, a new task force was formed, leading to the arrest of Rex Heuermann, who has been charged with multiple counts of murder and is considered a prime suspect in other related cases. The investigation continues to uncover new details and potential connections to other unsolved murders in the area.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a novel solution for combating oil spills by transforming sphagnum moss into a highly effective oil-absorbing material. This modified moss repels water while efficiently soaking up oil, offering a cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternative to conventional absorbents. With its high absorption capacity and reusability, the moss-based material holds promise for mitigating the devastating impact of oil spills on ecosystems and human populations. The innovation underscores China's commitment to developing sustainable technologies for environmental protection.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies are creating widespread uncertainty and anxiety among consumers and businesses in the United States. While some individuals are attempting to stockpile goods in anticipation of price increases, others feel paralyzed by the constant policy shifts and hope for a reversal of course. The tariffs, which include levies on a wide range of imports, are expected to lead to higher prices for consumers and potential disruptions in supply chains. Economists warn that these policies could trigger a recession and negatively impact consumer spending, a key driver of the US economy.</p>

            <p>Companies are increasingly employing surveillance technologies to monitor employees, signaling a shift towards austerity and control in the workplace. This trend coincides with mass layoffs and a focus on maximizing profits, leading to a mask-off moment where companies abandon any pretense of caring about their workers. However, Gen Z is pushing back against this culture by prioritizing work-life balance, seeking secure contracts and benefits, and rejecting roles that demand long hours and overwork. Despite the challenges, young workers are demanding a more equitable exchange where loyalty is met with substantial commitment from employers.</p>

            <p>The LA Galaxy's 30th-anniversary celebration was dampened by a 1-1 draw against the Houston Dynamo, extending their winless streak. Despite a festive atmosphere and commemorative rings for fans, the Galaxy struggled on the field, conceding an early goal and facing further adversity with a player ejection. A second-half free kick from Diego Fagundez salvaged a point for the Galaxy, but the team remains near the bottom of the Western Conference standings. The club paid tribute to Cobi Jones, who scored the team's first-ever goal in 1996.</p>

            <p>A new study suggests the United States has a "rare" opportunity to become a key partner for Indonesia in emerging technology and digital infrastructure, despite Jakarta's strong economic ties with China. The report emphasizes the need for a more ambitious and strategic approach from Washington to compete with Beijing's growing influence. While Indonesia has traditionally pursued a policy of strategic autonomy, the researchers argue that deepening ties with China may conflict with this approach as the US and China increasingly decouple their economies. China has cultivated Indonesia, becoming its largest foreign investor.</p>
