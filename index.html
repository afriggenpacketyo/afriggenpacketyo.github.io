            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are continuing their strike after overwhelmingly rejecting the city council's latest pay offer, escalating a month-long dispute marked by uncollected rubbish and concerns about vermin. The Unite union deems the offer inadequate, citing potential pay cuts for drivers, while the council maintains its offer is fair. Military planners have been called in to assist with clearing the backlog of waste, with neighboring councils also offering support. The dispute centers on the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, which the union claims will result in significant pay reductions for affected workers, while the council argues the role is not industry standard.</p>

            <p>President Trump hosted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at the White House amidst ongoing controversy surrounding migrant deportations and human rights issues at El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. The meeting focused on collaborations to combat terrorist organizations and build economic prosperity, with Trump praising Bukele for accepting custody of violent alien criminals. Concerns persist regarding due process for deported migrants and alleged human rights abuses within CECOT.

            <p>OPEC has revised its oil demand forecast downwards for 2025 and 2026, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global economic growth.

Trump's tariffs on China and other countries have introduced uncertainty into the short-term economic outlook. Despite these concerns, key members of OPEC+ have agreed to accelerate oil production starting in May, leading to downward pressure on oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US stock markets experienced an upswing following the White House's decision to exempt certain Chinese-made electronics from tariffs, although President Trump hinted the exemption might be temporary. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index saw a significant increase, and Apple's share price surged due to its reliance on Chinese manufacturing. This rollback follows the imposition of substantial tariffs on most imports from China, which prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing. The Trump administration is expected to announce tariffs on semiconductors, potentially shifting the exempted electronics into this new category. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey reveals growing consumer anxiety regarding inflation, unemployment, and stock market instability amid escalating global trade tensions. Inflation expectations have risen to their highest level since October 2023, coupled with increased concerns about potential job losses. The survey also indicates a decline in expectations for stock market gains and a rise in interest in gold as a safe-haven asset. These findings align with other surveys reflecting consumer apprehension about the economic impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Photos taken after the murder of Fabio Sementilli show his wife, Monica, and Robert Baker, her alleged lover, at a family memorial. Baker, who had a bandage on his finger, was identified as a suspect after DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene. Police allowed the family to believe the murder was part of a burglary wave while secretly investigating Monica and Baker. The photos were given to police by a neighbor.</p>

            <p>Fabio Sementilli was murdered in his backyard, and prosecutors allege his wife, Monica, conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to commit the crime. Monica established an alibi by going to Target, while Baker allegedly entered the home and stabbed Fabio. Surveillance footage and phone records suggest Monica was monitoring her home remotely during the murder. Baker's DNA was found at the crime scene, and investigators discovered a secretive relationship between Monica and Baker. Baker later pleaded "no contest" to the murder.</p>

            <p>Amid stock market volatility and concerns about bond market stability, investors can seek "peace of mind" income through strategies like bond ladders. A bond ladder involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income through principal and interest payments. This approach can mitigate short-term price swings and offer a predictable income stream. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) provides a similar strategy in an ETF format, investing in treasuries with a fixed monthly income distribution until 2035. (not investment advice)</p>
