          <p>President Trump stated that Elon Musk would face significant repercussions if he supports Democratic candidates, signaling a potential escalation in their public feud. Trump accused Musk of being disrespectful to the office of the president and indicated he has no intention of speaking to him. This follows Musk's criticism of Trump's spending package and Trump's earlier claims of giving Musk "breaks" during his first administration, highlighting the deteriorated relationship between the two figures. The feud began after Musk criticized Trump's bill, leading to a series of attacks and counter-attacks on social media, culminating in Trump's threat of consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance acknowledged Elon Musk's attacks on President Trump as a "huge mistake" but attempted to downplay the situation, attributing it to Musk being an "emotional guy." Vance defended Trump against Musk's claims regarding concealed information about Trump's association with Jeffrey Epstein, asserting that Trump did nothing wrong. He defended the bill that has drawn Musk's ire, and said its central goal was not to cut spending but to extend the 2017 tax cuts approved in Trump's first term. Vance expressed hope that Musk would eventually "come back into the fold," despite the public fallout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, received a life-saving liver transplant from Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years.

The surgery involved transplanting 70% of Johnston's liver into Register, with both livers expected to regenerate over time.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, the politics of remembrance has gained momentum, with politicians turning to address sins of the past. Parliamentarians have adopted three texts that reclassify historical events or offer the prospect of reparations, including posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus and recognizing returnees from Indochina. A resolution addressing a "double debt" to Haiti, dating back to 1825, was also adopted, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations. Some experts see the willingness to take historical responsibility as a form of social maturity, while others view it as a symbolic gesture in a politically paralyzed legislature.</p>

He highlighted the potential damage from practices like bottom trawling on marine life and the ocean's ability to lock up planet-warming carbon.

The August Egg Company recalled approximately 1.7 million eggs due to potential salmonella contamination, with at least 79 people infected and 21 hospitalized. The CDC advises people to discard or return recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces that came into contact with them.

El Salvador agreed to release Mr. Ábrego García after the U.S. presented it with an arrest warrant, and his lawyer called the charges "preposterous."

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly 50% of Americans are making a significant Social Security mistake by not saving adequately for retirement. Many retirees rely heavily on Social Security, which typically replaces only 40% of pre-retirement income, leaving a substantial gap. Ramsey advises creating a savings benchmark of at least 15% of gross income, building an emergency fund, and eliminating debt to secure a more comfortable retirement. By taking these steps, individuals can supplement Social Security benefits and improve their financial outlook for their golden years. (not investment advice)</p>
