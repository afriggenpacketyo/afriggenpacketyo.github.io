          <p>Former President Donald Trump will headline a fundraiser for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the top sponsorship level is priced at $2 million. The event, hosted by the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, includes a VIP reception and the opening night performance of Les Misérables. Trump, who chairs the board and recently appointed allies to leadership positions, will appear as a special guest but will not directly solicit donations. This move follows Trump's overhaul of the center's management, which sparked controversy and cancellations from some shows.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" in response to President Trump's suggestion of making it the 51st U.S. state. Trump, while praising Carney, insisted that such a merger would be a "wonderful marriage," but Carney emphasized Canada's commitment to its sovereignty. The leaders also discussed trade, with Trump suggesting a renegotiation of the USMCA trade deal and expressing a desire for the U.S. to become economically independent from Canada. Carney's Liberal Party recently won elections on a platform of resisting Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would cease attacks on the Houthis in Yemen because the group has "capitulated" and agreed to stop targeting ships in the Red Sea. This announcement coincided with Oman confirming a "ceasefire" agreement with the Iran-backed group. The U.S. had intensified air strikes on the Houthis since March in response to their attacks on commercial ships passing through the Red Sea, which the Houthis claimed were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Houthis have continued firing missiles towards Israel, and Israel responded with attacks on Yemen's main international airport and other facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can enforce its ban on transgender troops serving in the military while legal challenges continue. The ruling, which was brief and unsigned, allows the ban to take effect immediately, reversing lower court decisions that had blocked the policy. The court's liberal members dissented, but provided no reasoning. The case concerns an executive order revoking a previous policy that allowed transgender service members to serve openly, with the administration arguing that gender identity conflicts with military service standards.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily blocking a lower court’s decision, allowing President Donald Trump's ban on transgender military service to take effect. This decision means that transgender service members are likely to be forced out of military service soon. The Court's three Democrats, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented. The Trump administration's policy bans individuals with gender dysphoria, which the government argues is a medical condition, but critics contend this is simply a way to discriminate against transgender people.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained under the Alien Enemies Act, citing the lack of a declared war, invasion, or predatory incursion. The ruling protects Venezuelan migrants from summary removal, emphasizing that they are entitled to due process. This decision follows a similar ruling in Texas, challenging the administration's claim that the gang Tren de Aragua constitutes an "invasion" justifying the use of the 1798 law. The judge also criticized the notice provided to migrants as insufficient and highlighted the wrongful removal of individuals to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If a debt collector refuses a settlement offer, it doesn't necessarily mean the end of negotiations; it simply indicates that the offer isn't acceptable at that moment. Debt collectors often reject offers if they are too low, if the debt is recent, or if they believe you can pay more. To improve the chances of settling debt, it's important to do your homework, offer proof of hardship, and consider working with a debt relief expert who can negotiate effectively. Patience and persistence are key, as settlement negotiations can take time and require consistent follow-up.</p>

While bank statement loans have more flexible standards, they often come with higher interest rates and require larger down payments. Borrowers still need a good credit score and sufficient income history to qualify, but this type of loan can be a viable alternative for those with non-traditional income sources.

Harris has also criticized President Donald Trump over tariffs and government cuts, and made a surprise appearance at the Met Gala. She is reportedly considering a run for governor in California and has signed with talent agency CAA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising vote, 35 House Democrats joined Republicans to repeal California's mandate requiring all new vehicles sold in the state to be electric or otherwise nonpolluting by 2035. Some Democrats cited concerns about the high cost and impracticality of electric vehicles in their districts, while others pointed to intense lobbying from the oil industry. Environmentalists expressed disappointment, noting that the ban, adopted by 11 other states, was expected to help shift the country toward cleaner vehicles. The vote underscores a potential division within the Democratic party on climate policy amid economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The Israeli plan to occupy and depopulate Gaza may not be identical to Donald Trump’s vision of a new riviera, but his inspiration and the US’s walkaway diplomacy have ushered Benjamin Netanyahu to the precipice of a dire new chapter in the Israel-Gaza war. The common perception in both Washington and Israel is that Trump has largely moved on, leaving an emboldened Netanyahu to his own devices, while his offhand proposals for turning Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East” have provided cover for rightwing Israeli politicians to enthusiastically support the forced resettlement of the Palestinian population. As the White House’s growing disinterest has incentivized Netanyahu, he appears to have been unleashed by the White House’s growing disinterest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing its ban on transgender military service members while appeals continue in lower courts. The justices blocked a lower court order that temporarily halted the ban's enforcement. This decision follows President Trump's executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, which the Defense Department promptly implemented. The new policy, which bans active duty transgender service members in addition to banning their enlistment, mimics a previous transgender military ban established during the first Trump Administration.</p>

The NEA cited a shift in grantmaking policy to focus on projects reflecting the nation's "rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President."

The change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, as their Medicaid budgets tend to be more reliant on these taxes. These taxes allow states to inflate Medicaid spending and collect more matching funds from the federal government, which some Republicans have criticized as "gimmicks" and "money laundering." Proposals to ban the taxes do not include provisions to replace lost dollars, potentially leaving states with significant budget holes.</p>
