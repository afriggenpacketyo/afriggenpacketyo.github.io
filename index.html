          <p>The Lakers are undergoing an ownership change, with Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and TWG Global acquiring majority ownership. This move is seen as a positive development for the team, as Walter's group has a proven track record of success with the Dodgers. The new ownership is expected to bring significant investment in infrastructure, coaching, and player development, with a focus on sustained championship contention. While the Buss family's legacy is respected, the change is viewed as necessary to modernize the organization and enhance its competitiveness.</p>

Continued record emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have shrunk the carbon budget, making the Paris Agreement target increasingly difficult to achieve. The current rate of warming is about 0.27C per decade, and if emissions remain high, the planet is on track to reach 1.5C of warming around 2030. Scientists emphasize the importance of rapid and stringent emissions cuts to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced the closure of the national suicide hotline's specialized support for LGBTQ+ youth, effective July 17. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) stated that the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will focus on serving all help seekers, rather than siloing LGBTQ+ youth services. The Trevor Project, which provided support for the specialized program, expressed concern over the decision, noting that it will eliminate life-saving services for LGBTQ+ young people. Studies show that LGBTQ+ youth report higher rates of poor mental health and suicidal thoughts.</p>
