          <p>Cartier owner Richemont exceeded expectations in its fiscal fourth-quarter sales, reporting a 7% year-on-year increase, driven by robust growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While sales in the specialist watchmakers segment declined, overall annual sales rose by 4% to 21.4 billion euros. Despite challenges such as fluctuating gold prices and foreign exchange rates, Richemont's pricing power and strategic agility have enabled it to navigate global economic uncertainties, demonstrating the continued strength of luxury spending among affluent consumers. The company remains cautious, acknowledging the need for discipline amid ongoing global uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in South Korea, member nations urgently sought discussions with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to address concerns over impending U.S. tariffs. With a 90-day pause on tariffs expiring in July, countries aimed to negotiate permanent trade deals, particularly after the U.S. imposed duties on goods from numerous trading partners. While Britain has reached an agreement with the U.S., South Korea faces challenges in trade talks due to upcoming elections, and Mr. Greer also met with China's trade envoy to discuss tariff reductions, but the broader impact of U.S. trade policies looms large over the region's economic outlook, leading APEC to slash its growth forecast. The article describes how APEC cut its forecast for growth to 2.6 percent from its previous projection of 3.3 percent.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are set to meet in Istanbul for the first direct peace talks since the start of the war, though expectations for significant progress remain low. Despite President Trump's support for the negotiations, President Zelensky expressed skepticism about Russia's seriousness and the organization of the talks. The Trump administration has also cast doubt on the prospects, suggesting a breakthrough requires a meeting between Trump and Putin.

          <p>A statewide transit strike commenced in New Jersey as 450 unionized locomotive engineers walked off their jobs due to a pay dispute, shutting down NJ Transit's rail network and impacting tens of thousands of commuters. While the bus system continues to operate, chartered buses can only accommodate a fraction of displaced train riders, prompting commuters to work from home if possible. The strike, the first in the state since 1983, follows months of unsuccessful negotiations and federal interventions, with the union demanding pay parity with other regional railroads, which NJ Transit argues would lead to significant fare increases. The article notes that the strike has already led to cancellations of train and bus services to events at MetLife Stadium, causing concerns for concertgoers.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a greater-than-expected contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% decrease due to falling exports and stagnant consumption. The decline was exacerbated by U.S. President Trump's tariffs, which imposed a 24% tariff on Japanese goods and an additional 25% levy on cars. Despite attempts to negotiate a trade deal, uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies has hindered economic planning. The Japanese central bank is gradually hiking rates to boost the economy, but analysts caution that the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is investigating former F.B.I. director James Comey for a social media post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump's assassination. Comey's Instagram post, which he later removed, featured seashells forming the numbers “86 47,” a phrase used by critics of the president, leading to accusations from administration officials. Despite Comey's explanation that he didn't realize the association with violence, the F.B.I. and Secret Service are supporting the investigation.
