Local station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair planned to preempt the show's return on some ABC affiliate stations.

          <p>The FDA has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products due to potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. AquaStar is recalling three types of shrimp sold in grocery stores across 31 states because they may have been prepared, packed, or held in unsanitary conditions. The investigation began after the detection of Cesium-137 in imported frozen shrimp from Indonesia. Consumers are advised to dispose of or return affected shrimp for a refund, as the FDA is investigating the source of the contamination. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service disrupted a telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area that posed a potential threat to New York's telecom systems and the United Nations General Assembly meetings. The network included active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings with 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards. The network was capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and could have disabled cell phone towers. Early analysis indicates the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement. </p>

          <p>A top official at the Department of Justice (DoJ), Aakash Singh, who is directing aggressive prosecutions of minor crimes, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence four years ago. The official's subsequent elevation to a high-ranking post is unusual in light of that arrest, experts said. Singh received the promotion from assistant US attorney after Trump took office, following a relatively brief legal career. Singh has been instructing attorneys to prioritize charges against protesters and people committing misdemeanors. </p>

          <p>Doctors at one of Gaza City's last functioning hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties from Israeli strikes, carrying out operations in unsanitary conditions with limited or no anaesthetics. An Australian medic described the situation as a mass murder and torture, and another medic stated that a baby was saved from the body of a pregnant woman who had been decapitated. Israeli forces are advancing into Gaza City, exacerbating the crisis. Around one million Palestinians were estimated to be living in Gaza City before the offensive. </p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a pioneering scholar of Chinese law who shaped global debates on the country’s legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades, has died at 95. He was a professor emeritus at New York University’s School of Law and the founder of its US-Asia Law Institute. Cohen began his career in Chinese law in 1960 and was the first American to practice law in the country under Communist rule. His writings on Chinese criminal procedure and China’s interactions with international law are considered groundbreaking. </p>
