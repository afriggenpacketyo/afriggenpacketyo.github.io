          <p>Grammy-winning artist Bad Bunny is reportedly facing public scrutiny after appearing to remain seated during the singing of "God Bless America" at a New York Yankees playoff game. A photo and video obtained by TMZ Sports show the musician sitting while others around him stood for the patriotic song. The incident has drawn further attention to his past critical remarks about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Bad Bunny has previously expressed concern for his fans' safety regarding potential ICE presence at his U.S. concerts, creating a point of controversy for the popular performer.</p>

          <p>A middle school in Brooklyn, once listed as persistently dangerous with declining enrollment, has seen a dramatic turnaround after implementing a unique educational strategy. Principal Benjamin Honoroff, a former debate coach, introduced debate into every class, from math to English, and expanded the school's competitive team. This approach has significantly improved students' academic performance, with proficiency scores in English and math rising to 60% and 70% respectively. The school's debate team recently won a national championship, highlighting the success of this innovative educational initiative in a struggling community.</p>

          <p>Internet monitoring groups and local residents report that access to major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, has been restricted across Afghanistan. This move follows a 2022 ban on TikTok and a recent temporary, near-total internet shutdown ordered by the Taliban at the end of September. While some platforms like WhatsApp and X appear to remain accessible, many users now require Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to bypass the new limitations. The restrictions represent a significant tightening of information control, raising concerns among rights groups about the implications for the country's population.</p>

A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are anticipating heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding. Officials are also warning of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions as swells generated by the storm spread throughout the region.</p>

          <p>Anxiety is growing in Portland, Oregon, over the Trump administration's efforts to deploy National Guard troops to address ongoing protests outside an ICE facility. Local business owners express concern that the president's rhetoric, describing the city as a "war zone," is harming their recovery from the pandemic and social justice protests of 2020. While federal courts have issued temporary orders blocking the deployment of both Oregon and out-of-state troops, the legal battle is ongoing. The situation has created a tense standoff between local and federal authorities over the management of protests and public safety.</p>

          <p>Priscilla, which briefly reached hurricane strength, has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to the coast of Mexico's Baja California Sur. The storm is bringing high surf and gusty winds to the region, prompting a tropical storm watch for the southern part of the peninsula. According to the National Hurricane Center, Priscilla is expected to continue weakening over the next two days while remaining offshore. Authorities have warned residents and visitors about the likelihood of life-threatening surf, rip currents, and potential coastal flooding generated by the storm's large swells.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation. The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony before a Senate panel regarding his authorization of anonymous sources within the FBI. Appearing in court for his arraignment, Comey was released on his own recognizance, with a trial date tentatively set for early January. The prosecution, initiated by the Trump administration's Justice Department, marks a significant escalation in the ongoing political conflict between the former president and the former FBI chief.</p>

The case was brought by an Illinois congressman who contested a state regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted for up to 14 days after Election Day, arguing it reduced his margin of victory. Justices from both conservative and liberal wings appeared skeptical of the arguments presented by both the congressman's lawyer and the state of Illinois.

Citing concerns over border control and national sovereignty, some politicians are advocating for withdrawal from the treaty, which was largely drafted by British lawyers after World War II. Opponents argue that leaving the ECHR would undermine human rights protections and could have severe consequences for international agreements like the Good Friday Agreement. The debate has been intensified by its connection to the highly charged issue of illegal immigration, turning a complex legal matter into a political flashpoint.</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has warned of a higher-than-perceived risk of a significant downturn in U.S. stock markets. In an interview, Dimon stated he is "far more worried than others" about a potential market correction within the next six months to two years, citing geopolitical uncertainty and global remilitarization as key risk factors. While acknowledging the real potential of AI, he compared the current investment surge to past bubbles, suggesting some investments will likely be lost. He also commented on U.S. global reliability and the independence of the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that Ukrainian forces are inflicting significant casualties on Russian troops during a counteroffensive in the eastern Donetsk region. Citing a report from his top commander, Zelenskiy highlighted the success of the "Dobropillia operation," which is taking place north of the strategic hub of Pokrovsk. This account contrasts with recent statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who claimed his forces hold the strategic initiative along the entire front.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic criticizes the increasing use of profanity by American politicians, arguing that it is an attempt to appear authentic or "cool" that ultimately debases public discourse. The piece cites recent examples from figures like Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, as well as President Trump's frequent use of vulgar language. The author contends that while swearing can be a cathartic and effective tool when used sparingly, its overuse by public officials normalizes crudeness and fails to set a proper standard of behavior. Politics, the writer argues, should aspire to a higher level of decorum.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline during a recent meeting in Washington. The topic was reportedly raised by Carney in the context of broader trade discussions, including U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. The pipeline project, which would transport oil from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations but has been supported by Trump. The company behind the project had previously stated it had "moved on," but the new discussions suggest a possible reconsideration.</p>

Intrator argued that these deals represent a necessary and massive infrastructure buildout to meet real client demand, not just money being passed between firms.

          <p>As the Palace Museum in Beijing approaches its centenary, its history is marked by a remarkable wartime journey and a lasting division. Between 1933 and 1950, to protect them from invasion and civil war, thousands of crates containing priceless imperial artifacts were transported over 10,000 miles across China. This monumental effort ensured the survival of a vast collection of national heritage. However, the collection was ultimately split, with a significant portion moved to Taiwan, leading to the establishment of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. This division continues to reflect the complex political tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

Democratic senators from Arizona confronted Johnson, who denied the delay was politically motivated to prevent a key vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The standoff is part of the broader political battle over government funding, with Republicans demanding concessions from Democrats before reopening the government and resuming normal House business.</p>

This comparison comes after President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.
