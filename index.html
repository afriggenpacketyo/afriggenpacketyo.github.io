          <p>President Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, a Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges, preventing him from serving a 10-year prison sentence. Trump criticized the Biden Department of Justice and the judge in the case, claiming Jenkins was unfairly targeted and denied the opportunity to present exculpatory evidence. Jenkins was convicted in December 2024 for accepting over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The Department of Justice stated that Jenkins violated his oath of office by engaging in a cash-for-badges scheme.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set three mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, viewing it as a challenge to the state's outsize influence on national emissions standards. For over half a century, California has been granted waivers by the EPA to enforce stricter pollution limits, leading to more efficient vehicles and a push for electric cars. Republican lawmakers, particularly those from states reliant on the fossil fuel industry, argue that California's policies are impractical and represent a liberal agenda. California's governor has vowed to fight in court to preserve the state's autonomy in setting emissions rules.</p>

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may paint an overly optimistic picture of the economy. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, includes not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment and those in poverty-wage jobs. The measure aims to capture labor market nuances missed by other indicators, such as those left behind during economic expansion. The LISEP chairman noted that the unemployment data has some flaws, such as counting people as employed if they've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump honored military veterans in a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, but also included personal boasting and partisan attacks. While acknowledging the sacrifices of fallen soldiers, Trump inserted political comments about fixing the republic after a "hard four years" and criticized border security policies. He also promoted the upcoming 250th anniversary of the US Army, stating it would surpass the World Cup and Olympics. Trump's remarks drew criticism for mixing political messaging with a solemn occasion.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed imposing 50 percent tariffs on the European Union, providing an opportunity for renewed trade discussions. Despite this delay, significant differences persist between the United States and the European Union, making a rapid agreement uncertain. European negotiators are hesitant to agree to many of Trumpâ€™s demands, including changes to their consumption tax system and digital regulations. The European Union hopes to reduce across-the-board tariffs implemented in April, but the Trump administration appears firm on maintaining the current 10 percent tariff floor.</p>

          <p>An article in the New York Times explores the history of electric vehicles, noting their popularity in the early 20th century before being overtaken by gasoline-powered cars. The Trump administration's efforts to undermine electric vehicle growth and favor oil raise concerns about a potential repeat of history. The article discusses factors such as limited range, charging infrastructure, and political opposition that contributed to the decline of early electric cars. It also touches on gender stereotypes and the association of gasoline cars with masculinity.</p>

          <p>Analysts are cautioning investors to prepare for continued volatility despite President Trump's delay in rolling out tariffs on the European Union. The delay, until July 9, provides a window for negotiations, but significant differences remain, and the potential for a trade war persists. Economists suggest the EU is unlikely to capitulate to Trump's tactics, and that if high tariffs are imposed, the EU will have no choice but to implement countermeasures. The EU is hoping offers to reduce the trade deficit by agreeing to buy more American liquefied natural gas and advanced microchips will help to convince U.S. officials to strike a deal.

          <p>England completed a dominant T20 series clean sweep against the West Indies, winning the third and final match by 17 runs. Hayley Matthews played brilliantly for the West Indies, but her dismissal led to a collapse in the chase. Lauren Bell's spell was exceptional with figures of 2-11, while Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 from 47 balls was pivotal for England's total. The teams will now face each other in a three-match one-day international series.</p>

          <h2>George Lucas Takes Control as Museum Nears Completion</h2>

          <p>George Lucas is now taking a more active role in his Museum of Narrative Art as it nears completion in Los Angeles, appointing himself as the head of "content direction." The museum parted ways with its director and chief executive, Sandra Jackson-Dumont, and eliminated several positions. The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, though some cultural leaders feel the definition is too broad. The museum will feature items from Lucas's extensive collection of magazine illustrations, Norman Rockwell paintings, and comic books, as well as memorabilia from his films.</p>
