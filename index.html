            <p>Tim Seymour, a trader on "Fast Money," provides four key tips for investors navigating a volatile market to avoid potential losses. His advice includes not investing more than one can afford to lose, avoiding holding onto losing positions based on hope, reassessing investment rationales regularly, and prioritizing high-quality companies. He emphasizes making decisions based on merit rather than emotion, adjusting strategies as market fundamentals change, and sticking with strong companies that tend to outperform during downturns.

            <p>David Marcus argues that while President Trump's approach to fixing the immigration system may be harsh, it is necessary to address the chaos created by the Biden administration's policies. He highlights the significant drop in illegal border crossings as evidence of the policy's success, attributing it to the deterrent effect of stricter enforcement. Marcus criticizes Democrats for focusing on individual cases while ignoring the broader consequences of unchecked illegal immigration, including crime and economic strain. The article frames Trump's actions as a necessary, albeit difficult, step towards securing the nation's borders.</p>

            <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of the president's tariffs and arguing they are causing significant economic harm to the state. Governor Newsom argues that the tariffs, enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, exceed the president's authority and violate the US Constitution. The lawsuit seeks to halt the enforcement of the tariffs, claiming they disproportionately affect California's manufacturing and agricultural sectors. This marks the first time a state has taken legal action against the Trump administration over its tariff policies.</p>

            <p>The abrupt removal of a Huntington Park City Council member, Esmerelda Castillo, has raised concerns about due process and political motivations. The city investigated Castillo's residency and concluded she was not a resident, removing her from the council without her knowledge. Castillo has filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging the removal was politically motivated, especially after she accused members of bullying and harassment. The city maintains the removal was based on a valid residency investigation, but the situation has sparked anger and legal challenges in the scandal-plagued city.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration. Despite the administration admitting the deportation was an "administrative error" and the Supreme Court ordering them to "facilitate" his return, Mr. Bukele, President of El Salvador, said he would not let Mr. Ábrego García return to the US. The Trump administration claims Mr. Ábrego García has ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by his family and lawyers. This situation raises concerns about the administration's immigration policies and treatment of individuals.</p>

The judge stated that the government's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the court's order.

            <p>The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has warned that President Trump's new tariffs on goods entering the country will negatively impact US economic growth and increase prices for consumers.

He noted that surveys of households and businesses reported a "sharp decline" in their sentiment over the economic outlook due to tariff concerns. The US President has said tariffs will boost US manufacturing and jobs, but stock markets have been spooked.</p>
