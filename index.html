        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer has raised its adjusted profit guidance for the full year, citing effective cost-cutting strategies and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely driven by sales of its COVID-19 products and other key drugs. Consequently, the company now projects a full-year adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This updated outlook also considers potential impacts from the Trump administration's efforts to lower drug prices and impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, demonstrating the company's confidence amidst regulatory pressures.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir saw its stock jump after announcing a significant earnings beat and raising its full-year revenue forecast. The company's quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time, a 48% increase year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence platforms. CEO Alex Karp described the results as a "once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter," highlighting substantial growth in both its U.S. commercial and government sectors. The performance reflects Palantir's successful capitalization on the current AI wave and increased focus on efficiency from its clients.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst predictions, primarily due to poor performance from its Pizza Hut and KFC chains in the United States. Both brands experienced a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, struggling with value messaging and competition in a challenging consumer environment. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to be a strong performer, reporting a 4% same-store sales growth globally, bolstered by new product launches.

          <p>A political and legal standoff is unfolding in Texas after more than 50 Democratic state lawmakers left the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the lawmakers arrested and removed from office, though legal experts suggest his authority is limited outside of Texas. The Republican-led plan could grant the GOP up to five additional U.S. House seats. The Democrats, who fled to Illinois, maintain their actions are a constitutionally permitted quorum break to protect representative democracy from partisan gerrymandering.</p>

To ensure their firsthand accounts of the nuclear attacks are not lost, a new generation of "successors" is taking on the role of sharing these stories. Individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki are actively engaging with international visitors to convey the horrific reality of the bombings and advocate for peace. These efforts, supported by museums and organizations, aim to use the truth of the past to prevent future wartime atrocities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has made several public comments suggesting he might seek a third presidential term, despite the U.S. Constitution's two-term limit. While recently stating he would be a "two-term president," he has previously claimed he was "not joking" about running again and that "there are methods which you could do it." These remarks have fueled speculation and concern, with some allies even introducing resolutions to amend the Constitution. Election law experts note that such a change is highly improbable, viewing the discussion as a political tactic to project strength and avoid a lame-duck status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup report reveals that Gen Z workers are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work, with only 23% preferring it. Instead, a significant 71% of Gen Z employees favor a hybrid model, expressing a desire for in-person connection, mentorship, and a clearer understanding of their role within their organization. The findings suggest that younger employees feel their career development is compromised in a completely virtual setting. Experts attribute this preference to the importance of spontaneous interactions for learning and a need to combat loneliness, which is more prevalent among younger workers.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is sounding the alarm on a severe hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, where an estimated 31 million people face acute food insecurity. Protracted insecurity, driven by jihadist groups and banditry, has displaced millions of farmers, crippling agricultural production in the nation's traditional heartland. The situation is exacerbated by critical funding shortfalls for aid organizations like the World Food Programme, which has been forced to halt its emergency food aid. Analysts argue the crisis stems from a fundamental failure of governance and security, leaving rural populations vulnerable to exploitation and starvation.</p>

As of early August 2025, average rates for these products are in the low-to-mid 8% range, substantially lower than typical personal loan or credit card rates. A home equity loan provides a lump sum at a fixed rate, while a HELOC offers a variable-rate revolving line of credit.

Duckworth is demanding data from recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated real-world testing, which was supposed to be completed in May.

          <p>Russia has entered the escalating trade dispute between the United States and India, with the Kremlin asserting that New Delhi has the sovereign right to choose its trading partners. The statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose steep tariffs on India for its continued purchase of Russian oil. The Kremlin dismissed these threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever trade relations with Russia. The spat is being closely watched, as India's trade relationship with Russia, particularly in oil imports, has grown significantly since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been released on police bail after being arrested in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station in London. The arrest took place at Luton Airport upon his return from Faro, Portugal. British Transport Police had sought to question him after he left the country following the incident on July 28, which left a man with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Robinson was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and has been bailed until September 2 as inquiries continue.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly instructed the Justice Department to proceed with a grand jury inquiry into the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows the recent release of declassified documents by Trump administration officials aimed at questioning the legitimacy of the original probe. The development escalates a long-running effort by President Trump and his allies to investigate the investigators and is likely to intensify concerns that the Justice Department is being used for political purposes. It is not yet clear which former officials could be targeted by the investigation.</p>

In stark contrast, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD posted astronomical growth in the same markets, with sales more than quadrupling in the U.K. The data underscores the shifting dynamics in the European EV market.</p>

The debate balances the public's right to information against the need to prevent misinformation and ensure a fair trial, an issue highlighted by recent riots in Southport fueled by false rumors about a suspect's background.</p>

This surge coincides with plans by the Trump administration to restrict access to future booster shots, potentially limiting them to older individuals and those with specific health conditions. Health experts express concern that reduced vaccination rates and waning immunity could lead to more severe future waves. They argue that broad vaccination is key to reducing viral spread and criticize the move away from science-driven public health decisions.</p>
