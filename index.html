          <p>A UK minister warns of potential drinking water shortages within a decade, prompting the government to expedite the planning for two new reservoirs.  This decision overrides local concerns, potentially causing public backlash, though supporters argue it's necessary for the greater good.  The reservoirs, if completed, would increase water resilience in a region facing high demand and drought risks.  However, some experts advocate for alternative water management strategies, such as reducing waste and improving water recycling, to address the issue more effectively.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the return of a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico without proper due process.  The Justice Department will arrange a charter flight to return the man, O.C.G., to the U.S. for asylum proceedings.  The judge found that necessary due process steps were ignored, and that the Trump administration's declaration that O.C.G. had no fear of being sent to Mexico was made in error. The case highlights concerns about due process violations in deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the evolving state of the Senate filibuster, noting its erosion by both parties over time.  Recent actions, such as bypassing the parliamentarian's ruling on a California air pollution law, demonstrate the weakening of this procedural rule.  The upcoming consideration of President Trump's domestic agenda bill further tests the filibuster's future.  The author predicts that the minority party will likely seek to exploit any perceived weakening of the filibuster when it regains power.</p>

          <p>The recent US court ruling blocking most of President Trump's tariffs has limited impact on the US-UK trade deal, as the tariffs on UK cars and steel/aluminum remain unchanged.  The deal to reduce these tariffs is yet to be implemented.  The ruling does affect other UK goods but the White House plans to appeal.  The uncertainty surrounding tariffs creates challenges for businesses planning and investment.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the author's experience of a stranger gently correcting her daughter's behavior in Prague with the reluctance of Americans to do the same.  This difference highlights the shift from a more communal approach to child-rearing to a more privatized model in the US.  Historians note that collective child discipline was once common in America, but has declined due to societal changes and increased legal concerns. The author argues that a more balanced approach, involving both parental and community involvement, may be beneficial.</p>
