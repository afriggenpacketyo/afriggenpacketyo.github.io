          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, asserting it was the president's right to deport people. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected her, clarifying that habeas corpus is a legal right protecting individuals from unlawful detention by requiring the government to justify detentions. This incident occurred amidst discussions about potentially suspending habeas corpus for immigrants, a move legal experts believe only Congress can authorize. Noem's inaccurate definition reflects a broader Trump administration view on presidential power regarding immigration enforcement, raising concerns about constitutional rights.

Downing Street and ministers expressed disapproval, stating that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations, as the company faces scrutiny over sewage discharges and financial stability.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after making a controversial remark about receiving gifted rice amid soaring rice prices, sparking public outrage. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address public concerns. Eto's comment, made at a fundraising event, was perceived as insensitive given the financial struggles of many households facing rising food costs. The incident occurred as the government attempts to lower rice prices by releasing emergency stockpiles, and it has negatively impacted Ishiba's approval ratings ahead of an upcoming election.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 in a dramatic 10-inning game after Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched seven shutout innings. Despite Yamamoto's strong performance, the Dodgers nearly lost the lead due to a blown save and a late-inning rally by the Diamondbacks. However, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the 10th with key hits and walks, culminating in a walk-off sacrifice fly by Max Muncy. This victory helps the Dodgers maintain their lead in the National League West and avoid a five-game losing streak. (optimism_score: 75)</p>

          <p>A BBC report highlights the growing concern over nicotine pouch use among young people, with some using them as a way to quit vaping, only to become addicted to the pouches. These pouches, placed between the lip and gum, are unregulated in the UK and easily accessible to children, raising fears that the upcoming ban on disposable vapes could lead to increased pouch use. Health experts warn that nicotine pouches are addictive and can have harmful side effects, including gum recession and other oral health issues.

          <p>A new study from the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre has revealed that high doses of radiotherapy, commonly used to treat localized cancer tumors, may paradoxically promote the growth of existing metastatic tumors. Researchers discovered that radiation could lead to the growth of tumors even when those tumors had not directly received radiation therapy. This groundbreaking work suggests that high doses of radiation could be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to distant metastasis. (optimism_score: 40)</p>

          <p>Malaysia's semiconductor industry, a key part of the global supply chain, faces uncertainty due to President Trump's trade policies. While Malaysia was seen as a beneficiary of US-China trade tensions, potential tariffs on Malaysian exports could undermine its goal of becoming a high-tech chip manufacturer. Trump's administration imposed a 24 percent levy on all Malaysian exports to the United States. Those tariffs were soon put on hold. The two countries are in negotiations —\nthe status of which is unclear. Malaysian goods are subject to a 10 percent base-line tariff Mr. Trump has imposed. The industry is closely monitoring the situation and seeking ways to mitigate the impact of potential trade disruptions. (optimism_score: 50)</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil, in particular, experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with fires destroying vast areas of the Amazon rainforest. The report emphasizes that the underlying cause is climate change, with forests becoming increasingly susceptible to intense and widespread blazes. However, countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have shown progress in reducing forest loss through fire prevention efforts and stricter deforestation laws. (optimism_score: 45)</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that media focus on young men supposedly voting for the far right is misplaced, and that the more significant trend is young women increasingly turning to the left. While gender gaps exist in support for far-right parties, the primary driver is a leftward shift among young women. This shift presents a political opportunity for centre-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the "working-class" voter.
