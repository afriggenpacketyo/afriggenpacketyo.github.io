The meeting's stakes are high, with a vital free trade agreement hanging in the balance amid economic concerns. Ramaphosa, a seasoned diplomat, also hoped to address Elon Musk's criticisms of South Africa's affirmative action laws, as the country seeks to maintain crucial trade relations with the United States.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses report that operating in China has become increasingly challenging, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and perceived depreciation of foreign firms. Despite these issues, British firms remain committed to the Chinese market, seeking a more favorable policy environment with clear and consistently enforced rules. Escalating tensions between China and the US have further complicated matters, causing delays in investments both in China and globally.

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage with a remark about never buying rice, the country's staple grain, amid a national shortage. The comment fueled criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices and supply issues, exacerbating Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's already low approval ratings. Opposition parties threatened a no-confidence motion, leading to Eto's resignation and the appointment of Shinjiro Koizumi as his replacement.

Cities like Seattle and Portland could face catastrophic damage, with the most severe effects felt in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.

          <p>Six months before Bruno Fernandes moved to Old Trafford from Sporting in January 2020 for £47m, Fernandes was all set for sign for Spurs under Mauricio Pochettino. The deal was all but done, after five meetings with his entourage and Spurs left Fernandes and his people impressed with the north London club's structure. However, the club board changed their mind, holding out for an offer twice as big that never arrived. With the transfer window closing, they made the decision during the Europa League draw in Monaco to sell Raphinha to Rennes instead.</p>

          <p>The internet has fundamentally changed our world, and grooming and exploitation no longer happen only in person – they happen on smartphones, in video games and through tablets handed over to keep kids entertained. Recent research from Childlight, a child safety charity at the University of Edinburgh, has shown a steep rise in online grooming cases, and estimates that about 830,000 young people worldwide are at risk of social exploitation and abuse every day. Tech companies need to be regulated by government to be accountable for creating safer environments, and the Online Safety Act will be implemented in Britain, with clear safety rules for platforms to protect young people from harmful content, online abuse and sexual material.</p>
