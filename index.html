          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump to discuss the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. The talks will address international concerns about starvation and how to facilitate aid delivery, following the recent halt of negotiations in Qatar. Starmer has also recalled his cabinet for a rare summer meeting to address the situation. The meeting underscores growing international pressure on Israel to allow unhindered access for humanitarian supplies into the territory.</p>

          <p>An attack by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels on a Catholic church in Komanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, has resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people, including nine children. The insurgent group, which has ties to the so-called "Islamic State," also set fire to nearby houses and shops during the Sunday service. The UN peacekeeping mission condemned the targeted attack on defenseless civilians. This massacre marks an end to a period of relative calm in the Ituri province, a region long plagued by violence from numerous armed groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a framework deal on trade, setting a 15% US tariff on many EU goods, a compromise from a threatened 30%. The agreement is being hailed as a significant political victory for President Trump, who also secured EU commitments to purchase billions in US energy and arms. While Brussels avoids a more damaging trade war and gains some certainty, the deal represents a major concession and will still result in higher costs for European exporters compared to previous rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's technology hub of Shenzhen has implemented new rules to foster innovation by offering leniency to researchers whose state-funded projects fail. The policy states that if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power, innovators should not be punished or have their future funding applications hindered. This move is designed to encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to "boldly explore uncharted territories" without the fear of career-damaging repercussions from unsuccessful but well-intentioned research efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A far-right party, Sanseito, has seen a significant surge in Japanese politics, winning 15 seats in recent elections by capitalizing on public frustration with the economy and rising anti-immigrant sentiment. The party's "Japan First" slogan, influenced by Donald Trump, resonates with voters angered by inflation, stagnant wages, and perceived problems caused by tourists and foreign residents. This populist shift presents a serious challenge to the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party and signals a new, more volatile era in Japan's traditionally stable political landscape.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025, stated he was unfamiliar with the conservative plan's chapter on overhauling the Federal Reserve, suggesting President Trump's pressure on the institution is driven by a desire for lower interest rates. The Project 2025 blueprint recommends limiting the Fed's mandate to the sole objective of stable money. Vought's comments come as Trump has intensified his criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, focusing on the cost of office renovations as a potential pretense for his removal.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing pressure from a bipartisan coalition, led by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, to hold a vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson has called the push "reckless," citing concerns for protecting innocent victims, a claim Massie refutes by stating the bill already includes redactions for victims' names. The internal GOP division highlights the political sensitivity of the issue, with Massie warning that failing to hold a vote could become a liability for Republicans.</p>
