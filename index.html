          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, according to the Department of Justice. The Swiss financial services corporation allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, falsifying bank records to conceal U.S. ownership. Whistleblowers, former Credit Suisse bankers, provided the DOJ, IRS, and Senate with detailed evidence, including names, Social Security numbers, and passports of U.S.-linked account holders, exposing the company's misconduct.

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a key driver of the nation's economy, faces a significant threat from potential U.S. tariffs. Despite a recent economic collapse and political instability, the garment sector has thrived, employing millions and contributing significantly to exports. The possibility of tariffs, especially after a pause on a new 37 percent charge, worries workers and economists, who fear it could undermine the country's growth. The industry has transformed itself since the Rana Plaza disaster, focusing on improved safety and sustainability, but tariffs could reverse this progress.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ended a tariff loophole that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the United States without paying tariffs, potentially impacting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs, has been closed for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change could reduce the volume of shipments from e-commerce companies selling Chinese goods in the United States, affecting revenue for logistics companies and airlines. Temu, a major e-commerce company, has already shifted to fulfilling U.S. orders from within the country.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Proposes Federal Film Tax Credit Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry, a day after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal aims to strengthen domestic production and build on California's existing state program. The move comes as the industry faces challenges from states and nations offering rich tax credits and cheaper labor. While some worried about the impact of tariffs, others called for federal help in the form of tax credits.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed disbelief and skepticism regarding President Trump's suggestion to convert the former prison back into a federal penitentiary. Many visitors questioned the practicality and historical appropriateness of the idea, citing the island's deteriorated condition and high maintenance costs. While some supporters were interested in the idea, most felt it was not a serious proposal and would undermine the island's significance as a historic landmark and tourist attraction. Local officials and historians also criticized the plan.</p>

He said the Trump administration's rationale was "laughable" and denied allegations of antisemitism.

          <p>A judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order follows a federal appeals court ruling that the government should continue processing those who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The judge rejected the administration's interpretation that it should only process refugees scheduled to travel within two weeks of Trump's order. The refugee program provides legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war or persecution.</p>

The memo stated that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang.
