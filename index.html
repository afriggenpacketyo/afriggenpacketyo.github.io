          <p>A suspect is in custody following a violent incident at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, where six people were injured during a march in support of Israeli hostages. Witnesses reported that the suspect used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails, allegedly yelling "free Palestine" during the attack. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence and terrorism, with victims ranging in age from 67 to 88. The attack occurred during a weekly silent march to raise awareness for hostages held in Gaza since Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack, leaving the community shaken and prompting increased security measures. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime. The community and authorities are focused on supporting the victims and ensuring the safety of the Boulder Jewish community.

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting while attending the University of Michigan, has reportedly fled the United States. Gao allegedly admitted to registering and casting a vote in the 2024 general election and was subsequently charged with unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit. Despite a judge's order to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai, China, using a Chinese passport. He is now federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China, and the case is one of very few instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections in modern history.

          <p>Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes in a coordinated drone strike on five military airfields deep inside Russia, an operation called "Spider’s Web" that took 18 months to plan. The operation, overseen by President Zelenskyy, allegedly used small FPV drones hidden in wooden cabins mounted on trucks to strike strategic bombers and surveillance planes. Russia called the strike a "terrorist act" but admitted several aircraft caught fire, while Ukraine claimed 34% of Russia’s strategic bombers were hit, estimating the damage at $7 billion. The attack occurred just before planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, though the White House claimed they were not informed about the attack in advance.

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses the increasing internationalization of American higher education and its implications. The author notes that in the 2023-24 school year, over 1.1 million international students were enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities, a significant increase from previous decades. Universities have been admitting foreign students due to financial benefits, as they often receive less financial aid than American students. The author suggests that a serious debate is needed to assess whether the internationalization of the American student body has been a positive development and whether it should continue.

          <p>María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, anticipates a new wave of repression from Nicolás Maduro's regime following the United States' decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela. Machado, who is in hiding, says the Venezuelan government is increasingly isolated and faces an unsustainable economic crisis. Despite Maduro's claims of victory in recent elections, Machado asserts that only 12% of the electorate voted, signaling a monumental defeat for the regime. While acknowledging that the army still supports Maduro and the opposition remains divided, Machado believes that the economic crisis and reduced support from allies may soon lead to more difficult times for the Venezuelan leader.

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs due to widespread family displacement. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation, as over 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England. Families are being displaced due to a lack of permanent affordable housing, leading to disruptions in children's education and healthcare access.

          <p>The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, a reality TV series set in suburban Utah, offers a look into the lives of Mormon women managing scandals, marital breakdowns, and clashes over business ventures. The series follows a group of Mormon mothers who gained fame on TikTok and became MomTok influencers, and explores the evolving dynamics within their tight-knit community. Cast members Jessi Ngatikaura and Whitney Leavitt discuss the impact of having their lives watched and commented on by millions, and the challenges of maintaining friendships amid drama and filming demands. The show has faced some backlash from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but is praised for its strong aftercare and duty of care standards.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing scrutiny after approving a land law that allows the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensating owners, a move criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump. The government argues the law is necessary to increase black ownership of land, which remains largely in the hands of white people, and that compensation will be paid in most cases. Legal experts say expropriation without compensation would occur only in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or abandoned. The new law aims to make it easier and cheaper to restore land to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule, though its implementation faces political challenges and potential legal challenges.

          <p>Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking with the public. The decision came shortly after the New England Journal of Medicine published an article co-authored by VA pulmonologists warning that cancelled contracts, layoffs, and staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. Veterans advocates view the decision as part of a broader pattern of censorship by the Trump administration.

She says she feels guilty accepting a pardon when she knows she was guilty of unlawful parading. Hemphill's actions stand in contrast to other January 6 defendants who sought copies of their pardons, and she has received assistance from Sen.

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is still fighting to correct what he believes was a "robbery" of his military pension, a battle he has been waging since the 1980s. Williams discovered that he received a significantly lower pension than his brother-in-law, who had a similar service record, because his discharge date was two years earlier, before a change in pension rules. Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from MPs, Williams has been told that his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time. He hopes that by speaking out publicly, he can bring more attention to his case and potentially help other affected veterans. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

Cramer highlights specific examples, including Nvidia, retail stocks, drug stocks, and Apple, where Trump's actions and policies have created uncertainty and reduced valuations. He also notes that even sectors that were previously favored, such as energy, are not benefiting due to regulatory hurdles and lack of clear policy direction.
