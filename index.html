          <p>China's recent military parade showcased a range of advanced weaponry, including new nuclear-capable missiles and futuristic drones, highlighting the success of its modernization strategy. This progress is attributed to a shift in its research and manufacturing ecosystem, which now encourages intense competition between both state-owned and private technology companies. By fostering this competitive environment, particularly in burgeoning fields like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), China has rapidly accelerated the development of diverse and cutting-edge military technology. This approach has allowed for significant leaps in its defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested 890 people at a London demonstration protesting the UK government's ban on the activist group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act, with 17 arrests for assaults on police officers after the protest reportedly turned violent. Organizers from Defend Our Juries dispute the police's characterization, stating protesters were peacefully defying the ban and accusing officers of aggression. The government proscribed Palestine Action in July after activists damaged military aircraft at an RAF base, making support for the group a criminal offense.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A series of high-profile arrests and police actions in the United Kingdom are fueling concerns about a severe erosion of free speech. Critics point to cases such as the arrest of a comedian for online comments, the jailing of a politician's wife for a social media post, and police investigations into journalists and private citizens for their expressed views. These incidents, spanning both Conservative and Labour governments, have led figures like Nigel Farage to warn of an "awful authoritarian situation." The trend has raised alarm on both sides of the Atlantic, with commentators questioning the use of police resources and the state of civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze has achieved massive success, becoming the highest-grossing comic in the country and selling out arenas. In a recent profile, he discusses his journey from being cut from his high school basketball team to hosting the Emmy Awards and starring in his first feature film. Bargatze, known for his family-friendly, "clean comic" style, attributes his success in part to a sense of calling and a desire to provide entertainment that families can enjoy together without concern. Despite his fame, he remains grounded in his Nashville roots and plans to build a larger entertainment world there, including a potential theme park.</p>

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in the game's history, an estimated $1.8 billion, was won on Saturday night by two ticket holders in Texas and Missouri. The winning numbers were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize had grown over three months without a winner, marking a record number of consecutive drawings. The winners will have the choice between an annuity paid over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.

          <p>Leticia, Colombia's only port on the Amazon River, is at risk of being landlocked as drought and sedimentation cause the river to change course, shifting farther into Peruvian territory. This geographical change is exacerbating a long-standing border dispute with Peru, particularly over the island of Santa Rosa, which both nations claim. The potential loss of river access is a critical issue for the isolated Colombian town, which relies on the waterway for trade and supplies. The situation has prompted high-level political protests and has led to the revival of a bilateral border commission to address the escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Five humanitarian aid workers, known as the "Hajnowka Five," are on trial in Poland, accused of human trafficking for assisting an Iraqi-Kurdish family in the border forest with Belarus. This case exemplifies a broader trend of criminalizing aid to migrants, as European Union and Polish officials praise strict border security measures. The prosecution argues the activists deliberately resisted state migration policy, while the defense contends they were saving lives from the illegal and dangerous practice of "pushbacks." The trial has drawn significant media attention, symbolizing the conflict between state security and humanitarian obligations on the EU's eastern frontier.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do for their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development and are linked to better concentration and emotional regulation in older children. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, swaddling, and white noise. He also recommends that both parents get involved in the settling process and maintain a flexible routine to help babies learn to sleep soundly.</p>

Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on complex and vulnerable supply chains, solar panels offer true energy independence by harnessing a readily available resource. The article contrasts the difficulty of storing and sourcing fuels like diesel with the simplicity and long-term reliability of solar panels connected to home batteries. This technology aligns perfectly with a hyper-individualist or conservative desire for self-reliance, making a home a defensible and sustainable castle.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll highlights a sharp partisan split among Americans regarding President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to cities. Supporters, primarily Republicans, believe the action reduces crime and makes them feel safer, and they would endorse similar deployments elsewhere regardless of local leadership. Opponents, largely Democrats, view the move as politically motivated, ineffective at curbing crime, and a threat to civil rights and freedoms. The survey indicates that opinion is more closely tied to political affiliation than to whether respondents live in urban or rural areas.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The decision follows a significant defeat in the July parliamentary election, where the ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house, weakening Ishiba's government. Opponents within the LDP had been calling for his resignation and were set to force an early leadership election, which would have served as a no-confidence vote.

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent use of phrases like "the likes of which nobody's ever seen before" has become a rhetorical signature of his presidency. This analysis suggests the hyperbole is more than a verbal tic; it reflects a worldview where everything is framed in extreme, black-and-white terms, with his successes being historic and national problems being unprecedented crises. Communication experts argue this way of speaking translates directly into his governing style, where extreme contexts are created to justify extreme responses and consolidate power.

While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, issues like grid limitations and intermittent power generation from renewables create instability. In this context, coal-fired power plants act as a crucial 'shock absorber,' providing reliable backup energy to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewable sources are unavailable. This approach allows grid operators the confidence to rapidly approve and integrate vast new renewable projects while maintaining a stable energy supply for the country.</p>

          <p>A new study of sauropod fossils from Brazil reveals that these giant, long-necked dinosaurs were susceptible to a severe bone disease called osteomyelitis approximately 80 million years ago. Researchers found evidence of the destructive infection, caused by pathogens like bacteria or fungi, in the skeletons of six different individuals from the same paleontological site. The bone lesions showed no signs of healing, suggesting the infections were active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor. The findings indicate that the swampy, wet environments preferred by sauropods may have been breeding grounds for pathogens that threatened even the largest of dinosaurs.</p>

Sources indicate that Prince has been aggressively pitching his services in Kyiv, coinciding with a broader influx of Western investors seeking access to Ukraine's battlefield-tested drone technologies. His interest comes as the Trump administration considers using private contractors in a potential postwar scenario. However, Prince faces a damaged reputation within the industry, and Ukrainian drone firms are considered strategic national assets, making any potential sale a sensitive matter.</p>

          <p>The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), William Pulte, is facing scrutiny for his direct and "bizarre" involvement in making a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Former officials and experts note that such investigations are typically handled independently by the agency's Office of Inspector General, not by the director himself, raising questions about political motivation. The referral, which alleges Cook misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage applications, has been used by President Trump as a basis to try to fire her. Pulte has also made similar referrals against other political rivals of Trump.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively encouraging public school students to recite the Christian Lord's Prayer, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious readings. This stance has drawn criticism for its apparent contradiction with his past actions. In 2017, Paxton's office raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Dallas-area school, suggesting it excluded other faiths. Critics argue that his promotion of a specific Christian prayer, while having previously scrutinized Muslim prayer, undermines the constitutional separation of church and state and disrespects religious diversity.</p>

          <p>The New World screwworm, a parasitic fly whose larvae eat the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, is resurging through Central America and approaching the U.S. border, posing a significant threat to the American livestock industry. After being eradicated from the U.S. in the 1960s using a sterile insect technique, a biological barrier at the Panama-Colombia border has held the parasite at bay for decades. However, this barrier has recently failed, allowing the screwworm to spread into Mexico and cause billions in agricultural losses. The USDA is now investing millions to build new sterile-fly production facilities to combat the advancing threat.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has expressed concern about the political "balance" of the UK's Labour cabinet following a reshuffle prompted by Angela Rayner's resignation. Rayner stepped down as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, triggering a contest for the separate role of deputy party leader. Burnham sees this contest as an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and suggested a candidate from the north of England would be beneficial. The reshuffle saw key figures like David Lammy and Yvette Cooper promoted, but the departure of other MPs has fueled debate about the party's ideological direction under Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Despite massive investment and stock market enthusiasm, evidence suggests that Artificial Intelligence is not yet delivering the expected productivity gains, raising fears of an economic bubble. While tech giants pour billions into AI infrastructure, studies show many businesses see no tangible impact on profits, and some tasks, like coding, can even become slower with AI assistance. The article posits that the current economic boom, heavily reliant on AI-related spending, could face a severe correction if investor confidence wanes, potentially leading to a recession. This disconnect between hype and real-world results mirrors past tech bubbles. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Donald Trump's second-term economic strategy increasingly resembles the state-controlled policies of Argentina's Juan Perón. The author points to "import substitution" tactics like high tariffs, direct government intervention in private companies through equity stakes, and attempts to influence the Federal Reserve as parallels to Peronism. The piece warns that centralizing economic decisions in the executive branch, where deals are based on personal connections rather than consistent rules, risks creating an uncompetitive and crony-driven economy. This shift could entrench vested interests dependent on the state, making a return to market capitalism more difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The issue of Palestinian statehood is gaining momentum on the international stage, with several Western nations, including France, Canada, and Australia, announcing their intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This follows recent recognitions by Ireland, Norway, and Spain, reflecting a shift in stance by some of Israel's traditional allies, driven partly by the ongoing war in Gaza. While 147 of 193 UN members already recognize Palestine, full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. The Israeli government has consistently criticized these moves, arguing they reward terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent $1.8 billion jackpot win, an analysis of Powerball data shows that a winner's take-home prize can vary dramatically depending on their state's tax laws. While all winnings are subject to a federal tax of about 37%, some states levy additional income taxes that can significantly reduce the final amount. States like California, Florida, and Texas impose no state tax on lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the maximum amount possible. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, can claim over 10% of the prize, resulting in a substantially smaller payout. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors argued she set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped the flames. After serving nearly nine years of a life sentence, a federal judge overturned her conviction citing an unfair trial, leading to her release. However, prosecutors refiled charges, and in a second trial, she was convicted again based on circumstantial evidence and testimony from her sons, while her daughters maintain her innocence.</p>

The Starbucks Workers United union, which has organized nearly 650 stores, claims that progress has stalled and that Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy has increased demands on understaffed baristas without improving conditions. Despite record union growth, workers criticize the company for failing to bargain in good faith, pointing to stalled wage negotiations and the CEO's exorbitant compensation package as points of contention.</p>

          <p>Health experts are emphasizing the importance of early treatment for hypertension, or high blood pressure, a condition affecting over half of Americans by age 40. Often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms, untreated hypertension is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. New guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Strategies to control blood pressure include a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, limiting alcohol, stress reduction, and, when necessary, various medications to protect long-term health.</p>
