          <p>Asian markets experienced a downturn, while oil prices saw a surge after reports emerged of an Israeli strike on Iran amid escalating tensions over Iran's nuclear program. U.S. benchmark crude oil increased significantly, and Brent crude also saw a notable rise. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Seoul's Kospi both experienced declines, as did Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite Index, with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also drifting lower. On Thursday, U.S. stock indexes had ticked higher following encouraging inflation data, though Boeing experienced a loss after a plane crash in India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military initiated Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and research scientists, prompting Iran to launch over 100 drones in retaliation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the strikes aim to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat, while Iranian state television reported the deaths of key military figures, including Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. U.S. sources confirmed the United States was not involved in the operation, emphasizing the priority of protecting American forces in the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel would continue attacking Iran to eliminate its nuclear program, targeting nuclear fuel production, bomb assembly, and delivery systems. Israel also claimed responsibility for assassinating key nuclear and military personnel inside Iran, including the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. Israel had been contemplating such an attack for two decades, but recent shifts in Iran's political calculations made the timing critical. Iran's immunity from direct attack had been eroded by Israel's actions, weakening its deterrent power and prompting a potential rush to achieve nuclear statehood, leading Israel to act preemptively.</p>

Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require increased public and private investment. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing approximately 60% of the world's supply and processing nearly 90%.</p>

          <p>Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is facing an arrest warrant in Miami-Dade County on charges of attempted murder with a firearm. The charge stems from a May 16 shooting outside a celebrity boxing event, where Brown allegedly punched a man, grabbed a firearm, and fired two shots. The alleged victim reported that one bullet may have grazed his neck, leading to the felony charge requiring a $10,000 bond and house arrest if taken into custody. This incident adds to a growing list of legal troubles for Brown, whose post-NFL career has been marred by erratic behavior and repeated run-ins with the law.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This increase is attributed to various factors, including changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which could be due to adolescents delaying sexual activity or changes in contraceptive practices. The report highlights shifting trends in family planning and societal values.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure for Meta, confirming reports of a $14.3 billion investment from the social networking company. Meta will have a 49% stake in the AI startup but no voting power, while Jason Droege will take over as CEO of Scale AI. Wang's move fits into Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster Meta's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google, with Zuckerberg making AI his company's top priority. Meta's investment and hiring of Wang will not impact Scale AI's customers, and Meta will not have access to its business information or data.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, characterized by the Israeli government as a "preemptive" strike, but which is more accurately described as a preventive war. Israeli spokespeople suggest that these attacks, named Operation Rising Lion, could go on for weeks. While preemptive attacks are considered legitimate under international law when thwarting an imminent attack, preventive wars are viewed as illegal and immoral. The scope of the Israeli offensive, including the reported deaths of senior Iranian leaders, suggests a goal of regime change, carrying immense danger.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily halted a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles, pending the court's consideration of the administration's appeal. A district judge had found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard. The judge said Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service. The appeals court granted an administrative stay in response to the government's emergency motion.</p>

Federal prosecutors are seeking a 12 1/2-year prison term, while Madiganâ€™s attorneys are requesting probation, arguing that imprisonment would effectively be a death sentence for the 83-year-old.

Israeli officials reportedly notified the U.S. before the strikes, which targeted Iran's nuclear program and other military sites.
