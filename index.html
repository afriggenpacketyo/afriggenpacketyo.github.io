          <p>Charles Rangel, a prominent figure in American politics and a longtime U.S. Congressman representing New York City, has passed away at the age of 94; Rangel was a Korean War veteran, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and served 23 terms representing New York's 13th Congressional District. During his tenure, he sponsored 40 bills and resolutions that became law, and he was the first Black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. Despite facing ethics violations and a censure in 2010, Rangel remained a respected and influential leader, affectionately known as "The Lion of Lenox Avenue," and is remembered for his dedication to public service and fighting for equal opportunities.</p>

          <p>With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, particularly by companies like SpaceX, physicists are studying the sounds of spaceflight to understand and address the growing noise pollution; researchers like Kent Gee at Brigham Young University are analyzing sonic booms and other acoustic phenomena generated by rockets. SpaceX is testing Starship, which is likely the loudest rocket ever. This research aims to inform regulations and limits on rocket noise, ensuring that space exploration can continue without causing unacceptable disruptions to communities. The goal is to find ways to lessen the noise impact before it becomes a widespread problem.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who was convicted of federal bribery charges and was scheduled to report to jail; Trump described Jenkins as a victim of the Biden Department of Justice, alleging that the judge in the case refused to allow exculpatory evidence. Jenkins was convicted of conspiracy, honest services fraud, and bribery related to federally funded programs, stemming from a scheme where he received over $75,000 for appointing individuals as auxiliary deputy sheriffs; the Justice Department argued that Jenkins had violated public trust by exploiting his position for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Peter Orszag, former budget director under President Obama, expresses increasing concern over the deteriorating fiscal situation of the United States, citing rising federal budget deficits and interest rates. He notes that interest payments now exceed spending on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare, and projects unprecedented debt levels by 2029. While acknowledging the dollar's status as the global reserve currency provides some buffer, Orszag argues that reduced appetite for U.S. debt among foreign investors could drive interest rates higher. He recommends eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and generating fiscal savings in entitlement programs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set three of its mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, viewing it as a check on the state's outsize influence and what they see as an impractical and liberal agenda. For over half a century, California has been allowed to set its own stringent pollution limits, which many other Democratic-led states have adopted. Republicans argue that electric vehicles are unsuitable for rural areas and that California's policies should not dictate choices for the rest of the country. Governor Newsom said the state would fight in court to preserve its autonomy in setting emissions rules.</p>

He is urging President Trump and Harvard's president to reach an agreement, emphasizing the importance of retaining international students for America's future economic success.

          <p>King Charles III visited Canada amid tensions with U.S. President Trump, who had suggested the United States annex its northern neighbor. The visit, at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, underscored Canada's sovereignty, with the King delivering the speech from the throne to outline the government's agenda. Carney emphasized the visit's significance in light of the enduring tradition and friendship between Canada and the Crown, as well as the vitality of Canada's constitutional monarchy and its distinct identity.

          <p>President Trump's recent comments on the Gaza conflict, calling for a swift resolution, reflect a growing impatience among Israel's allies with the ongoing war; countries like the United States, Britain, France, and Germany are becoming more vocal in their criticism of Israel's actions, particularly the expanded attacks in Gaza. This shift comes after months of intense global criticism of Israel's conduct in the war. Despite these criticisms, many of these countries continue to provide support to Israel, though they also express concern about the humanitarian situation and the need for a cease-fire.</p>

Despite expressing shock at the violence, Trump has not altered his stance on refusing to join Europe in implementing new financial sanctions or providing additional aid to Ukraine. This pattern has drawn criticism from experts who say Trump is not willing to make Putin pay a price for his actions. While Trump claims he is considering sanctions, he has repeatedly refrained from imposing economic penalties on Russia.</p>

The EU seeks to reduce existing tariffs and proposes a "zero-for-zero" strategy, but the path to de-escalation remains uncertain.

It notes that the Trump administration's efforts to undercut electric vehicle growth and favor oil echo historical trends, and also highlights the impact of gender stereotypes on the adoption of electric vehicles.
