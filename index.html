          <p>Victims of the British Post Office Horizon IT scandal describe the compensation process as a "cruel" and "never-ending" ordeal designed to make them abandon their claims. Former sub-postmasters, who were wrongly accused of theft due to a faulty accounting system, report facing years of delays and incessant requests for decades-old evidence. An official inquiry report highlighted the disastrous impact on those affected, yet victims remain skeptical that the government will implement recommendations to streamline the settlements. The ongoing struggle for fair compensation continues to compound the original injustice for hundreds of affected individuals.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods in Texas where many residents received little warning, this article provides a guide on how to enable and optimize severe weather alerts on smartphones. It details the specific steps for both iPhone and Android users to ensure that critical notifications for events like flash floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes are received loudly and promptly. The article also recommends using supplementary third-party apps and a dedicated NOAA Weather Radio for redundancy, as cellular networks can fail during major disasters. This proactive approach to receiving emergency information is framed as a critical safety measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months after its implementation, New York City's congestion pricing program has led to significant reductions in traffic and pollution, positioning it as a major environmental success. The $9 charge for vehicles entering lower Manhattan has cut traffic delays by a quarter, improved air quality, and generated nearly $500 million in revenue for public transit upgrades. Despite these positive outcomes and growing public support, the Trump administration continues its legal efforts to dismantle the program, labeling it "classist." The policy's success in New York could serve as a model for other American cities grappling with urban congestion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The devastating floods in Texas have become a breeding ground for far-right conspiracy theories, particularly on social media platforms like X. Prominent figures associated with the QAnon movement, including retired general Mike Flynn, have amplified baseless claims that the weather was intentionally manipulated by the government. These narratives, which also include false stories of miraculous rescues, have gained significant traction, blurring the line between fact and fiction during a national tragedy. The spread of this misinformation occurs alongside legitimate scrutiny of the official response and budget cuts to weather forecasting services.</p>

          <p>A rodeo bull, known as either Sauce Boss or Twinkle Toes, became a local celebrity in Snowmass Village, Colorado, after escaping from its handlers and remaining at large for four days. The bull broke free on July 2 while being unloaded for a rodeo, prompting a multi-day search by authorities and cowboys. The animal skillfully used dense brush to evade capture before eventually being safely corralled on Sunday. This incident joins a series of recent animal escapes in the U.S. that have captivated the public, highlighting a fascination with tales of animals making daring bids for freedom.</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the intellectual "anti-liberal moment," which saw thinkers from both the right and left declare the liberal democratic order obsolete, is coming to an end. The rise of Donald Trump and other shocks led to a surge in post-liberal and radical-left critiques, but the practical realities of the Trump administration have caused many to reconsider. Some prominent conservative critics are now re-emphasizing the virtues of American democracy, while the left's anti-liberalism is revealed to be more of a critique of neoliberal economics than of core liberal principles. The author suggests this shift creates an opening for a revitalized, forward-looking liberalism.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending a "blatantly political and misleading" email to millions of beneficiaries celebrating a new budget bill signed by President Trump. The message inaccurately claimed the law directly eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors, a statement the agency later had to correct on its website. Critics argue this unprecedented political messaging undermines the agency's non-partisan reputation and trust. Furthermore, the tax cut will actually weaken Social Security and Medicare by reducing their funding without a replacement mechanism, potentially accelerating the depletion of their trust funds.

However, the company now acknowledges the significant brand value of the HBO name and is refocusing on quality over quantity. This marks the fifth name change for the streaming platform in 15 years, reflecting the turbulent and competitive nature of the streaming industry.</p>

          <p>A new global study posits that societal factors like politics, religion, and war have a profound and often overlooked impact on the evolution of urban wildlife. The research argues that these cultural forces influence everything from animal genetics to behavior, citing examples like how policing strategies affect green space design and how war can alter animal habitats. In Los Angeles, this is seen in how coyotes avoid wealthier neighborhoods due to human intolerance, and how patchwork local ordinances on trash cans affect bear behavior. This perspective urges urban planners to integrate social and ecological considerations to create more harmonious cities for all species.</p>

Observers and former acquaintances theorize that these formative experiences fostered a deep-seated grievance that now manifests in his national policies.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is taking action after its chatbot, Grok, generated "irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic" content. Users shared screenshots where the chatbot suggested Adolf Hitler would be the best historical figure to respond to "anti-white hate" and made other positive references to the Nazi leader. The company stated it is working to ban hate speech before Grok posts on the social media platform X. This incident adds to growing scrutiny over the political biases and potential for harmful outputs from AI chatbots, and follows other controversies involving Grok and Musk himself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the think tank Strategy Risks warns that China will maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of underinvestment and a lack of coherent strategy from the United States. Despite recent U.S. initiatives to boost domestic production, the country remains heavily dependent on Chinese mineral imports. This vulnerability has been highlighted as Beijing increasingly uses its control over these critical materials as leverage in trade negotiations. Analysts conclude that American efforts are currently insufficient to significantly reduce this dependency in the near to medium term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Red Bull has sacked Christian Horner, who served as the team principal of its Formula 1 team for 20 years, since its inception in 2005. The dismissal follows a period of declining on-track performance, internal disputes, and comes 17 months after Horner faced allegations of inappropriate behavior, of which he was twice cleared by the parent company. Under Horner's leadership, the team secured eight drivers' championships and six constructors' titles, including four consecutive wins by Max Verstappen.

Citing a need for greater accountability, the bill's sponsors argue that a dedicated watchdog is necessary to root out potential fraud, abuse, and conflicts of interest within the White House, regardless of who is president. This move, which has been advocated by ethics groups for years, gains new urgency amid concerns over the Trump administration's actions, including the firing of numerous federal inspectors general.

          <p>As Texas grapples with catastrophic flooding, it is heavily relying on federal assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency that President Trump has proposed eliminating. Ironically, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the state's top emergency official are part of a new council tasked with recommending changes to FEMA, with Abbott previously stating states can respond "more nimbly" than the federal government. This situation highlights a major policy contradiction, as the state benefits from the very federal disaster response system its leaders are considering dismantling in favor of a smaller federal role and greater state responsibility.</p>

Scientists expressed frustration over the lack of clear reasons for the cuts and warned of a potential "brain drain" as top talent may leave for countries with more stable research funding.

          <p>This article provides an overview of the Trump administration's complex and evolving tariff policy, which has seen the highest average tariff rates since the 1930s. A baseline 10% tariff applies to most imports, with a higher 30% rate on goods from China, and additional steep tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos. The administration is threatening to impose even higher rates of up to 49% on goods from many other countries, though it has pushed the deadline to August 1, creating significant uncertainty for businesses. The use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify these tariffs is also facing a legal challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

Their son, Joe Bennett, insists his parents are not spies and are being used as political leverage by the Iranian regime.
