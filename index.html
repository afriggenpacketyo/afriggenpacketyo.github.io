          <h2>Chinese Energy Investments in Africa Increasingly Focused on Renewables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 02:00:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by ODI Global reveals that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, as exports surged 153% from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's energy investment moving away from fossil fuels to renewables, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. Elena Kiryakova from ODI Global attributes this trend to the global competitiveness of Chinese tech and Africa's growing energy requirements.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East to secure investment, trade, and technology deals from Gulf leaders, focusing on oil, trade, and regional conflicts, including the Israel-Gaza war. Trump aims to emphasize his 'America First' policy by securing multi-billion dollar deals, with Saudi Arabia already committing to invest $1 trillion into the US economy. Discussions will also involve access to advanced US semiconductor exports and Saudi Arabia's interest in civilian nuclear infrastructure, with the administration indicating that these issues are no longer tied to the country's normalization of relations with Israel. The article notes the absence of plans to visit Israel, highlighting tensions between the US and Israel regarding the Gaza conflict.</p>

New government plans aim to prevent foreign criminals from exploiting human rights laws to avoid deportation, marking the biggest overhaul of immigration laws since Brexit. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper states that the new rules are essential to regain control of immigration and end the chaos left by previous administrations.</p>

Drummond is returning to the plan that helped her lose over 50 pounds in 2021, focusing on building muscle through lunges, squats, and deadlifts, and increasing her protein intake. She is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying on the awareness of portion sizes she gained previously.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why many individuals are secretly using weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro, even from close family and friends. The reasons range from fear of judgment and the perception of 'cheating' to shame about being overweight in the first place. Many feel pressure to hide their use of these drugs due to the cultural narrative that weight loss should involve hard work and sacrifice, while using medication is seen as an easy way out. Clinical psychologist Gail Bohin emphasizes that this secrecy is tied to a weight-stigmatizing culture where people are seen as personally responsible for their weight.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump’s trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Trump has hinted at lowering tariffs to 80% if China makes concessions, while China has remained firm in its stance against making trade concessions. Economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal, but Trump appears poised to tout any concessions as a win for the United States.</p>

Ross criticizes the tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers for their children’s problems and encourages mothers to recognize that they are good enough. She also provides a lighthearted quiz to help mothers acknowledge and embrace their imperfections.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey on May 15, without preconditions, after European leaders threatened “new and massive” sanctions if Russia did not agree to a 30-day cease-fire. The European leaders, including those from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, made their demand during a joint visit to Ukraine. Putin's proposal did not directly address the European call for a cease-fire, and Ukraine reported drone attacks shortly after Putin's announcement.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf, a move that has drawn condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The name 'Persian Gulf' has historical significance dating back to ancient Persia, and Iranians view it as a core part of their national identity. Trump's proposal has united Iranians of all factions in opposition, with many expressing outrage and vowing to defend the traditional name. The article also explores the potential implications of this move on ongoing Iran-U.S. nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's push for Europe to import more American farm products, particularly beef and chicken, is facing strong resistance due to differing food safety standards. European officials consider their food regulations, especially those related to health and safety, a 'red line' in trade negotiations. The U.S. argues that American meat, produced without similar regulations, is superior, but Europeans prioritize hormone-free and locally sourced products. The article highlights the cultural and economic factors behind Europe's protectionist stance on food, including the prevalence of smaller family farms and consumer preferences for traditional farming methods.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article profiles Jorgen Boassen, a fervent supporter of President Trump in Greenland, whose idolization has made him an unlikely political influencer. Despite facing hostility at home for his pro-Trump stance, Boassen has gained attention in Washington and is now working to strengthen ties between Greenland and the United States. He advocates for an independent Greenland with a tight security alliance with Washington, distinguishing himself from Trump's desire to claim the island for the U.S. Boassen's journey from bricklayer to political player highlights the growing geopolitical importance of the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, brokered after U.S.-led talks, quickly unraveled as both countries accused each other of violations. Despite President Trump's announcement of a 'full and immediate ceasefire,' explosions and gunfire were reported along the Line of Control in Kashmir. The agreement followed weeks of escalating clashes triggered by a tourist site attack that India blamed on Pakistan. While officials from both sides initially agreed to halt military action, reports of continued shelling and blackouts raised doubts about the truce's sustainability.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed a unique algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to perform autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in intense flight missions. The breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, highlights the potential for drones to execute high-risk maneuvers previously considered unstable. This technology draws inspiration from nature, where aerial acrobatics are essential for species like sparrowhawks and bats to hunt or avoid obstacles. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasizes that this research redefines traditional drone flight paradigms by transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards'.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed reservations regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about the potential impact on state coffers. Senior officials in his administration have also been dismissive of the idea, as the government prepares an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election. Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions on alternative ways to support those in need and questioned the financial implications of a tax cut. He also stated that Japan will continue to seek the complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Rubber Duck Museum, located in Point Roberts, Washington, is relocating to Canada due to the impact of tariffs on goods from China and strained relations between the U.S. and Canada. Owners Neil and Krystal King cite a significant decline in Canadian visitors, who make up a large portion of their customer base. With tariffs on Chinese-made rubber ducks reaching 145%, the Kings found it unsustainable to continue operating in the U.S. The move allows them to avoid tariffs and continue serving their loyal Canadian customers.</p>
