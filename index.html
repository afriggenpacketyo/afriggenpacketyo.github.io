          <p>The gunman responsible for the Midtown Manhattan mass shooting, Shane Tamura, was found to have low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), according to the New York City medical examiner. Tamura, a former high school football player, killed four people and himself, leaving notes referencing the brain disease and asking for his brain to be studied. While experts caution that CTE does not explain such violent behavior, the finding highlights the ongoing discussion about the risks of head injuries in contact sports, even at the amateur level. The article explains that CTE is a degenerative disease linked to repeated head trauma, causing behavioral changes and cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a prominent 70-year-old former bond trader, and his ex-assistant were arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges Rubin operated a trafficking network, spending over $1 million to bring women to a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse where they were subjected to non-consensual and brutalizing sexual acts. This arrest follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking six women. Rubin was previously known for his role in a major trading loss at Merrill Lynch detailed in the book "Liar's Poker."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for home equity loans have decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. A new analysis shows that a $150,000 home equity loan now has lower monthly payments compared to earlier this year and the previous year, potentially saving borrowers thousands over the loan's term. The article provides specific cost breakdowns for 10- and 15-year loans, highlighting how changes in the federal funds rate influence consumer borrowing costs. It suggests that with more rate cuts potentially on the horizon, homeowners may find even better terms soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return over 28,000 fossils, including the historically significant "Java Man" bones, to Indonesia. This collection, named after Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois who excavated them in 1891 during the colonial era, contains the first known fossils of Homo erectus. The decision follows a recommendation from the Dutch Independent Colonial Collections Committee, which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return culturally significant artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has admitted to accepting bribes in exchange for promoting pro-Russian narratives while he was a Member of the European Parliament. Gill pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery, acknowledging he received money from Oleg Voloshyn, a Ukrainian figure linked to Russian intelligence, between 2018 and 2019. In return, he made supportive speeches in parliament, gave statements to a pro-Russian TV channel, and organized events with allied politicians. The illicit activities were discovered through WhatsApp messages on his phone after he was stopped at Manchester Airport under counter-terrorism laws.</p>

          <p>Actress Natalie Dormer, who portrays Sarah Ferguson in an upcoming drama, has announced she will not participate in promoting the show and will donate her salary to charities for abuse survivors. Her decision comes after a 2011 email surfaced in which Ferguson called Jeffrey Epstein a "supreme friend," contradicting her public pledge to sever ties with the disgraced financier. In her statement, Dormer explained that the new information makes it impossible to reconcile her values with Ferguson's behavior, which she deemed inexcusable. The controversy has already led several charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, to drop Ferguson as a patron.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist who was on the FBI's "most wanted terrorists" list, has died in Cuba at the age of 78. The Cuban government announced her death, stating it was due to health conditions and advanced age. Shakur, born Joanne Deborah Byron, was convicted in the 1970s for the killing of a New Jersey state trooper, a charge she and her supporters always maintained was unjust. She escaped from a U.S. prison in 1979 and was granted political asylum in Cuba, where she lived in exile until her death, remaining a significant and controversial figure in American activism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 regarding his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. Prosecutors allege Comey misled Congress about authorizing leaks to the media, a claim disputed by some Republicans who cite conflicting accounts from his former deputy. The indictment comes just before the statute of limitations was set to expire and follows public calls from President Trump for Comey's prosecution, raising concerns about political influence within the Justice Department.</p>

The ball, potentially worth six figures, was then returned to Raleigh by Marcus in exchange for a signed bat, as the young fan felt the memorabilia meant more to the player.

          <p>Following a UN declaration that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, there are growing calls for the country to be suspended from international football, with a potential UEFA vote on the matter looming. The Turkish Football Association has formally demanded a ban, and many other nations are reportedly pushing for action, though UEFA's leadership has previously resisted such measures. The decision rests with UEFA's 20-member executive committee, but any suspension would also need ratification from FIFA. The situation is complicated by strong U.S. opposition to a ban, creating a potential diplomatic clash between the governing bodies ahead of the World Cup.</p>

Such a large-scale, short-notice gathering is highly unusual, and the Pentagon has not disclosed the specific agenda, leading to speculation. The meeting comes as Hegseth pursues a plan to reduce the number of high-ranking general and flag officers by 20%, a goal he has publicly discussed since taking office. Other theories suggest the meeting could be to unveil the new National Defense Strategy, which is expected to focus more on homeland defense and border operations.</p>

The FAA had stripped Boeing of this authority for the MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production flaws. Under the new arrangement, the FAA and Boeing will alternate issuing the certificates, a move the agency says is based on confidence in Boeing's improved production quality. This decision signals a significant step in the manufacturer's recovery, though the FAA maintains a production cap on the 737 MAX.</p>

          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. This approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs, balancing financial security with flexibility. While this method can reduce stress during market volatility, retirees should consider the trade-offs, including the illiquidity of the annuity portion and the continued market risk for the invested funds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" residency program with a price of $1 million, a significant reduction from the initially proposed $5 million. This move has made the U.S. visa one of the most competitively priced "golden visas" globally, sparking immediate and high demand from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India, according to immigration attorneys. The program, which promises residency in record time, aims to raise federal revenue by issuing up to 80,000 cards. However, it faces legal hurdles as it uses executive workarounds of existing immigration law, which may lead to court challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

This review follows the easing of restrictions in 2023 that allowed the pill to be prescribed via telehealth and mail. While advocates for abortion access maintain the drug has an exceptional safety record confirmed by over 100 studies, the review could potentially lead to renewed restrictions on its availability.</p>
