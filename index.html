          <p>Over 3,000 individuals in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos. The lawsuit, valued at over £1 billion, claims the company knew about the risks for decades but continued to sell the product. Johnson & Johnson has faced thousands of similar lawsuits in the U.S. and maintains its products are safe, while a subsidiary now handles these international claims. The case highlights long-standing concerns about the safety of talc-based products.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old Norwegian man, formerly a security guard at the U.S. Embassy in Oslo, has been convicted of espionage and sentenced to over three years in prison. Prosecutors alleged he provided Russia and Iran with sensitive information, including details about embassy diplomats, floor plans, and security protocols. The man's defense argued the information shared was worthless and that he exaggerated his access. The conviction raises questions about the definition of espionage under Norwegian law.</p>

The key disagreement remains over Democrats' insistence on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which Republicans want to address separately after reopening the government. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly urged President Trump to intervene in negotiations to help break the legislative impasse.

          <p>The European Union is advancing a "defense readiness roadmap" that includes the creation of a comprehensive anti-drone defense system, dubbed a "drone wall," to be operational by 2027. The initiative is a response to increasing airspace encroachments by Russian unmanned aerial vehicles, highlighting the changing nature of modern warfare. Top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas emphasized that drone defenses are now essential for all member states. The plan also involves fortifying the EU's eastern borders and exploring integrated air and space shields.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated his determination to secure the return of the remaining 19 deceased hostages from Gaza, following a ceasefire deal. His comments came after Hamas returned the bodies of two more individuals but claimed it could not access the others. The delay has caused anger in Israel, with threats to restrict aid to Gaza, though U.S. officials have downplayed it as a breach of the agreement. The situation remains tense as both sides navigate the fragile terms of the ceasefire.</p>

This development follows federal agents searching Bolton's home and office in August related to information in his 2019 memoir. Bolton has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating that he did not unlawfully remove classified materials or include them in his book.

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, confirmed that American personnel will help in the recovery efforts, which include two U.S. nationals. Hamas has stated it lacks the specialized equipment needed to retrieve the bodies from the widespread destruction, a claim U.S. officials are treating with patience for now.

          <p>A coalition of over 50 anti-human trafficking organizations has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that its executive orders banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives undermine a key anti-trafficking law. The complaint alleges that the Department of Justice has barred the use of words like "race," "gender," and "discrimination" in federally funded work, crippling their ability to address systemic issues that make certain populations more vulnerable to trafficking. The lawsuit claims these restrictions amount to unlawful censorship and harm the ability to advocate for survivors, a disproportionate number of whom are minorities and LGBTQ+ people.</p>

However, Pensana's chairman stated that artificially low prices maintained by China and insufficient UK government support made the project economically unviable. The decision is a setback for the UK's critical minerals strategy, while the U.S. is offering more substantial financial incentives for similar projects.</p>
