          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn in a boxing match marked by intense personal drama and a bloodline feud dating back to their fathers' rivalry in the 1990s. The fight, held at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, saw Eubank emerge victorious after 12 grueling rounds, with emotions running high for both fighters. The rivalry had been reignited after Benn failed a drugs test in 2022, leading to the cancellation of their originally scheduled bout. Despite the animosity, Benn acknowledged the importance of family, stating that the fight's outcome, if it brought Chris and his father closer, was invaluable.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the increasing autocracy in Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, highlighting his consolidation of power, control over the courts, and manipulation of elections. The recent detention of Ekrem Imamoglu, a potential presidential opponent, and his associates is seen as a significant escalation. The article criticizes the weak international response and calls for greater support for the Turkish people and increased pressure on Erdogan to uphold democratic principles. The author suggests that democracies are not properly weighing the trade-offs of their relationship with Turkey.</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic passenger Colonel Archibald Gracie days before the ship's sinking sold for £300,000 at auction, exceeding expectations. The letter, written on April 10, 1912, the day Gracie boarded the Titanic, contains a poignant reference to awaiting his "journey's end" before judging the ship. The letter was purchased by an anonymous buyer at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire, UK, and it is now considered a very rare and valuable artifact from the historic voyage.</p>
