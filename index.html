          <p>The UK, particularly South-east England and East Anglia, is expected to experience temperatures reaching 26-27C on the last day of spring. There's a possibility of temperatures rising to 29C in some areas, potentially surpassing the year's highest temperature recorded on May 1st. The weather will be warm and humid across England and Wales, with eastern counties of England likely to have the highest temperatures. Spring has already been confirmed as the sunniest on record, with temperature and rainfall levels near record-breaking levels as well, marking a notable end to the season.</p>

          <p>The A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened after 23 years of roadworks and a Â£2bn upgrade. Initially drawn up in 1990, the project aimed to improve travel times and bring prosperity to a deprived area. The upgrade involved constructing nearly 70 structures, including bridges and junctions, and planting 285,000 trees to offset environmental impact. The final stretch was financed using the Mutual Investment Model, with the Welsh government paying over Â£40m annually for 30 years for maintenance until 2055; the project has faced criticism over its cost and delays.</p>

          <p>Christopher Winslow, director of Ohio Sea Grant and Stone Laboratory, will lead a community lecture at The Ohio State University at Marion on June 10, focusing on Lake Erie. The lecture, part of the Buckeye Talks on Tap series, will address nutrient sources affecting the lake, including agricultural runoff and best management practices. Winslow will also discuss strategies for reducing phosphorus levels by 40% and identify gaps in current research. The event aims to engage the community in a conversation about the crucial role Lake Erie plays in Ohio's economy and as a drinking water source.</p>

          <p>Sperm from a single European donor has been linked to cancer diagnoses in 10 children conceived through assisted reproduction. The donor carried a rare genetic variant, TP53, which causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, increasing cancer risk. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the presence of the variant, which was undetectable by standard screening methods at the time of donation. The research identified 67 children from 46 families across Europe, with 23 carrying the mutation; the sperm bank advocates for internationally binding family limits for sperm donors and stated that donor-assisted reproduction remains a safe alternative to natural conception.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that the United Nations may be undercounting the world's population by hundreds of millions, or even billions, due to incomplete census data in rural areas. While some express concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity, others argue that these anxieties reflect power struggles over who is considered a burden or threat. The article discusses historical perspectives on population growth and control, including coercive policies in India and China. It concludes that managing consumption responsibly and developing sustainable technologies are crucial for avoiding environmental catastrophe, and that concerns about population are often rooted in biases about certain groups of people.</p>

          <p>Meta is planning to replace human reviewers with AI for up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. This shift aims to accelerate product development, but current and former employees worry that AI may not adequately address potential real-world harms. While Meta claims that human expertise will still be used for complex issues, internal documents suggest that even sensitive areas like AI safety and youth risk may be automated. Critics fear that this move could lead to less rigorous scrutiny and increased risks for users, despite Meta's investment in user privacy.</p>

Critics argue that the agreements lack clarity and specificity, potentially violating ethical rules and federal bribery statutes. Meanwhile, law firms challenging Trump's actions in court have been successful, further highlighting the questionable nature of these deals and their broader consequences for the legal profession.</p>

The review warns of emerging threats, including drones and artificial intelligence, and recommends deploying digital experts alongside troops. While acknowledging Russia as an immediate danger and China as a persistent challenge, the government's budget watchdog estimates an additional Â£17.3 billion will be needed by 2029-30 to meet the 3% target.</p>

The incident, witnessed by Kim Jong Un, has been deemed a "criminal act," and officials are working to repair the ship before a late-June plenary session. Analysts suggest the balloons may prevent further flooding or reduce stress on the damaged portion of the ship.</p>
