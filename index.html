          <p>SAP experienced a significant surge in shares, climbing over 10%, following a robust first-quarter earnings report that exceeded analysts' expectations. The company reported a 58% year-over-year increase in operating profit, driven by strong cloud revenue growth. CEO Christian Klein highlighted the resilience of SAP's software amid global tariff uncertainty, emphasizing its role in helping businesses manage complex supply chains. The company has upgraded its full-year outlook for 2025 back in January, after its adjusted operating profit rose 25% to 8.15 billion euros in full-year 2024. The growth in SAP's cloud unit gave the company "a lot of predictability."</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced volatility after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the oil major. Elliott's involvement has fueled speculation that BP might shift its focus back to oil and gas, deviating from its green strategy. BP subsequently announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a strategic shift. This decision followed a drop in fourth-quarter profits and pressure from investors concerned about both revenue and climate goals. Since switching gears, BP's CEO Murray Auchincloss and outgoing Chair Helge Lund retained their posts but were penalized with reduced support during BP's board re-election vote earlier this month amid pressure from both revenue and climate-focused investors.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a decline in international tourist arrivals, while American citizens are traveling abroad in increasing numbers. Data reveals a nearly 10% drop in foreign visitors to the U.S. by air in March compared to the previous year, while U.S. citizens flying abroad increased by 1.6%. This imbalance is widening the gap between U.S. revenue from travel and tourism services and American spending overseas. Factors contributing to the decline in international tourism include trade tensions, detentions of visitors, and a strong U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in a Berlin housing estate has raised concerns among tenants about the responsiveness of housing companies during health crises. Residents claim their landlord failed to adequately inform them about the contamination and implement containment measures promptly. One tenant believes she contracted Legionnaires' before being notified of the outbreak. The incident has highlighted broader issues with affordable housing maintenance and communication between landlords and tenants in major cities. The special water filters have reduced water pressure to a mere drip.</p>

At least three Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers were found on the hanger deck. One plane was still fully armed, with a bomb secured in its release cradle.

The case highlights the escalating tension between the executive branch and the courts over judicial orders. The US supreme court ordered the Trump administration nearly two weeks ago to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US from a notorious Salvadorian prison, rejecting the White House’s claim that it couldn’t retrieve him despite the administration having admitted previously in court that it had sent him out of the country by mistake.</p>
