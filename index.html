          <h2>Pro-Trump Voices Shift to Defend President After Critical Wall Street Journal Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 13:56:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key supporters of President Trump have shifted from criticizing his handling of the Epstein files to rallying in his defense. This change followed a Wall Street Journal article alleging a past connection, which Trump strongly denies and is now suing the paper over. The pivot was further solidified by Trump's subsequent call to release grand jury testimony related to the case, a move that was praised by figures in his base who had previously been critical. The article questions whether this renewed unity will last, as the release process could be lengthy and may not satisfy all demands for transparency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author Amy Odell claims that during their relationship in the 1990s, Gwyneth Paltrow harbored doubts about her then-fiancé, Brad Pitt. The book alleges that Paltrow felt she was more educated and sophisticated than Pitt, a sentiment rooted in their significantly different upbringings. Odell writes that Paltrow expressed these concerns to a crew member while filming and even admitted to having a crush on actor Hugh Grant at the time. The couple met in 1993, became engaged in 1996, and ultimately ended their relationship in 1997.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Formally Requests Release of Epstein Grand Jury Testimony</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 13:43:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant public and bipartisan political pressure, the Trump administration has formally requested that a federal judge unseal the grand jury testimony connected to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Pam Bondi filed a motion citing the intense public interest in the Justice Department's investigation. This action represents a shift for President Trump, who had previously dismissed interest in the files as a politically motivated "hoax." The call for greater transparency has been a rare point of agreement, with lawmakers from both parties viewing it as crucial for restoring public trust.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they take place as soon as next week. The stated goal is to accelerate the negotiation process and make tangible progress towards achieving a ceasefire. This diplomatic initiative occurs even as Ukraine continues to endure intense military assaults from Russian forces. In a separate development, Ukraine also accused Russia of weaponizing deportations after it had to evacuate 43 of its citizens who were abandoned without documents near the Georgian border.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched another large-scale overnight air assault on Ukraine, with strikes reported across ten different regions that resulted in at least three fatalities. According to Ukraine's military, the bombardment involved over 340 drones and 35 missiles. Although many of the projectiles were reportedly intercepted, successful strikes hit a residential building in the southern city of Odesa and caused significant damage to critical infrastructure in Pavlohrad and Sumy. President Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for enhanced air defense capabilities as Russia continues to intensify its attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic escalation, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered the revocation of U.S. visas for eight of Brazil's eleven Supreme Court judges. This action is part of a broader White House campaign to support former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently facing prosecution over an alleged coup attempt. Brazilian President Lula da Silva strongly condemned the move as "unacceptable interference" and an "affront to national sovereignty." The visa cancellations follow President Trump's recent threat to impose 50% tariffs on all Brazilian imports, further heightening tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Early Earnings Reports Suggest Nuanced View of Corporate Performance is Needed</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The initial wave of second-quarter corporate earnings reports underscores the importance of looking beyond immediate, knee-jerk market reactions. For example, Wells Fargo's stock initially fell on a lowered net interest income outlook but recovered as investors recognized the company's strategic focus on more predictable fee-based revenue. Similarly, BlackRock's stock dropped after its report but quickly rebounded to a new high as the market digested the positive long-term implications of a major acquisition. These cases suggest that initial stock movements may not accurately reflect a company's full quarterly performance or future prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This collection of essays from The Atlantic delves into the complex and often idealized reality of family vacations, cautioning that they are not a panacea for life's underlying tensions. One piece explores the personal realization that a trip cannot fundamentally change a person's core nature or family dynamics. Another article examines the growing trend of multi-generational travel and how it can reveal new and unexpected dimensions of family relationships. A third offers practical rules for a happier vacation, such as detailed planning and resisting the pressure to post on social media.</p>

          <p>A federal filing from April revealed that Elon Musk's neurotechnology company, Neuralink, was registered with the U.S. Small Business Administration as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB). This designation is intended for companies majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The registration occurred shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson has since stated that the box on the form was checked erroneously, has been corrected, and that the company never sought or received any federal benefits.</p>

The dam is being built on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, a crucial waterway that flows downstream into India and Bangladesh, where it is known as the Brahmaputra River. The project has raised significant alarm in these downstream countries, particularly India, over concerns about water security, environmental impact, and geopolitical leverage. The plan is a key part of China's broader strategy to exploit the region's hydropower resources.</p>

          <p>A driver deliberately smashed his car into a large crowd outside the Vermont Hollywood nightclub early Saturday morning, injuring 30 people, with seven of them listed in critical condition. Police officials report that the act appeared to be intentional, as the driver, who had allegedly been ejected from the club for being intoxicated, made a U-turn before plowing into a taco stand and people waiting in line. In the chaotic aftermath, bystanders pulled the driver from his vehicle, and he was subsequently shot by an unknown assailant before being taken to the hospital.</p>

          <p>This analysis delves into the significant legal, market, and economic consequences that could unfold if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legally, the move would be unprecedented and would almost certainly trigger a lengthy court battle to determine if Trump has the necessary "cause" for removal. Economically, such an action could severely undermine the Fed's independence, potentially leading to higher inflation expectations and increased long-term interest rates, which would paradoxically work against Trump's stated goal of lowering borrowing costs. The article notes the constant political pressure itself creates significant uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway contends that the worst piece of career advice, often given by the ultra-wealthy, is to "follow your passion." He argues this is a luxury that only the already-rich can truly afford. Instead, Galloway advises people to find the practical intersection of what they are genuinely good at and what can be profitable in the marketplace. He emphasizes that success is more often the result of enduring rejection and being willing to pivot when necessary, rather than blindly pursuing a passion without regard for its financial viability.</p>

          <p>Tanning is experiencing a cultural resurgence, evolving beyond a simple aesthetic choice to become part of a broader, anti-establishment health ideology. This "new sun worship" is increasingly popular in alternative-health and some right-wing political circles that actively question mainstream medical guidance on sun avoidance and sunscreen. Proponents, including figures nominated for roles in the Trump administration, emphasize sunlight's natural benefits while downplaying or spreading conspiracy theories about the well-documented risks of skin cancer. The trend reflects a growing public distrust of scientific institutions and established health guidance.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), which serves as the agency's primary scientific branch. This move is part of a major restructuring that will also see the agency's total workforce reduced by nearly 23%, or more than 3,700 employees. Critics, including union leaders and Democratic lawmakers, have warned that dismantling the EPA's scientific foundation will have devastating and long-lasting impacts on public and environmental health.

          <p>The United Kingdom is currently under widespread yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, bringing a continued threat of flash flooding, power outages, and significant travel disruption. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast on Saturday morning did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared, localized impacts remain a distinct possibility. These weather alerts cover all four nations and are expected to extend into Monday. The recent heatwave has left the ground exceptionally dry, increasing the risk of surface runoff and flooding from the forecast downpours.</p>
