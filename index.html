          <p>Former federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, who is the daughter of ex-FBI Director James Comey, is suing the Justice Department over her termination. The lawsuit alleges her firing was unlawful, unconstitutional, and politically motivated, stemming from her father's public conflicts with President Trump. Comey, who worked on high-profile cases and received outstanding performance reviews, was dismissed without cause or explanation just after being assigned a major public corruption case. She is seeking reinstatement and protection from further adverse actions without due process.</p>

          <p>Cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave saw its shares surge after disclosing a substantial order from Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. The agreement obligates Nvidia to purchase any of CoreWeave's unsold capacity through April 2032, highlighting the deep partnership between the two companies. This development comes as CoreWeave, which relies heavily on Nvidia's GPUs for its AI-focused services, continues to experience rapid revenue growth despite ongoing net losses. The company's stock has tripled since its IPO, pushing its valuation over $58 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed that the SEC replace mandatory quarterly corporate earnings reports with a semi-annual requirement, a change he argues would save money and encourage long-term strategic planning over short-term profit chasing. The idea, which has been debated for years, has gained renewed traction with support from entities like the Long-Term Stock Exchange. Proponents believe the shift would reduce regulatory burdens, while critics argue it would deprive investors of timely and crucial financial information, potentially leading to less-informed investment decisions.

          <p>This article details a borrower's experience of having their federal student loan servicer changed without clear, direct notification, leading to confusion and concern over their account status. The transfer resulted in the loan being placed in an administrative forbearance, a costly reprieve where interest continues to accrue, without the borrower's request. Experts advise that during such transfers, which are becoming more common, borrowers should save their payment amounts and wait until the new account is fully active to avoid processing errors. It also highlights the importance of checking all communication channels from servicers.</p>

          <p>A 62-year-old San Francisco chef, Valentino Luchin, has been arrested for allegedly robbing three banks in a single day. According to the San Francisco Police Department, Luchin passed a note demanding money to a bank employee on Grant Avenue and fled with cash. Investigators identified him as the suspect and linked him to two other similar robberies that occurred the same day in the Central District. Luchin, who previously worked at notable local restaurants, was booked into jail on two counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nomination of economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board is facing significant controversy ahead of a Senate vote. Critics and some lawmakers are alarmed by Miran's plan to take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role rather than resigning, raising concerns about the Fed's political independence. Miran's previous writings, which advocate for reducing the central bank's autonomy, have further fueled debate. If confirmed, he would join the board just before a key meeting on interest rates, amid the President's ongoing public pressure on the Fed.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the public response to Charlie Kirk's murder highlights a dangerous deterioration of American democracy and free speech principles. The author contrasts the current climate of immediate partisan blame with the shared national mourning that followed assassinations in the 1960s. It criticizes how the tragedy has been weaponized to undermine First Amendment protections and foster fear, rather than reinforce the idea that even polarizing figures deserve to speak without fear of violence. The piece expresses a fear that the nation is losing its commitment to democratic values.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has officially joined the exclusive $3 trillion market capitalization club, following in the footsteps of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged after a recent antitrust ruling delivered penalties that were less severe than investors had feared, boosting shareholder confidence. This milestone, achieved roughly 20 years after Google's IPO, comes as the company navigates increased competition from AI challengers and intense regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. Alphabet's shares are up over 30% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Outline Common Mistakes That Increase the Cost of Credit Card Debt</h2>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, this article outlines common mistakes that can make carrying a balance even more costly. Paying a bill late can trigger immediate fees and a high penalty APR, while allowing a balance to carry over month-to-month allows interest to compound daily, rapidly increasing the total amount owed. The article also highlights the mistake of not utilizing available strategies like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans, which can significantly reduce interest charges and simplify repayment.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy is Most Cost-Effective Power Source</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by CBS News, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, concludes that renewable energy sources are the most cost-effective to produce. According to a report from investment bank Lazard, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies like those in the Inflation Reduction Act. In contrast, fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, along with nuclear power, are more expensive to generate, partly due to ongoing fuel costs. The article also notes that factors like tariffs add complexity to the overall cost comparison. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since 2024, despite recent inflation data. This move would provide some relief for consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, although the impact of a small cut will be modest on already high rates. The article advises consumers to prioritize paying down high-interest debt, lock in high yields on savings accounts and CDs before rates fall, and improve their credit scores to qualify for the best loan terms in the future.

          <p>South Sudan's fragile 2018 peace agreement is on the verge of collapse after Vice President Riek Machar was charged with treason by President Salva Kiir's government. The deal was intended to end a brutal five-year civil war between forces loyal to Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, and Machar, from the rival Nuer group. Key provisions of the agreement, such as integrating armed forces and holding elections, were never fully implemented, and recent political maneuvers have escalated tensions, threatening to plunge the nation back into full-blown conflict amid a worsening economic crisis.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect. Robinson was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos and urged him to surrender. Investigators believe the suspect acted alone in what they describe as a "targeted attack," using a high-powered rifle from a campus building roof. While a motive remains under investigation, officials noted that Robinson had become more political in recent years and may have held views opposing Kirk's.</p>
