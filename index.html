          <p>A fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, resulted in injuries to 19 people, four of them seriously, after rockets reportedly exploded too close to the crowd. Eyewitnesses described some rockets flying sideways or detonating at low altitudes, with one believed to have misfired directly into spectators. The incident prompted an early end to the festivities to prevent panic. The article also touches on a separate warning from the German Red Cross about the public's lack of preparedness for major emergencies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has officially backed London's proposal to host the 2029 World Athletics Championships at London Stadium, the same venue used in 2017. This support follows a public campaign by over 100 British athletes and addresses previous concerns about the necessary government funding. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the event would be a moment of national pride and provide a significant economic boost. The government is also supporting a bid for the 2029 World Para Athletics Championships to be held in a UK city outside of London.</p>

          <p>Edwin J. Feulner, a co-founder and the longest-serving president of The Heritage Foundation, has passed away at the age of 83. He is credited with transforming the conservative think tank from a small organization into a major policy influencer in Washington, D.C., particularly during the Reagan era. Feulner remained an active figure, recently co-writing the afterword for the controversial Project 2025 initiative and serving on Donald Trump's transition team. His colleagues remembered him as a visionary who championed a "big-tent conservatism" and shaped the modern conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC aims to rebound from a poor showing at the Club World Cup by securing a victory against their crosstown rivals, the LA Galaxy, in an upcoming MLS match. After being eliminated from the international tournament, LAFC has won three consecutive league games, but a win in the derby is seen as crucial for morale. Coach Steve Cherundolo emphasized that in a rivalry game, current standings are irrelevant, despite LAFC being fourth in the conference while the Galaxy is last. The match carries extra weight as it may be the last regular-season derby under Cherundolo's direction.</p>

Police monitored the operation for seven months, observing numerous drug handovers at ports and drop-offs in various cities.

Dubois is seeking to avenge his 2023 loss and become the undisputed heavyweight champion, a feat not achieved by a British fighter since 1999. While many experts, including Eddie Hearn and Tony Bellew, favor the undefeated Usyk due to his proven skill and track record, others believe the re-energized Dubois has a strong chance. The key questions revolve around whether Usyk's age is a factor and if Dubois's recent form and power can overcome the champion's technical prowess.</p>

Instead of engineering the cells in a lab, this new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce the anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body. The approach is reported to be easier to program and significantly cheaper than conventional CAR-T treatments, which can cost over $139,000. Researchers successfully used the in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, marking a potentially significant advance in making immunotherapy more accessible.</p>

The severe weather follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and hard, increasing the likelihood of rapid surface water runoff.

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose a More Powerful X-Shaped Electromagnetic Railgun</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new design for an electromagnetic railgun that could be significantly more powerful than the current naval version. The proposed "X-rail gun" involves cross-stacking two railguns, a configuration intended to nearly double the force and overcome the power limitations of the existing technology. This would allow it to fire heavier projectiles, up to 30kg, at speeds of Mach 7, making it more effective for military applications. The research aims to address the shortcomings of the navy's pioneering railgun.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported that the number of serious water pollution incidents caused by water companies in England rose by 60% in 2024, with a total of 75 such events. Overall pollution incidents reached a record high of 2,801, more than double the industry's reduction target. A parliamentary committee described the situation as "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The data highlights systemic failures in the sector, attributed to underinvestment in infrastructure, with companies like Thames Water being the primary offenders for the most severe incidents.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the U.S. space program returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority still believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile achievement that contributed to national pride. Furthermore, the public generally views the space program as a source of beneficial technological advancements, reflecting broad positive sentiment.</p>

          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing, hindering its ability to protect workers. The audit found the agency had a 32% vacancy rate, leading to it closing complaint and accident cases without proper on-site inspections or sufficient documentation. When inspections did occur, they often lacked thoroughness, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced. Labor advocates argue this chronic understaffing has crippled the agency's enforcement capabilities, leaving millions of workers vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, his companies News Corp and Dow Jones, and two reporters from The Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from an article that reported Trump had sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which allegedly included a hand-drawn sketch of a naked woman. Trump vehemently denies writing the letter, calling the report "false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS." The suit accuses the defendants of knowingly publishing false statements to link him to the disgraced financier, while the newspaper has stated it has full confidence in its reporting.</p>
