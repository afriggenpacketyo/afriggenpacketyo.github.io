          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has confirmed that a recent cyberattack resulted in the theft of personal customer data, including contact details, dates of birth, and online order histories, but assured that payment details and passwords remain secure. The retailer is working to restore services after the attack, which initially caused issues with Click & Collect and contactless payments, and prompted the suspension of online orders since late April. M&S is advising customers to be cautious of potential phishing attempts and will prompt password resets as a precautionary measure. The DragonForce cybercrime service is believed to be behind the attack, using a double extortion method to steal and scramble data.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire nearby. The first incident occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, while the second targeted Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, where a small fire damaged the entrance. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the properties' connection to a high-profile public figure, treating the fires as suspicious. Starmer, who owns the Kentish Town home but resides at Downing Street, is cooperating with authorities as the investigation unfolds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite government initiatives aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing, companies are struggling to fill nearly half a million open positions due to a skills gap and an aging workforce. The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte project a need for 3.8 million additional workers by 2033, with a potential shortfall of 1.9 million if workforce challenges are not addressed. While some positions require college degrees, many in-demand roles, such as maintenance technicians and machine operators, do not. Some experts suggest higher pay and improved perceptions of manufacturing jobs are needed to attract more workers, while others advocate for increased investment in apprenticeship programs to develop necessary skills.</p>

          <p>Luce Allen, a senior transgender girl, won a 200-meter race at a Pennsylvania high school track meet, defeating a biological female freshman by a narrow margin. Allen's victory has reignited the debate over transgender athletes' participation in sports, with supporters emphasizing inclusivity and opponents raising concerns about fairness. Allen's lawyer previously stated that preventing transgender individuals from competing with their gender identity would hinder their development, while Allen's mother affirmed her child's female identity. The state of Pennsylvania has been at the forefront of this issue, particularly since Lia Thomas's success in collegiate swimming.</p>

          <p>A French court has found GÃ©rard Depardieu guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set, sentencing the actor to an 18-month suspended prison term. The judges found the women's accounts credible and consistent, supported by witness testimony, while Depardieu denied all wrongdoing and plans to appeal. The verdict marks a significant moment in France's reckoning with the #MeToo movement and the broader discussion on defining sexual assault, especially within the film industry. Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, a lawyer for one of the victims, stated that this decision confirms Depardieu is a sexual abuser.</p>

The company reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, exacerbated by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, putting further pressure on the struggling firm. A proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February, leading to the replacement of the chief executive. The car giant did not give a forecast for income in the coming year due to the "uncertain nature of US tariff measures".</p>

The board argues that Trump's tariff policies have been repudiated and have hurt America's ability to rally a united front against China's mercantilism. The newspaper suggests that markets have forced Trump to retreat from his vision of high tariff walls ushering in a new "golden age," which it describes as short-lived and "more leaden than golden."</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the confusing and often contradictory nature of President Trump's tariff policy, including the recent trade agreements with Britain and China. Economists and trade experts express bewilderment over Trump's rationale and the actual impact of the tariffs on the U.S. economy. The author questions Trump's belief that trade deficits are inherently harmful and highlights the potential for these policies to disrupt long-standing international trade relationships. The article notes that the question of whether the imposition of these tariffs is even constitutional will be heard by the federal Court of International Trade.</p>

          <p>Insurers are seeking to surcharge California homeowners to recoup costs from the Los Angeles County fires, with the state's insurer of last resort, the California FAIR Plan, needing a bailout. The FAIR Plan assessed its member carriers $1 billion, and now insurers are filing applications to surcharge their policyholders statewide for half the costs. Consumer Watchdog has sued to stop the surcharges, arguing they violate state law. The policy is part of an effort to stabilize California's troubled homeowners insurance market, but it raises concerns about fairness and affordability for homeowners already facing rising premiums.</p>
