          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's ongoing refusal to accept a ceasefire is complicating efforts to achieve a peace agreement. His comments came after a summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, where Russia reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region. Zelenskyy has consistently maintained that no substantive negotiations can occur until the fighting stops, a position he will reiterate during his upcoming White House meeting with President Trump and European leaders. The situation remains tense as Ukraine continues to face nightly drone and missile attacks from Russia.</p>

Speaking on Sunday, Rubio emphasized that a peace deal requires compromise from both sides, as neither is on the verge of surrender. He indicated that upcoming talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders will focus on narrowing the gap between the two sides on key issues like security guarantees and territorial boundaries. This signals the U.S. administration's diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil liberty and anti-racism organizations has formally requested that London's Metropolitan Police abandon plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the upcoming Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the groups described LFR as a mass surveillance tool that treats attendees as suspects and has a documented history of being less accurate for women and people of color. The Met Police defended its use, stating the technology is accurate and essential for keeping the large-scale cultural event safe.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel participated in a "day of stoppage," blocking major highways and closing businesses to pressure the government into securing a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, which led to dozens of arrests as police used water cannons, mark an escalation in public frustration with the handling of the 22-month-long war. Organizers and families of hostages fear that further military action will endanger the captives still believed to be alive in the territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal scored by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed following a VAR review due to a specific rule infringement. The law, introduced in the 2019-20 season, states that when a defensive wall consists of three or more players, any attacking player must remain at least one meter away from it. A Palace player was found to be inside this one-meter zone, leading the referee to overturn the goal and award an indirect free-kick to Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Award-winning Irish author Sally Rooney has publicly stated she will continue to support the pro-Palestinian direct-action group Palestine Action, despite its recent proscription as a terrorist organization by the UK government. Rooney wrote that she intends to use her earnings and public platform to support the group's campaigns, which have targeted arms companies. The UK Home Secretary defended the ban, citing the group's tactics and an alleged manual providing guidance for attacks, stating they are not a legitimate protest group.</p>

          <p>The recent investigation and expulsion of several senior officials from ethnic minority communities is being interpreted by observers as a significant shift in Chinese elite politics. Traditionally, high-ranking posts in autonomous regions were reserved for non-Han officials to promote ethnic inclusion, and these figures were rarely targeted in anti-graft probes. The downfalls suggest this ethnicity-based leniency is ending as the government's push for strict political discipline and anti-corruption measures is applied more uniformly across the country.</p>

          <p>While financial markets remained largely unfazed by recent inflation data, some economists are warning of more concerning underlying trends. A hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index, driven by persistent services inflation, suggests broad-based price pressures that are not solely related to tariffs. This places the Federal Reserve in a difficult position, as a softening labor market may call for interest rate cuts, while this stubborn inflation could require continued restraint or even future rate hikes.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russian President Vladimir Putin achieved his primary objectives at the Alaska summit with President Trump, returning home without making any meaningful concessions on the war in Ukraine. The piece contends that Trump, by accepting Putin's framework that a comprehensive peace agreement must precede a ceasefire, has weakened the negotiating position of Ukraine and its European allies. The author suggests Putin successfully avoided the threat of new sanctions while sowing further distrust between the U.S. and Europe.</p>

They argue Trump's actions are a political distraction designed to create chaos and could dangerously escalate tensions rather than solve underlying issues.</p>

          <p>A transgender long-distance runner, Evie Parts, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA and Swarthmore College, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team due to her gender identity. The suit argues the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX with its policy banning transgender athletes from women's sports. Parts claims the removal caused her significant emotional distress before she was eventually reinstated for the remainder of her final season.</p>
