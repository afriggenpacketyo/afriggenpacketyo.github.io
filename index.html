        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Heathrow Airport is contemplating a lawsuit against National Grid after an investigation revealed that a major fire causing the airport's closure stemmed from a known fault at an electrical substation. The report found that National Grid was aware of a moisture issue affecting electrical components since 2018 but repeatedly deferred maintenance. The shutdown resulted in significant financial losses, estimated between Â£80-Â£100 million for airlines, and has prompted a separate investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem into National Grid's failure to prevent the incident.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow 51-50 victory in the Senate secured by a tie-breaking vote, President Trump's major tax and immigration bill is now before the House for a final vote. The legislation includes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts, new border security funding, and cuts to health programs like Medicaid. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects it will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade and could result in 11.8 million people losing their health insurance, creating a contentious debate in the closely divided House.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has put forward an ambitious new climate goal, proposing a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 compared to 1990 levels. This plan builds upon the existing 2030 target and introduces more flexibility, allowing member states to use some carbon credits from non-EU countries.

Today, however, Canada faces an illiberal American administration threatening annexation, leading to a defense of Canadian sovereignty led by the Liberal Party, which champions a modern, multicultural identity that now stands in contrast to the current U.S. political climate.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama has officially confirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue after his death, ending speculation about his succession. In a video message, he stated that only the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he founded, has the authority to identify his successor, a clear rejection of any potential interference from Beijing. China's government immediately dismissed the announcement, insisting that any reincarnation must comply with Chinese laws and receive government approval, highlighting the deep political tensions surrounding the future of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the 'necessary conditions' for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a deal to release hostages. A Hamas official stated the group is ready to agree if the deal leads to a complete end to the war, a long-standing demand that may clash with Israel's goal of 'complete victory' over Hamas.</p>

          <p>A federal lawsuit has been filed against the Trump administration, alleging that immigration raids in Southern California are unconstitutional and have placed the region 'under siege.' The suit, brought by civil rights groups and affected individuals, claims that masked, unidentified agents are systematically targeting brown-skinned people, making arrests without probable cause, and holding them in 'dungeon-like' conditions. The legal action seeks to block these practices, arguing they are the result of directives from top officials to increase arrest numbers by flouting legal and constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>While some conservative pockets of Orange County have celebrated President Trump's immigration sweeps, the raids are causing unease elsewhere in the traditionally Republican area. A group of Republican state legislators, including two from the county, wrote to Trump urging him to focus on criminals and avoid disrupting workplaces, warning of economic harm. The article highlights a nuanced local response, where even some Trump supporters express hesitation about broad enforcement actions that target longtime residents and essential workers.</p>
