          <p>Everton's women's team will be moving to Goodison Park after the club decided against demolishing the 132-year-old stadium. The club's original plans included an £82m post-demolition renovation project for housing, a care home, retail units, and a park. After being taken over by The Friedkin Group, a feasibility study led to the decision to maintain the stadium for the women's team, with Goodison Park becoming the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country with a capacity of 39,572. This move aims to boost the team's performance and provide economic opportunities for local businesses.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced Saudi Arabia's commitment to invest $600 billion in a series of deals with the United States, following a visit with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A key agreement is a nearly $142 billion defense sales deal, providing the kingdom with state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms, nearly double Saudi Arabia's 2025 defense budget. The White House's announcement did not specify when the defense deal is expected to conclude. Trump participated at a U.S.-Saudi investment forum in Riyadh.</p>

The union is seeking equal pay for equal work, while NJ Transit argues that the proposed terms would cost taxpayers billions. If the strike commences, NJ Transit strongly encourages commuters to work from home and limit travel, as contingency plans can only accommodate a fraction of the usual rail customers. The strike would also significantly increase traffic in Manhattan and commuters will have to pay recently enacted congestion pricing.</p>

          <p>A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of International Trade is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power in enacting steep tariffs on over 180 countries. The lawsuit was filed by five domestic businesses that rely on imported goods not readily available in the U.S., arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the sweeping duties. The Department of Justice contends that the law clearly allows the president to impose tariffs. This case marks the first time a panel of judges has heard a challenge to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following the first set of talks since President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, both Beijing and Washington claimed victory after the removal of most of the steep import duties. However, analysts suggest that Beijing emerged with the upper hand, consolidating its status as a credible global counterweight to Washington. China entered the negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from dealing with Trump during his first term. The real significance lies in the performative dimension of power projection, which could prove more valuable over the long term than immediate economic gains.</p>

He contends that Trump's open self-enrichment and flouting of norms are seen by his base as signs of strength and defiance against a rigged system. Edsall cites various scholars who suggest that Trump's supporters have been instructed to think about corruption more broadly, viewing Democratic policies as inherently corrupt and untrustworthy.

However, Trump's 2024 restoration has sparked a debate over whether Biden's policies failed. Critics argue that Bidenomics caused inflation and failed to help the working class, while defenders point to investment successes and political resilience. The debate centers on whether Democrats lost in 2024 despite or because of Biden's post-neoliberal approach.

          <p>The Trump administration announced additional cuts of $450 million in grants to Harvard University through eight federal agencies, supplementing the $2.2 billion already frozen. The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism cited Harvard's failure to address race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus as the reason. This is the latest in a series of funding hits for Harvard, which has been engaged in a legal battle with the administration over these funding cuts. Harvard President Alan Garber previously defended the university's constitutional rights after filing a lawsuit against the administration.</p>

President Trump eliminated the exemption because he believed China wasn't sufficiently addressing fentanyl flow into the U.S. Companies selling goods made in the U.S. could benefit from reduced competition.</p>

While a temporary trade truce with China has been reached, economists warn that the scope of the tariffs will eventually stoke inflation while simultaneously denting growth.
