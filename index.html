          <h2>Inside Story Reveals GOP's Internal Strife and White House Deals to Pass Trump's Major Bill</h2>

          <p>An in-depth report reveals the intense internal negotiations and dramatic, sleepless nights House Republicans endured to pass President Trump's signature megabill. The process exposed deep divisions within the party, with leaders like Whip Tom Emmer struggling to manage holdouts from the hard-line conservative faction. Ultimately, passage was secured not by party leadership alone, but through a series of backroom deals and a charm offensive from President Trump himself, who negotiated directly with holdouts. This legislative saga highlights a dynamic where some conservative members now prefer to bypass House leadership and deal directly with the White House, potentially complicating future legislative efforts.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reassigned field office employees to handle its national 800 number, successfully reducing phone wait times but creating significant new backlogs and stress elsewhere. Frontline workers and union representatives report that this staff shuffle has increased their workloads and delayed the processing of vital claims, such as disability benefits. Experts argue this is a "rearranging the deck chairs" scenario, caused by chronic understaffing that has worsened under the Trump administration. Despite the agency's claims of improved service, the move highlights a deep systemic crisis where there are simply not enough employees to serve the public effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As communities celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the article highlights both the progress made and current anxieties within the disability community. Events like an inclusive rollerskating party in Cincinnati showcase the liberation and integration the ADA has fostered, allowing people with disabilities to participate more fully in public life. However, this celebration is tempered by significant concern over pending Medicaid cuts and stricter work requirements, which threaten the support systems many rely on. Activists are mobilizing to educate policymakers on the potential harm of these changes, emphasizing the ongoing fight for rights and resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article profiles a man in Montana who intentionally underreports his income to remain eligible for Medicaid, highlighting a systemic issue known as the "benefit cliff." Despite working and receiving a raise, he cannot afford private insurance or necessary medications, forcing him to break the rules to access care that enables him to work. This personal story provides a counter-narrative to claims of widespread fraud, illustrating how hardworking individuals can be trapped by a system where a small pay increase leads to a total loss of essential health benefits. The situation is exacerbated by new federal rules that increase eligibility hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

To fund the project, the government has confirmed its 44.9% stake and announced investments from private partners, including Centrica. Officials state the new plant will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during its construction but is projected to lower them by £2 billion annually once operational in the mid-to-late 2030s. Critics express alarm over the escalating costs and guarantees that place financial risk on the public, while supporters emphasize the long-term energy security and job creation benefits.

His success is tied to Nvidia's critical role in the AI revolution, giving him significant leverage in shaping US-China tech policy. A key victory for Huang was the recent reversal of restrictions on exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China, a move he actively lobbied for by arguing it was necessary to maintain US tech leadership. This demonstrates a shift in the tech-politics landscape, where the strategic importance of AI hardware has made Huang a central figure in global trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's recent threat to veto the EU's 18th sanctions package against Russia is being analyzed as a political maneuver primarily for his domestic audience. Following the playbook of Hungary's Viktor Orban, Fico created a standoff with the EU before ultimately backing down, claiming concessions that were largely already assured. Commentators in Slovakia suggest this performance was designed to distract from pressing domestic issues, such as a large budget deficit, a structural economic crisis, and ongoing corruption scandals. The article argues that Fico's anti-EU rhetoric serves to construct a narrative of fighting for national sovereignty while he consolidates power and pushes a conservative agenda at home.</p>

The administration counters that it has the discretion to cancel grants with institutions that are non-compliant with presidential directives. This case is a major test of the administration's strategy to influence higher education institutions by threatening their funding, with a ruling potentially impacting numerous other universities facing similar pressures.

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK rose to £20.7 billion in June, exceeding expectations and placing additional pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The increase was driven by higher spending on public services and soaring debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation.

Analysts suggest that recent policy reversals on welfare and persistent economic headwinds make future tax rises or spending cuts in the autumn Budget increasingly likely.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced a plan to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research and development capabilities by 2030. This major commitment comes as the pharmaceutical industry faces the prospect of significant trade tariffs from the Trump administration. A cornerstone of the investment will be a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia to produce its portfolio of weight management drugs, including its oral GLP-1 pill. The move follows similar announcements from other global pharma firms and is seen as an effort to bolster domestic production and align with the administration's goal of reshoring manufacturing, supporting AstraZeneca's ambition to generate half of its future revenue from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil its first-ever sanctions regime specifically targeting people-smuggling networks, a key part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to curb small boat crossings. The measures will publicly name and impose asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of individuals and entities, including gang leaders, boat suppliers, and financial middlemen. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the plan as a world-first initiative against irregular migration. This move comes amid increasing pressure on the government to address the rising number of Channel crossings, though critics question whether targeting individuals can disrupt the vast and adaptable smuggling industry as a whole.</p>

The statement argued that an "extreme online environment" amplifies these tensions, causing jokes about gender to be misinterpreted as broad attacks. This official criticism highlights the government's sensitivity to online discourse and the fine line comedians must walk when addressing social topics like gender dynamics in China's controlled media landscape.</p>

Their strength in wide areas, with skilled dribblers as wing-backs, could pose a significant threat to England's defense, particularly the left-back position. While England are considered favorites, Italy's confidence, cohesive play rooted in club partnerships, and ability to capitalize on mistakes make them a dangerous opponent capable of causing an upset.</p>
