          <p>Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, delivered a defiant speech following her husband's assassination, vowing that his movement will grow stronger and that her cries will serve as a "battle cry." She framed his killing as a result of his message of patriotism and faith, urging his young followers to remain engaged with his Turning Point USA organization. The article provides context on Kirk's influential but often divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, which played a significant role in mobilizing young people for the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>As part of a US-brokered deal, Belarus released 52 political prisoners, but opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya reports they were not truly freed but rather forcibly deported. The prisoners were sent to Lithuania in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions on Belarus's national airline. While some former prisoners expressed gratitude for their release, others stated they would have preferred to remain in Belarus, especially as many were already nearing the end of their sentences.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican-led legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan, a mid-decade move backed by former President Trump that could secure an additional U.S. House seat for the party. The new map strategically divides the Kansas City area, making the district of a long-time Democratic representative more conservative. Opponents immediately filed a lawsuit, arguing the redrawing is an unconstitutional gerrymander designed to rig elections.</p>

          <p>A new study from Harvard researchers has found a significant link between experiencing violence and cardiovascular health in women. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses, revealed that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk of heart disease, while those who had obtained a restraining order faced a 70% higher risk. These findings suggest that such traumatic experiences should be considered alongside traditional risk factors when assessing women's heart health.</p>

          <p>A report released by House Republicans has identified nearly 50 academic partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities as "high-risk" and called for them to be terminated. The committees expressed concern that these joint institutes and degree programs could be exploited by Beijing to advance its military and technological capabilities. This move represents an escalation in the effort to curb academic collaboration between the two countries amid growing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The sequel to the 1984 rock mockumentary classic, "This Is Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast but fails to recapture the magic of the first film, according to this review. While offering some nostalgic enjoyment, the movie is criticized for leaning heavily on celebrity cameos from figures like Paul McCartney and Elton John. This approach ultimately saps the satire of its outsider tension, making it feel more like a tribute than a fresh comedic take.</p>
