          <p>A second unvaccinated child in Texas has died from complications related to measles, as a significant outbreak continues to spread across multiple states. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the affected area, acknowledging the importance of the MMR vaccine while also expressing some reservations about its safety. The CDC has deployed teams to assist with the outbreak response, which has seen measles cases more than double compared to last year. Experts anticipate the outbreak could persist for months, raising concerns about the U.S.'s measles elimination status.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $78,000, as cryptocurrency markets mirrored a broader sell-off in global equities.

Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether and Solana, also suffered substantial losses, triggering liquidations for traders betting on price increases. Bitcoin's price movement is often seen as an indicator of overall market sentiment, and this drop reflects increasing investor anxiety about the economic impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Corporate executives surveyed at the Yale CEO Caucus indicated that a 20% drop in the stock market would prompt them to collectively voice concerns about President Trump's tariffs. While the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 have already entered bear market territory, CEOs have largely avoided public criticism of the tariffs. However, the recent market volatility may lead to a shift in their approach, with some suggesting trade groups should take a more forceful stance.</p>

          <p>A US judge has issued a scathing opinion against the Trump administration after immigration officials admitted to having mistakenly deported a man living in the US to a prison in El Salvador. The opinion issued by US District Judge Paula Xinis on Sunday reaffirms her earlier ruling that demands Kilmar Abrego Garcia be returned to the US by Monday night. The judge says Mr Garcia was seized "without any lawful authority" and held "without legal basis", in "direct contravention" of US law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market's sharp decline due to President Trump's tariffs presents challenges, but outright selling may be ill-advised for long-term investors. Instead, focus on buying non-tariffed winners as the overall market drops. A potential recession and inflation are cons to consider, along with retaliatory tariffs from other countries. While a 25% chance of a market bottom exists, a more nuanced approach with commonsense negotiations is needed.&#x20;
