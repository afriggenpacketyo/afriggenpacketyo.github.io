            <h2>Trump's Tariffs on China Expected to Severely Impact American Businesses</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's imposition of 145% tariffs on Chinese imports is predicted to cause substantial and potentially irreversible harm to numerous American businesses, particularly small businesses that cannot sustain such high costs. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments from China as businesses halt container exports. While technology hardware received a temporary reprieve, industries like furniture, toys, apparel, and footwear are experiencing a complete cessation of orders from U.S. importers, leading to potential product shortages and lost sales. Experts warn that these tariffs could effectively halt trade between the U.S. and China, necessitating a pause to prevent irreversible damage. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom experienced its warmest day of the year, reaching 24C (75.2F) in Northolt, London, following a dry, sunny start to April, although a change in weather is anticipated soon. Temperatures have been significantly above the average for April, with Scotland and Northern Ireland also recording their warmest days earlier in the week. Simultaneously, large parts of England and Wales are experiencing "very high" pollen levels, primarily from Birch and Ash trees, which are expected to decrease by Wednesday as the weather becomes more unsettled. The recent sunny weather has resulted in some areas seeing almost their entire monthly average of sunshine within the first third of the month.</p>

Langer shared how an offhand comment during a post-victory interview led him to explore his faith more deeply, ultimately leading to a spiritual rebirth. Despite missing the cut by a single stroke, Langer expressed contentment with his performance and legacy, hoping to be remembered as a good golfer, a man of faith, and a family man who treated others well. He cited the increasing length of the course as a reason for stepping away from the tournament.</p>

            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for his response to an anti-Israel protester who claimed a "genocide" was occurring in Gaza. Carney had acknowledged awareness of the situation in Gaza, referencing Canada's arms embargo, which drew condemnation from Jewish organizations who asserted that there is no genocide in Gaza. Carney later clarified that he did not hear the protester use the word "genocide" due to the noise. Canada had previously halted arms sales to Israel earlier in the year, further escalating tensions.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff strategy is under scrutiny, with critics questioning its effectiveness in revitalizing American manufacturing. Despite the administration's claims that tariffs will bring jobs and factories back to the U.S., experts argue that the skills needed for complex manufacturing processes, such as assembling iPhones, are not readily available in the country. Case studies, like TSMC's experience setting up a plant in Arizona, highlight the challenges and costs associated with reshoring manufacturing. The complexity of global supply chains and the need for specialized skills make it difficult to achieve significant manufacturing gains within a single electoral cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A U.S. missionary pastor, Josh Sullivan, was abducted at gunpoint from his church in South Africa while delivering a sermon. Four armed and masked men entered the Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell, robbing cell phones and taking Sullivan, in what appears to be a kidnapping for ransom. Police are investigating, and a colleague suggests the abduction is financially motivated. The U.S. State Department is aware of the kidnapping, and supporters are offering prayers for Sullivan's safe return.</p>

            <p>Human remains and bone fragments were discovered at a construction site on Temple University's campus during routine site preparation. The university says the discovery was not unexpected, as the site occupies a portion of the former Monument Cemetery, which was acquired in the 1950s and its remains relocated. Crews immediately stopped work and followed established protocols, notifying the Philadelphia Coroner's office, the Medical Examiner's Office, archeologists, and law enforcement. Students expressed shock and interest in the discoveries.</p>

            <p>Amid uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies, Americans are adjusting their spending habits, with some stocking up on goods, delaying major purchases, or shifting to local and independent shops. Concerns about rising prices and economic instability are driving these changes. Some consumers are reducing subscriptions and travel plans, while others are converting investments to cash. Small business owners are also feeling the impact, with some reporting reduced demand. The tariff uncertainty is prompting a reevaluation of consumer habits and a focus on sustainability.</p>

            <p>A report indicates that US support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of American weapons to Taiwan or Israel, but weak supply chains pose a risk. The report tracked the production capacity and delivery timelines of 25 items, finding that only seven had a strong defense industrial base in the United States. The authors warned that insufficient spending has damaged US defense industrial bases, potentially hindering the country's ability to sustain weapons supplies to its partners. The Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defense spending for next year. (not investment advice)</p>

The ranking is based on year-over-year growth in listing views and a Redfin Compete Score. People are seeking neighborhoods with access to city amenities but also with suburban charm. The Midwest is attractive due to stable insurance costs, property taxes, and a stable housing market. Homes in these neighborhoods are selling quicker than a year ago, with many experiencing a lack of available homes for sale.</p>

            <p>Alex Garland's film *Warfare*, co-directed with Ray Mendoza, offers a starkly realistic portrayal of a military operation during the Iraq War, differing from the more fantastical *Civil War*. The film focuses on a specific skirmish from the 2006 Battle of Ramadi, emphasizing the tension and waiting that characterize much of wartime conflict. Unlike typical war movies, *Warfare* avoids a traditional three-act structure, instead presenting a continuous cycle of anticipation, chaos, and relief. The movie commits to showing the often tedious and frustrating aspects of war, challenging viewers to embrace the ambiguity and confusion experienced by soldiers.</p>

            <p>The number of UK residents visiting the US has declined, with analysts attributing the drop to Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric, which may be making tourists feel less welcome. Claims that other countries were "cheating" Americans and reports of deportations are believed to have had a chilling effect. The decline may worsen in the summer, as tourists typically book holidays months in advance. The US travel industry had previously benefited from a strong dollar attracting European tourists.</p>

Wind gusts of up to 93mph (150kph) have forced the closure of attractions and historic sites. Millions were urged to stay indoors, and some state media outlets warned that people weighing less than 50kg may be "easily blown away". The strong winds are from a cold vortex system over Mongolia and are expected to last through the weekend.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has excluded smartphones, laptop computers, and machines used to make semiconductors from its so-called “reciprocal tariffs”, a significant carve-out for items heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, and the latest twist in a trade war that has roiled global markets for more than a week. The exemptions, announced late Friday by the US Customs and Border Protections, narrowed the impact of the 125 per cent tariffs on China – which step up to 145 per cent when earlier levies related to fentanyl trafficking are factored in – and a 10 per cent global baseline tariff, providing a reprieve for global technology giants like Apple Inc.
