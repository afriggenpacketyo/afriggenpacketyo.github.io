          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine pilot, is appealing his extradition from Australia to the United States where he is accused of illegally training Chinese military pilots over a decade ago. The indictment alleges he instructed Chinese aviators on aircraft carrier takeoff and landing procedures in exchange for substantial payments. Duggan, who became an Australian citizen and renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2012, denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated. His legal team argues there are flaws in the extradition process, questioning the validity of extraditing an Australian citizen for actions in South Africa that allegedly broke U.S. law.</p>

          <p>Armenia's government has arrested two high-ranking Apostolic archbishops, escalating a conflict with the influential church ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections. Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan was jailed for making public calls to seize power, while Bishop Mkrtich Proshyan faces charges of coercing participation in rallies. The church, which has taken on an opposition role, claims the arrests are part of a systematic anti-church campaign by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's government. The rift began after the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, with analysts suggesting the government is trying to neutralize the church as a political force.</p>

The new tasks will include small online jobs such as uploading photos or recording voice prompts to help train artificial intelligence models. This initiative, announced at the company's annual conference, is similar to platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk and aims to provide more income streams for its gig workers. Uber also announced the official rollout of its women rider preference feature and a delayed ride guarantee for drivers.</p>

          <p>An Alaska Airlines flight from Portland to Dallas was forced to make an emergency landing in Boise, Idaho, after a passenger allegedly assaulted two flight attendants. The passenger, identified as 61-year-old Tracy Barkhimer, reportedly began behaving erratically before striking the crew members who were attempting to de-escalate the situation. She was restrained by others on the flight until landing, where she was arrested by Boise police and charged with misdemeanor battery. Alaska Airlines has since banned the passenger from future flights and emphasized its zero-tolerance policy for violence against its employees.</p>

          <p>The city of Cardiff has approved a new 10-year parking plan that includes charging higher fees for residential parking permits for heavier and more polluting vehicles, such as SUVs. The measure is intended to reduce congestion, cut air pollution, and encourage the use of public transport, walking, or cycling. The plan also involves restructuring the city into three parking zones, scrapping new resident permits in the city center, and creating new permits for carers and NHS workers. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions from residents, with some supporting the environmental goals while others express concern about the financial impact on tradespeople.</p>

          <p>MI5 Director Sir Ken McCallum has stated that Chinese state operatives pose a daily national security threat to the UK, revealing his frustration over the recent collapse of a high-profile spy case. The prosecution against two men accused of spying for China was dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service determined the evidence did not sufficiently prove China was a threat. This decision has sparked political controversy, with Conservatives accusing the government of appeasing China for economic reasons. Witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser, however, described China's "large scale espionage" against the country, raising questions about why the case did not proceed.</p>

Trump stated that Modi gave him an assurance during a phone call, but an Indian government spokesperson said they were "not aware of any conversation" taking place. Since the war in Ukraine began, India has become a major buyer of discounted Russian crude oil, a practice the U.S. has been pressuring Delhi to end.

This technological development could significantly alter the strategic balance of military power, challenging the effectiveness of stealth technology, a cornerstone of U.S. air dominance.

Experts warn that if the shutdown is prolonged, unpaid federal employees may begin calling in sick, leading to staffing shortages at airports across the country. This could result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations, as seen during the 2018-2019 shutdown when about 10% of TSA workers were absent. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to halt the mortgage market, but it could cause delays for some homebuyers. While conventional loans from private lenders should be processed normally, applicants for government-backed loans from the FHA and VA may face slower processing times due to staff furloughs. Furthermore, the USDA will stop issuing new home loans entirely during the shutdown. A significant potential issue is the disruption to the National Flood Insurance Program, which could prevent closings for homes in high-risk flood zones that require this federally-administered insurance.</p>

          <p>While hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed paychecks due to the government shutdown, members of Congress and the President will continue to be paid. Lawmakers' salaries are funded by a permanent appropriation under the Constitution and are not subject to the annual funding lapse that causes shutdowns. This legal distinction means that while essential federal workers must report to their jobs without immediate pay, the officials responsible for passing a budget are financially unaffected. Congressional staffers, however, are treated like other federal employees and will see their paychecks delayed until the shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1. This legal requirement, rooted in the Antideficiency Act, forces all non-essential government functions to cease operations. During a shutdown, essential employees like military personnel, air traffic controllers, and some law enforcement must continue to work without pay, while non-essential workers are furloughed. While entitlement programs like Social Security continue, many public services, from national parks to customer service at federal agencies, can be disrupted or closed entirely.</p>

The current ceasefire plan calls for an interim committee of Palestinian technocrats to govern, but security remains volatile as Hamas police clash with armed factions on the streets. The massive rebuilding effort is hampered by a lack of equipment and Israeli restrictions on materials like concrete, which it fears could be used for military purposes. With over 90% of buildings damaged or destroyed, the path to recovery requires stability, international aid, and a resolution to complex political and security issues.</p>

The four-hour journey down the steep and avalanche-prone face required him to navigate extremely difficult terrain, including a 200-meter rappel down bare rock.
