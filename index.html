The Israeli military targeted the port and a cement factory, claiming the port was a key income source for the Houthis. The Houthi militia, which controls much of northwestern Yemen, has been launching missiles and drones at Israel for over a year, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Despite ongoing retaliatory airstrikes, neither side has achieved its goals, with the Houthis vowing to continue attacks until the end of the Israeli campaign against Hamas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a plan to pay unauthorized immigrants $1,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, coupled with travel assistance. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem framed the plan as a cost-effective and safe alternative to forced deportation. Immigration experts, however, caution that self-deportation may lead immigrants with potential legal pathways to residency to leave without exploring their options. The administration promotes the offer as a 'dignified way to leave' that could improve future legal re-entry prospects, a claim some experts dispute, citing potential re-entry bars of up to 10 years.</p>

          <p>The Army has temporarily suspended helicopter training flights around the Pentagon after two commercial flights were disrupted last week. The decision was prompted by an incident where an Army helicopter on a training mission was instructed to circle the Pentagon again before landing, leading to 'go-arounds' for two commercial flights at Reagan National Airport. The FAA stated the Black Hawk was a priority air transport helicopter, while Army officials disputed claims the helicopter took a 'scenic route.' This pause comes shortly after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for the DCA air traffic control team and restricted nonessential helicopter operations around the airport.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant travel disruptions due to a communication breakdown at an air traffic control center, coupled with existing staffing shortages and runway construction. Air traffic controllers briefly lost communication with planes, leading to hundreds of delays, cancellations, and flight diversions. The FAA acknowledged that its antiquated air traffic control system is affecting its workforce, while Senator Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into the issues. United Airlines has cut flights from its Newark schedule due to the ongoing problems.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S., citing a 'dying' American movie industry and claiming foreign incentives for filmmakers pose a national security threat. The announcement follows increased criticism of the administration's aggressive trade policies and China's reduction of U.S. film imports. The practical application of these tariffs remains unclear, particularly regarding television series and the specific aspects of production that would be affected.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate to 50% from 100%, following concerns that the higher rate could cause financial hardship for beneficiaries. The change comes after SSA began recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments are due to SSA's calculation errors, not the fault of the beneficiary. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, some experts argue that taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden for many.</p>
