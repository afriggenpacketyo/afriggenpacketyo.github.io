          <p>A year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate is raging over the age of the South Pole-Aitken basin. Chinese scientists have proposed a new age of 4.25 billion years based on direct analysis of these samples, challenging existing models that rely on crater counting. This new finding, described as the most credible evidence to date, has faced resistance and was reportedly rejected twice for peer review by a panel of Western scientists. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions and differing methodologies within the international planetary science community.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy, Micah, was diagnosed with the extremely rare Danon disease after experiencing chest pains, a condition his mother also unknowingly had. This genetic disorder led to severe heart failure, necessitating a heart transplant for Micah, just as his mother had years earlier. The shared, harrowing experience inspired Micah and his mother to create "Transplant Teenz," a non-profit virtual support group for teenagers awaiting organ transplants. This initiative aims to provide a community and resources that Micah found lacking during his own journey.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has announced the upcoming closure of its joint venture car plant in Nanjing, China, which it operates with local partner SAIC. The factory, which produced models like the Passat and Skoda Superb, is being shut down as the company accelerates its shift towards electric vehicle production. A VW spokesperson cited the plant's urban location as a hindrance to expanding EV manufacturing capabilities. This move reflects the broader strategic transformation within the automotive industry as major manufacturers pivot away from traditional combustion engines.</p>

          <p>Politicians from Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have caused significant outrage during a parliamentary debate marking the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. An AfD member questioned whether the event constituted genocide, arguing that only men were killed, a statement that ignores historical facts and court rulings. The remarks were condemned by other parties as revisionist history, leading to a formal apology to Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambassador who was present. The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding historical memory and the rise of far-right rhetoric in Germany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author Katie Gatti Tassin, in her book "Rich Girl Nation," describes the significant financial burden of beauty standards on women as a "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements is an insidious force, creating a cycle of recurring expenses on what are essentially depreciating assets. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true impact and then experimenting with cutting back. The saved money, she advises, can then be used more effectively to pay down debt, build savings, or invest for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Unite union has signaled a potential rupture in its relationship with the Labour Party, with its leader Sharon Graham stating that working people are turning away from the party "in droves." The conflict escalated after the union suspended the membership of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over her handling of ongoing bin strikes in Birmingham. Unite, a major financial backer of Labour, voted to reconsider its affiliation, raising the possibility of cutting ties and funding. The dispute highlights deep tensions between the new Labour government and its traditional trade union base over workers' rights and public sector disputes.</p>

Reports from the facility allege inhumane conditions including a lack of sanitation, maggot-infested food, and inadequate shelter from the elements.

          <h2>Immigration Raids in Los Angeles Create Secondary Crisis for Abandoned Pets</h2>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area are creating a secondary crisis for pets left behind when their owners are detained or deported. Animal rescue organizations and shelters report a surge in pleas for help, with many pets being abandoned in empty homes or surrendered to already overcrowded facilities. The situation is exacerbated by the fear within immigrant communities, which leads some to avoid seeking veterinary care for their animals. This "collateral damage" of the current political climate is placing an additional strain on an already stressed animal welfare system.</p>

          <p>In response to an unprecedented swarm of over 1,700 tremors in the Tokara Islands, Japan's government has approved significant upgrades to its earthquake and tsunami defense plans. While authorities state the current swarm is not a precursor to the feared Nankai Trough megaquake, they acknowledge such a disaster is inevitable. The new plans aim to cut the projected death toll from a major Nankai event by 80% within a decade through infrastructure improvements and public education. Experts emphasize the importance of rapid evacuation, as a tsunami could strike some coastal areas within five minutes of a quake.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order restricting some of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics in several counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling bars federal agents from making arrests based solely on factors like race or accent without reasonable suspicion. The decision came in a lawsuit from advocacy groups accusing agents of unconstitutional methods like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating its agents are removing dangerous criminals and will continue to enforce the law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pursuing a radical and unpredictable trade policy by sending letters to foreign leaders, informing them of new tariff rates set to take effect on August 1. This approach follows a 90-day "pause" on global tariffs, during which few new deals were made. The letters outline significant tariffs on major trading partners but leave room for negotiation, suggesting rates could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers. This strategy creates significant policy uncertainty for global markets and deviates from traditional trade negotiation protocols. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods in Texas, this guide provides practical advice for people across the U.S. on how to assess their home's flood risk. As climate change increases the frequency of flooding, many are unknowingly in harm's way, partly because 14 states have no flood disclosure laws for home sales. The article recommends asking about a property's flood history, using online tools like Realtor.com or FEMA's maps to check future risk, and understanding the costs and requirements of flood insurance. It stresses that official FEMA maps can be outdated and may not account for future climate-driven risks.</p>

During a roundtable, Trump dismissed a question about the effectiveness of warning systems as "evil" and lauded the heroic efforts of first responders and local officials. The visit occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty regarding the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which the administration has previously proposed overhauling to place more responsibility on states.

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad has found that the plane's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, starving the engines of fuel. Cockpit voice recordings captured one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, with the other denying having done so. The investigation is now focused on why this happened, as these switches are typically only used after landing or in an emergency. The report noted a 2019 FAA bulletin about a potential issue with the switch design, but it was not a mandatory directive.</p>

Analysts suggest the party, which is surging in polls, is wary of being too closely associated with a US leader who is unpopular with many French voters and whose tariff policies could harm their blue-collar base. This careful balancing act is part of the party's broader strategy to "normalize" its image and appeal to mainstream voters, distinguishing its approach from other European far-right leaders who have more warmly embraced Trump.</p>
