          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug Mounjaro demonstrated superior health outcomes compared to its older treatment, Trulicity, in a major clinical trial. While Mounjaro showed a modest 8% reduction in major cardiovascular events, it significantly lowered the risk of death from any cause by 16% and provided greater kidney protection. This data strengthens Mounjaro's case as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients, especially as Trulicity's patent nears expiration. The results are expected to bolster insurance coverage for the more expensive but more effective drug. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's inflation rate fell to 1.8% in July, a more significant dip than economists had anticipated and down from 2% in June. This brings the rate below the European Central Bank's target, providing some relief amid economic uncertainty. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained unchanged at 2.7%, and services inflation eased only slightly. The data comes as Germany's economy shows signs of contraction, with GDP shrinking by 0.1% in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

While some technical details are still being finalized, he expressed confidence in resolving the issues ahead of an August 12 tariff deadline. The negotiations, described as "tough," aim to de-escalate the trade conflict that has seen both nations impose significant duties on each other's goods. The potential agreement comes amid U.S. concerns over China's ties with Iran and its technological support for Russia.</p>

The barrage involved over 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles, with one strike causing the collapse of a residential apartment building. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack as a demonstrative act of violence, occurring despite international calls for a ceasefire. The assault represents one of the largest on the capital since the war began, intensifying the conflict's toll on civilians.</p>

          <p>Amir Hassan, a Republican running for Congress in Michigan's 8th District, has unveiled a proposal to eliminate income taxes for first responders earning under $100,000 annually. The plan would apply to nurses, teachers, firefighters, and police officers, aiming to incentivize these professions and reward their community service. Hassan, a Navy veteran, is challenging incumbent Democrat Kristen McDonald-Rivet in a key swing district that voted for Donald Trump in 2024. The proposal is part of his platform to bring new economic strategies to a district long represented by Democrats.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook, projecting a net negative impact of $2 billion from U.S. trade tariffs. The automaker had previously suspended its guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding the duties. The new forecast reflects a total tariff hit of $3 billion, with the company expecting to mitigate $1 billion through various efforts. Despite beating second-quarter revenue expectations, Ford's updated guidance for adjusted earnings is lower than its pre-tariff estimates, highlighting the significant financial pressure the auto industry faces from ongoing trade policies.

          <p>An attempt in Taiwan to recall 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with all targeted officials retaining their seats. The recall campaign, led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had framed the issue as a fight to "resist China, protect Taiwan." Analysts suggest that the failure of the recall has averted a potential escalation in cross-strait tensions. A successful recall might have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of overwhelming anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance toward the island.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced upcoming 25% tariffs on Indian goods and warned of further penalties due to India's significant purchases of Russian oil and military equipment. President Trump linked the move to India's role as a key trading partner with Russia at a time when the U.S. is trying to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine. This development puts India, a major U.S. partner, in a difficult position and raises concerns about rising costs and diplomatic friction between the two nations, despite previously strong relations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is set to review the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The case challenges the president's authority to levy such duties, a power the Constitution traditionally vests in Congress. A lower trade court had previously blocked the tariffs, but the appeals court allowed them to be temporarily reinstated. The outcome of this major legal battle, which is likely to reach the Supreme Court, will have significant implications for executive power.</p>

          <p>An international scientific team led by China has discovered the deepest known life habitat on Earth, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. At depths of up to 9,500 meters, researchers found extensive communities of tubeworms and molluscs. These organisms thrive in complete darkness by using chemosynthesis, a process that converts chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulphide from tectonic faults into energy. The finding challenges existing models of life at extreme limits and suggests such communities may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>

In her statement, Harris acknowledged that the party's traditional "playbook" has often failed and called for new methods and fresh thinking to address the nation's crises. This decision allows her to engage in political and policy debates from outside elected office. Allies suggest she will likely focus on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections and may be positioning herself as a key figure in reshaping the party's strategy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Emil Bove, a lawyer known for his loyalty to Donald Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Court of Appeals. The confirmation proceeded despite a letter from over 80 retired judges and allegations from multiple whistleblowers questioning his fitness for the judiciary. Critics raised concerns about Bove's alleged disregard for court orders and his role in firing prosecutors, arguing his confirmation sets a dangerous precedent of rewarding personal fealty over judicial independence. His supporters dismissed the opposition as a politically motivated campaign.</p>
