          <p>Amid calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine, the EU has formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions on Russia. The conditions of the talks are currently unclear, as Russia has called for "compromises" from Ukraine, and Kyiv rejects any withdrawal of its forces from its territory forcibly annexed by Russia. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called for "consequences" from Washington if Moscow "doesn't agree on an unconditional ceasefire."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government secured trade deals with the EU and the US, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the article suggests these deals required concessions, highlighting Britain's weakened standing as a midsize economy squeezed between larger trading blocs. The agreements include benefits such as easier travel for Britons in Europe and reduced tariffs on British luxury cars in the US, but also involve politically sensitive trade-offs like allowing European fishing in British waters. While the deals offer some economic benefits, they do not fully compensate for the economic impact of Brexit, leaving Britain to navigate a complex global trade environment.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old Utah man, Dominic Christopher Garcia, was arrested after allegedly holding his girlfriend and her family captive for six months by falsely claiming they were targets of a cartel.

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a bill to prevent the U.S. military from using a Boeing 747 offered by Qatar as a temporary Air Force One.

President Trump defended accepting the gift, stating it would save taxpayers money and reward Qatar for its successful defense by the U.S. The proposal faces slim chances of passage due to Republican control of Congress and the potential for a presidential veto.</p>

          <p>Emergency departments in the U.S. are facing a crisis due to a surge in "boarders," patients waiting for beds on traditional hospital wards, leading to overcrowding and compromised care. This situation negatively impacts patient outcomes, increases costs, and frustrates staff. A recent study highlights the detrimental effects on emergency medicine residents' training, leading to anxiety and diminished confidence. The article calls for systemic changes, including increased investment in beds, staffing, and aftercare capacity, to reclaim the ER as a place for healing and learning.</p>
