          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports, a reduction from a previously threatened 32% rate. As part of the purported deal, Indonesia would allegedly purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as dozens of Boeing jets. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet publicly confirmed the terms, creating some uncertainty around the finality of the agreement.</p>

She appeared to yell at the official but managed to avoid receiving a technical foul for her actions. Clark later left the game with under two minutes remaining after appearing to re-injure her groin, raising concerns about her health ahead of the All-Star Game.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of non-citizen convicts to Eswatini, a country they are not from, as part of an expanding and controversial policy. The men, convicted of serious crimes including murder and child sexual assault, hailed from nations that refused to accept their return. This practice of using third-party countries for deportations has drawn criticism from human rights advocates who raise legal and humanitarian concerns about the deportees' fate.</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who was wrongfully imprisoned for over 20 years for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit revealed significant flaws in the original case. The initial investigation relied on unreliable witness testimony and ignored both his alibi and a physical injury that made firing a gun unlikely.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be retitled as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. Prompted by safety concerns, the review also suggests that these professionals should wear standardized uniforms and not be responsible for diagnosing patients. These recommendations aim to clarify the scope and responsibilities of roles that were created to support doctors but have sparked debate over their boundaries.</p>

A primary goal of the ambitious makeover is to upgrade the heating and insulation systems to make the landmark building, which opened in 1848, net-zero in its energy emissions.</p>

The retrial, long sought by his family, forces a national re-examination of a pivotal and deeply polarizing event in South Korean history.</p>
