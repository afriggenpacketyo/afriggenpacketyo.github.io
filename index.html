          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Mike Waltz, the current national security advisor, as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, confirming reports of Waltz's departure from his current role. This decision follows controversy surrounding Waltz's creation of a Signal messaging app chat, which was used by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reveal U.S. military plans. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as the interim national security advisor. Waltz, a former House representative, is expected to prioritize national interests in his new role, as stated by Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that any country purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran would face immediate secondary sanctions, preventing them from doing business with the United States.

The move has already impacted global oil markets, with U.S. crude oil futures and Brent crude both experiencing a rise.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing a policy requiring all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials before licensure.

Some health experts have raised ethical concerns about placebo trials, arguing that they could expose people to preventable illnesses.

          <p>A federal judge in the Southern District of Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals, deeming the White House's use of the statute illegal. The judge ruled that the Act, intended for times of war or invasion, was improperly applied to modern immigration policy and the activities of a Venezuelan street gang. While the ruling only applies to Venezuelan immigrants in that district, it may influence other cases involving the Act's use. The ACLU praised the decision, emphasizing that the president cannot declare an invasion to invoke wartime authority during peacetime.</p>

Ukraine sees economic incentives as a way to interest the US in its defense, but the deal is limited.

While the agreement's significance is limited, even very limited gains will be welcomed and exploited at a time of such peril.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's recent comments about a possible third term, it's worth examining the history of presidents seeking more than two terms. While George Washington set the precedent of stepping down after two terms, Franklin D. Roosevelt broke that tradition, winning both a third and fourth term. The 22nd Amendment now limits presidents to two terms, but Trump's allies have suggested creative ways to circumvent this, including running for vice president.
