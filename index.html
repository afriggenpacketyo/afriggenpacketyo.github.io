            <p>With Birmingham facing a mounting rubbish crisis due to an ongoing bin strike, the city council has declared a major incident and requested assistance from neighboring authorities. In response to a government appeal, army logistics planners have been deployed to provide support, although soldiers will not be directly involved in waste collection. Striking Unite union members are scheduled to vote on a proposed deal aimed at resolving the month-long dispute, while government officials emphasize their commitment to addressing public health risks associated with the uncollected waste.</p>

            <p>Growing frustration is emerging in the UK regarding the aggressive tariff policies pursued by the US, policies that are feared to exacerbate the UK's cost of living crisis. While the UK is directly impacted by new US duties, the indirect effects, such as undermining investor confidence and disrupting supply chains, are also a major concern. The tariffs are also expected to slow global growth, which will affect the British economy, especially for those in the export sector.</p>

            <p>A new TikTok trend called "Dinosaur Time" has emerged, encouraging people to consume more vegetables by shoving fistfuls of greens into their mouths, often straight from the bag. The trend, possibly started by a former science teacher, aims to make eating vegetables easier and more fun, addressing the fact that only 1 in 10 Americans meet the daily recommendations for vegetable intake. While nutritionists support the idea of incorporating more greens into diets, they also suggest alternative methods for those who find eating raw greens unappealing.</p>

            <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under Elon Musk, abruptly canceled a program called Charting My Path for Future Success, which aimed to support students with disabilities transitioning from high school to college or work. The decision has left students and families devastated, as the program offered intensive support and showed promising early results. While DOGE cited concerns about the program's cost and implementation, families and educators argue that Charting My Path could have helped millions of vulnerable teens achieve their goals.</p>

            <p>Immigrants across the U.S. without legal status are grappling with the decision of whether to self-deport amid the Trump administration's policies. The administration's actions, including multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns and stricter enforcement, aim to make life difficult for immigrants, prompting some to consider returning to their home countries. While self-deportation is not a new concept, the current political climate has intensified the debate, leaving families torn between staying in the U.S. and facing potential deportation.</p>

            <p>As tariffs reshape supply chains, consumers are increasingly scrutinizing the "Made in USA" label to support domestic businesses or avoid import taxes. However, intricate trade rules and global manufacturing networks complicate the meaning of the label, which requires that "all or virtually all" of a product originates in the United States. Bilateral trade agreements and the "substantial transformation" test further influence the determination of a product's country of origin, making it difficult to ascertain the true extent of domestic production.</p>

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, a friendly bacteria residing in the large intestine, plays a vital role in maintaining gut health and preventing obesity. This bacteria thrives on mucin, a mucus layer protecting the intestine, and its presence is associated with a strong gut barrier and a balanced immune system. Research indicates that individuals with metabolic diseases often have lower levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, highlighting the importance of a fiber-rich diet to support its growth and maintain a healthy gut microbiome.</p>
