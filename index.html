          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in sex trafficking minors alongside Jeffrey Epstein. The court's decision on Monday means her 2021 conviction for abetting the sexual abuse of underage girls will stand. The justices did not provide any comment or disclose the vote count on the decision to deny the appeal. This legal finality comes amid ongoing public criticism directed at the government for not releasing all investigative files related to the Epstein case.</p>

Their research identified regulatory T-cells and the controlling gene Foxp3, which are crucial for preventing the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This work has opened a new field of immunology, paving the way for innovative treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer. The trio will share the prize money of approximately $1.2 million, celebrating a major advancement in medical science.</p>

          <p>In an economic climate marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option, with top accounts offering returns that outpace the current inflation rate. This article provides an overview of current CD rates, noting a significant difference between national averages and the higher yields available from online banks. It highlights the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones. The piece suggests strategies like laddering CDs to maximize returns while maintaining liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

This could result in longer security lines and flight delays, similar to what occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown.

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated that she is "not afraid" despite facing regular protests and serious security threats, including a foiled assassination plot against her colleague Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Barrett explained that she has learned to remain emotionally detached from the protests and criticism, viewing it as a logistical issue rather than a personal attack. She emphasized that this disciplined mindset is crucial for her work, allowing her to make legal decisions based on her originalist judicial philosophy without being swayed by public pressure or emotion.</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov indicates that talk show host Jimmy Kimmel has a higher net favorability rating than former President Donald Trump. The survey was conducted after Kimmel was temporarily suspended from his ABC show in September following criticism from the Trump administration. The suspension, prompted by threats from the FCC, sparked a public backlash and calls for a boycott, leading to Kimmel's reinstatement. The poll found Kimmel with a +3 net favorability, while Trump registered a -13, a 16-point difference between the two figures.</p>

          <p>The government of Ghana is facing significant domestic backlash over its agreement to accept West African nationals deported from the United States. Critics, including the parliamentary minority, argue the deal is unconstitutional, a threat to national security, and was made without proper legislative ratification. The government defends its decision on humanitarian and pan-African grounds, though some of the first deportees have sued for unlawful detention. The controversy highlights the complexities and legal challenges surrounding third-country deportation deals being pursued by the Trump administration.</p>

On defense, she advocates for higher military spending, a stance that may be moderated by coalition partners concerned about relations with China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new historical sci-fi drama titled "Mascogos" is set to premiere, shedding light on the under-told story of the Mascogo people. This community is descended from Black Seminoles who escaped slavery in the 19th-century United States and found freedom by settling in Coahuila, Mexico. The play follows a modern-day Chicago teen who is transported back to 1864, exploring themes of history, identity, and the search for freedom. The Mascogo people were officially recognized as an Indigenous tribe by the Coahuila government in 2017, though their community continues to face modern challenges.</p>

Borrowers who have been making payments for 20 to 25 years are now receiving notifications that their remaining debt will be cancelled. The pause was initiated to assess the impact of court decisions that blocked the separate SAVE repayment plan. The resumption of IBR discharges is a key issue in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers against the administration over its handling of student debt relief programs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a proposal to give young people a £5,000 tax rebate from their first job to help them save for a home deposit. Under the "First Job Bonus" plan, the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions would be redirected into a savings account. The party also pledged to abolish business rates for many high street retail, hospitality, and leisure firms. The Conservatives claim these policies would be funded by a £47 billion savings drive achieved through cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.</p>
