          <p>A 23-year-old passenger was arrested after a SkyWest flight from Omaha to Detroit was diverted to Cedar Rapids, Michigan. The pilot reported to air traffic control that the passenger was fighting with a flight attendant and attempting to open an emergency exit door mid-flight. The individual faces multiple charges, including disorderly conduct and assault, with the possibility of additional federal charges pending an ongoing investigation. The flight, carrying 67 passengers, was able to continue to its destination after the disruptive passenger was removed by law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Handling of Epstein Scandal May Be Eroding His MAGA Support</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's dismissive stance on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is creating an unprecedented rift within his loyal base. Unlike past controversies, his attempts to deflect and label the issue a hoax are failing to quell criticism from key MAGA influencers and podcasters. The author suggests this specific issue resonates deeply with supporters who expected him to expose elite corruption, and his failure to do so is perceived as a cover-up. The piece concludes that while Trump may survive this, it has damaged his "Teflon" image and revealed a potential vulnerability in his political armor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Human Rights Watch researcher argues against the Trump administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Haitians. The author contends that the administration's claim of improved conditions in Haiti is false, citing extreme gang violence, a high homicide rate, and a collapsing public order. The article points out the contradiction in the U.S. government simultaneously urging its own citizens to evacuate Haiti while planning to deport Haitians back into the crisis. Ending TPS would not only endanger deportees but could also further destabilize Haiti, which is counter to U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>Representative Addison McDowell has introduced the "BIDEN Act," a legislative proposal aimed at banning the use of an autopen for signing significant presidential documents. The bill specifies that engrossed bills, executive orders, pardons, and commutations must be physically signed by the president. This move is a direct response to controversies surrounding former President Joe Biden's use of the device, which critics alleged was a sign of diminished capacity. The proposed law would retroactively nullify any such documents signed by an autopen, seeking to ensure that a president is personally authorizing major executive actions.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests the 2028 Democratic presidential primary is unofficially underway, with potential candidates already positioning themselves within the party's main ideological camps. One camp consists of centrists who believe the party has become too progressive, while the other comprises populists who advocate for more aggressive, left-leaning policies. The article identifies potential contenders like Ruben Gallego, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and various governors, noting their early efforts to build support and define their message. Ultimately, the contest will be about who can best address the party's structural challenges and successfully appeal to a broad base of Democratic voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appointed John Sarcone III as a "special attorney to the attorney general" to allow him to remain as the top federal prosecutor in New York's northern district. This move circumvents a federal judicial panel's refusal to make his interim appointment permanent. The appointment has drawn criticism for bypassing traditional Senate confirmation processes and for keeping Sarcone in power despite controversies, including questions about his legal residency and credibility. Legal experts question the use of the "special attorney" statute for this purpose, viewing it as another example of the administration working around established oversight mechanisms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's directive to hire 10,000 new ICE officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents faces significant logistical and ethical challenges, according to experts and historical precedent. A similar, smaller hiring push during his first term failed to meet its goals, and past rapid hiring sprees have led to corruption and misconduct. Experts point to difficulties in recruiting qualified candidates, long hiring times, and lower pay compared to other law enforcement agencies as major hurdles.

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported that serious water pollution incidents from water companies in England increased by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest level on record. There were 75 incidents classified as causing serious or persistent harm, up from 47 the previous year, with Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water being the primary offenders. A parliamentary committee described the situation as "woeful," blaming years of underinvestment and weak regulation for the rampant sewage discharges. The report comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, as consumer bills are set to rise to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil who famously completed a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, has died at the age of 56. The accident occurred during a paragliding flight in Porto Sant Elpidio, Italy. Baumgartner became a global icon after he ascended 24 miles in a helium balloon and became the first human to break the sound barrier in free fall. Throughout his career, he was known for numerous extreme stunts, including record-setting BASE jumps from landmarks like the Petronas Towers and the Christ the Redeemer statue, cementing his legacy as a pioneer of extreme sports.</p>

The Democrats accuse the administration of misleading courts and Congress about the agreement, which was used to deport over 200 alleged gang members under a wartime authority.

          <p>Estonia has become a global model for digital governance, offering nearly all public services online, from filing taxes to initiating a divorce. A new report highlights how the small Baltic nation achieved a user adoption rate of over 90% for its e-government services, compared to much lower rates in countries like Germany. Key to Estonia's success is a user-friendly, secure e-ID system that provides access to both public and private sector services, and a "once-only principle" where citizens provide data to the government just once. This comprehensive approach has streamlined bureaucracy, saved taxpayer money, and set a benchmark for digital transformation across Europe.</p>

          <p>A hosepipe and sprinkler ban is now in effect for over 1.4 million South East Water customers in Kent and Sussex due to record-level demand for drinking water. The restriction follows an extended period of warm, dry weather and aims to conserve water for essential use. Under the ban, using hosepipes for activities like watering gardens, washing cars, or filling pools is prohibited, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. This is one of several bans being implemented across England as the country grapples with drought conditions after its second-driest spring on record.</p>

In some cases, valuable rare earths were declared as low-value products like nickel powder or even hidden inside mannequins to evade detection.

However, the benefits are skewed towards higher earners, with the top 20% of households receiving about 60% of the total tax breaks, translating to a more significant boost to their after-tax income compared to lower-income households.

Without these subsidies, the average enrollee could see their out-of-pocket premium costs rise by over 75%, potentially leading many healthier individuals to drop coverage.
