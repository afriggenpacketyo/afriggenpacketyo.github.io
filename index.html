          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has dismissed a $21,600 copyright claim against Pinkfong's viral hit "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 song copied his 2011 rendition, but the court ruled his version lacked sufficient originality for protection, upholding previous decisions. Both songs are based on a traditional children's melody, confirming Pinkfong's stance that their song is in the public domain. This ruling concludes a multi-year legal battle over the globally popular children's song.</p>

          <p>Over 115 education scholars have condemned Harvard Education Publishing Group's cancellation of a special journal issue on Palestine, labeling it "censorship." The issue, planned to address education-related questions amidst the Gaza conflict, was scrapped after the publisher demanded an unprecedented "risk assessment" by Harvard's general counsel. Critics argue this decision, which the publisher attributes to internal misalignment and editing needs, sets a dangerous precedent and exemplifies "anti-Palestinian discrimination" in academia. This incident highlights ongoing pressures on academic freedom, particularly concerning Palestinian narratives.</p>

          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and MSF, have jointly called on Israel to cease the "weaponization of aid" in Gaza, citing deepening starvation. They report increasing denials for aid delivery unless stricter Israeli regulations are met, which include demands for detailed Palestinian staff information and prohibitions against "delegitimizing" Israel. While Israel denies restrictions, stating rules prevent Hamas involvement, aid groups report significant rejections, leaving hospitals without supplies and contributing to deaths from hunger. This situation highlights a critical humanitarian crisis and ongoing disputes over aid access.</p>

          <p>Singapore's reputation for financial prudence is strained as 60% of workers now live paycheck to paycheck, higher than regional peers. Rising living costs, including expensive housing and import reliance, are cited as key factors, with real median employment income falling post-pandemic. Experts also point to deeper social shifts, such as increased aspirational spending and less urgency to save among younger generations. This trend reflects a broader "debt society" where immediate gratification often overrides long-term financial planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Xiluodu Mega Dam Shifts from Western Industrial Chips Citing Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>China's Xiluodu hydropower station, the world's fourth-largest dam, has transitioned away from Western industrial chips, citing national security concerns. This strategic shift is driven by growing alarm over vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus. The move aims to reduce reliance on foreign technology for critical infrastructure, ensuring greater domestic control over essential components. This decision reflects a broader global trend of nations prioritizing self-reliance in sensitive technological sectors, reshaping international supply chains.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has threatened to sue Hunter Biden for over $1 billion for claiming she was introduced to Donald Trump by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers describe the claim as "false, disparaging, defamatory, and inflammatory," causing "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." Hunter Biden made the comments during an interview, attributing them to a journalist whose story on the matter was later retracted. The Trumps maintain they were introduced by a modeling agent in 1998, and there is no evidence of Epstein's involvement.</p>
