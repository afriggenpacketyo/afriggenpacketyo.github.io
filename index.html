        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities. The charges stem from an incident in April where Dugan is accused of misdirecting federal agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant, who was in her courtroom for a hearing on misdemeanor domestic abuse charges. Dugan's attorneys argue she is entitled to judicial immunity and has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, calling the charges "virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional." The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a measure to raise the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour by 2028.

The proposal, championed by labor unions, aims to ensure workers can keep up with rising costs and benefit from events like the 2028 Olympics. Some council members and business representatives fear the increased wage will lead to staff cuts and deter future investment in the city. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the expansion of state-funded healthcare benefits for low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026, as the state faces a $12 billion budget deficit. The decision is driven by higher-than-expected costs for the program and economic uncertainty related to federal tariff policies. Those already enrolled will not be affected, but new applications will be frozen, and a monthly premium of $100 will be introduced for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" starting in 2027. Newsom blamed President Trump's tariff policies for contributing to the state's financial challenges. </p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after spending over three decades incarcerated for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The decision to resentence the brothers was met with mixed reactions, with the Los Angeles County District Attorney expressing opposition. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings, before a final determination from the governor's office. </p>

          <p>Despite facing a significant budget shortfall, California is committed to maintaining state-funded health insurance for undocumented residents. Governor Newsom's decision comes as Congress considers penalizing states that provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants. The state will cap enrollment for undocumented adults starting in 2026 and introduce a monthly premium. The move is controversial, with Republicans calling for a complete reversal of the policy. California is standing by its commitment to provide healthcare to its most vulnerable residents. </p>
