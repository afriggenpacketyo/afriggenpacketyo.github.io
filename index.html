          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy vehemently condemned the "unacceptable and abusive behavior" displayed by American fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York, disclosing that his wife, Erica, was hit by a drink thrown from the crowd. McIlroy, a prominent figure on the PGA Tour, endured a particularly hostile reception throughout the tournament, which included personal insults and taunts. Despite the intense and challenging environment, Europe ultimately triumphed over the United States with a 15-13 victory, a win McIlroy celebrated as the highlight of his career year. He stressed that golf should adhere to higher standards of etiquette and sportsmanship, pledging to prevent similar incidents at the 2027 Ryder Cup in Ireland.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European party, led by President Maia Sandu, secured a decisive parliamentary majority in recent elections, a result deemed critical for the nation's future path towards the EU. The electoral process was heavily impacted by claims of "massive Russian interference," involving reported bomb scares at various polling stations and arrests related to planned unrest, which the ruling party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal elements. Despite early claims of victory by pro-Russian opposition leaders and calls for street protests, Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity garnered 50% of the vote, ensuring they can form a government without needing coalition partners. This significant outcome underscores Moldova's continued commitment to closer ties with Europe amidst regional instability and high corruption.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney voiced profound concern for his previous club, asserting it is "broken" and that he holds "no faith" in manager Ruben Amorim to reverse its declining trajectory. Speaking on a BBC podcast, Rooney sharply criticized the team's current performance, highlighting their inability to secure consecutive victories under Amorim and their lowly 14th position in the Premier League. He further lamented a perceived erosion of the club's "soul," pointing to widespread staff redundancies and a noticeable absence of fight, character, and winning desire among the players. Rooney urged the ownership, including the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, to implement substantial changes to revitalize the club.</p>

          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is strongly advocating for a significant alteration to the "envelope rule" before the next contest in Ireland in 2027, following Europe's recent triumph. This unique rule dictates that if a player from one team withdraws due to injury, a designated golfer from the opposing team must also be benched, with both sides subsequently awarded half a point for that match. Bradley voiced his profound dissatisfaction after Europe's Viktor Hovland withdrew with a neck injury, leading to a half-point allocation that he felt hindered the US team's comeback attempt. While European captain Luke Donald defended the rule as a long-standing agreement, Bradley insists it needs revision for fairness in future tournaments.</p>

          <p>At least three individuals have been confirmed dead in Arizona following devastating floods triggered by intense heavy rainfall, with reports of more people potentially missing in the rural community of Globe. The severe weather also led to a dangerous situation in Globe, as approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks were displaced and scattered throughout the area, though remarkably none ignited or exploded. Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport experienced its highest one-day rainfall total in almost seven years, marking it as the city's fourth wettest day on record since 2000. Local authorities have declared an emergency, urging residents to avoid floodwaters and focusing on ongoing search and rescue efforts for potential victims.</p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik's article critically examines Kamala Harris's new memoir, "107 Days," asserting that it inadvertently exposes a politician more concerned with the mechanics of politics and superficial presentation than with substantial policy or a unique set of values. The review characterizes Harris's presidential campaign as heavily reliant on "vibes and spectacle," rather than articulating a clear and compelling departure from an unpopular Joe Biden. Malik contends that the book demonstrates a profound lack of self-awareness, with Harris seemingly attributing her electoral defeat to external factors rather than any personal or strategic missteps. The piece ultimately suggests a broader delusion within the Democratic establishment, hindering its ability to effectively challenge Trump and Trumpism.</p>

The reporter, playing along under advice, learned the group offered up to 25% of a multi-million dollar ransom for access to their work laptop and login details. Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service operation believed to be based in Russia or allied states, claimed previous successes with insider threats and pressured the reporter with deadlines. The interaction escalated to an unsettling "MFA bombing" attempt on the reporter's phone, leading to their temporary disconnection from BBC systems as a security precaution, providing a chilling insight into evolving cybercrime tactics and insider threat risks.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This forecast emerges as China's economic momentum decelerates, with year-on-year growth potentially declining sharply towards 4% from a high base last year. The People's Bank of China's recent Monetary Policy Committee meeting reflected a subtle shift in tone, moving from "showing positive momentum" to "making strides while maintaining stability," indicative of a more cautious economic outlook. However, the data-dependent nature of PBOC decisions means inaction remains a possibility if the "around 5%” full-year growth target appears sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State regulators are grappling with the rapidly evolving landscape of AI "therapy" applications, as an increasing number of individuals turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice. New state laws vary, with Illinois and Nevada implementing outright bans on AI for mental health treatment, while Utah imposes specific limits such as mandatory disclosure requirements. Experts consistently highlight the urgent need for more robust federal regulation, given that current state laws often fail to cover generic chatbots used for therapy, which have been tragically linked to severe user harm, including instances of suicide. Both the FDA and FTC are now initiating inquiries, seeking to address critical concerns regarding marketing, potentially addictive practices, and the inherent lack of human empathy and clinical judgment in AI-driven mental health tools.</p>

          <p>The karearea, New Zealand's only native falcon, has been declared the winner of the country's annual Bird of the Year competition, garnering over 75,000 votes from 123 nations. This year's impressive voter turnout was the second highest ever, underscoring increasing global public awareness for New Zealand's endangered avian species. The karearea, known for its incredible speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, faces significant threats from habitat loss and introduced predators, with current estimates placing its population between 5,000 and 8,000. The competition serves to highlight that 80% of New Zealand's native birds are at risk, advocating for greater conservation investment amidst concerns about reduced government funding.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sony Financial Group experienced a significant surge of 36% on its market debut Monday, following its strategic spin-off from the parent company Sony Group. This move, which values the newly independent financial arm at over $6.7 billion, enables Sony Financial to independently raise its own growth capital while strategically retaining crucial brand ties with the broader Sony ecosystem. Sony Group cited competing investment demands across its entertainment and semiconductor divisions as the primary rationale for this separation. Concurrently, most broader Asian markets traded higher, though Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a decline, while the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to maintain its cash rate amidst inflation risks.

President Trump had publicly stated the troops were intended to safeguard federal property from "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." Governor Tina Kotek reiterated that no insurrection necessitates military involvement, labeling the deployment unlawful, an abuse of power, and a measure that would ultimately diminish resident safety.</p>

China Southern Airlines' reports similarly noted "financially leased" a total of just three jets as of June, with no mention of outright ownership. While the Shanghai-based firm has successfully transported over 2 million passengers since the jet's maiden commercial flight in May 2023, an independent aviation analyst suggests that Comac might be encountering significant "turbulence" in its efforts to secure adequate engines for the model.

Psychologist Suzy Reading identifies common indicators such as an extreme need for attention and reassurance, or the subtle undermining of your mood through backhanded compliments. Author Radhika Sanghani suggests that your emotional state after interactions serves as a crucial telltale sign. To effectively manage such relationships, experts recommend initiating honest conversations about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent or topics discussed, and experimenting with different activities together to shift relational dynamics, ultimately aiming to protect your personal well-being while potentially preserving the friendship.</p>

This legal challenge directly confronts over a century of settled legal precedent, including the landmark 1898 U.S. v.
