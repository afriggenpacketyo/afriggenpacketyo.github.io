The California Department of Education defended the legality of DEI efforts, arguing that state and federal laws do not prohibit the broad concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Sixteen states are attempting to comply with the order, while ten others have refused, including New York and Oregon.

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to block their access to government buildings and cancel government contracts. The firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation case against Fox News, argues that the order is a retaliatory measure for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. Susman Godfrey contends that the executive order is unconstitutional and would cause irreparable harm to their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies.

            <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has identified the possibility that an idle transmission line re-energized as the leading hypothesis for the cause of the Eaton Fire. The company is taking precautionary steps to harden other idle towers and lines to prevent similar incidents, including additional field inspections and changes to maintenance procedures. The theory suggests that induction, where the magnetic field of an active line induces current in an unconnected line, may have caused the fire.

            <p>A Los Angeles court ruled that the resentencing hearing for the Menendez brothers can proceed, despite opposition from the district attorney. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking a lesser term and potential freedom based on a California law allowing resentencing for inmates under 26 at the time of their crimes. The district attorney argued the brothers haven't fully taken responsibility, while their attorney emphasized their rehabilitation efforts in prison. The judge emphasized maintaining consistency despite leadership changes. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad, the second such execution in the state in five weeks. Mahdi, convicted of killing a police officer, chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. The state has resumed executions after a 13-year pause, utilizing both firing squads and lethal injections. Mahdi's execution is the 12th in the U.S. this year, as states explore alternative execution methods due to challenges in obtaining lethal injection drugs. Optimism score: 0</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but they also said Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. On Friday Judge Xinis directed the Trump administration to provide her with daily updates on what steps they are taking to bring Mr Garcia back to the US. The government has conceded Mr Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error", though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. Optimism score: 35</p>
