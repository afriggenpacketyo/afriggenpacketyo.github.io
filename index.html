          <p>Data from England's 2024-25 school year reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week and subsequent persistent absence. Over half of pupils partially absent in the first week went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from the start of the new term to combat what she calls a critical issue impacting a generation's future. The government is implementing support hubs to assist struggling schools in improving attendance and behavior.</p>

The gathering of the security bloc, originally formed as a counterweight to Western alliances, occurs as both nations face economic pressure from the United States. Modi held separate talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking his first visit in seven years, while Putin's arrival was met with a red-carpet welcome, highlighting close Sino-Russian ties.

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her choice to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best decision she has ever made, citing the need to prioritize her mental and physical health. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, Bright felt she was on the verge of a breakdown and could not give her full commitment to the national team. Following successful knee surgery and starting counseling, she now feels "back to life" and ready for the new Women's Super League season, emphasizing the immense pressure of leadership roles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the UK's Reform party is importing Donald Trump's strategy of restricting press access, citing a recent ban on the Nottingham Post by the Reform-led Nottinghamshire county council. The author draws parallels between this action and the Trump administration's history of banning journalists from outlets like the Associated Press. While acknowledging that press-bashing has not led to electoral consequences for Trump, the piece suggests the UK's political culture is different and that dodging scrutiny could backfire for Reform. The article posits that politicians still need established media for legitimacy and publicity.</p>

In his first visit to China in seven years, Modi met with President Xi Jinping, with both leaders expressing a commitment to improving relations based on mutual respect. The summit is particularly significant as both India and Russia face economic pressure from US tariffs and sanctions.

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee of President Trump, is stepping down from his role as the head of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure, stating his "mission accomplished." Dasgupta focused on repositioning the U.S. foreign aid agency as a strategic investment tool to counter Chinese influence and advance an "America First" agenda. He pushed for evaluating projects based on their return on investment for the U.S. and their role in strengthening national security, particularly concerning critical minerals. His departure comes as the administration continues to reframe America's global engagement, emphasizing strategic deals over traditional aid.</p>

          <p>Manchester United secured a last-minute 3-2 victory against Burnley, but the win highlighted persistent and urgent issues with the team's goalkeepers. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the team's vulnerability, stating that "with every possession near our box, they can score," a problem exacerbated by recent errors from goalkeepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. Bayindir's mistake led to Burnley's equalizing goal in the match, continuing a pattern of costly errors for the club. The article suggests these ongoing problems may push the club to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer deadline closes.</p>

Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava and the running game failed to establish consistent momentum, with the team converting only a fraction of its third downs.

This creative approach comes as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West, leading to increased conflict with ranchers. While preliminary results show the drones can successfully interrupt wolf hunts, the high cost of the technology and the possibility of wolves becoming habituated to it remain significant challenges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her statement follows a recent raid near a Westlake Home Depot, one of several targeting parking lots that are common gathering places for day laborers. Jurado argued that Home Depot's silence on the repeated use of its property for these operations amounts to complicity. In response, a company spokesperson stated that Home Depot is not notified of or requesting these operations and is required to follow all federal laws.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights in anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order seeks to prevent city police from being deputized by federal authorities and prohibits federal agents from wearing masks while operating in the city. This preemptive action comes amid reports of a possible "militarized" federal presence, similar to operations seen in other cities like Los Angeles. While largely symbolic, the mayor stated the city would use all available legal tools to counter federal actions that violate residents' rights.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report details the murder-for-hire plot orchestrated by Dino Guglielmelli, a wealthy supplement company owner who attempted to have his wife, Monica Olsen, killed. Amid a bitter divorce, Guglielmelli offered his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, $80,000 to carry out the murder. Fuhrmann, who Guglielmelli believed had a military background suitable for the task, instead cooperated with authorities to expose the plot. Fuhrmann secretly recorded a conversation in which Guglielmelli confirmed his desire for his wife to be killed, leading to his arrest and a nine-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory over Missouri State, a Football Championship Subdivision opponent. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, generating over 700 total yards and several long touchdown plays, while the defense recorded five sacks and a pick-six by safety Bishop Fitzgerald. While the lopsided score provided an opportunity to play many backups, the level of competition made it difficult to gauge the team's true strength.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece reflects on the complexities of blame in the death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, who overdosed on heroin provided by Alix Tichelman. The author questions whether Hayes would have faced the same legal consequences as Tichelman if the roles had been reversed, given his status as a family man and tech executive. The article posits that Hayes was not a passive victim, as he arranged the meeting and invited her to inject him with the drug. The author concludes that while Tichelman was legally held responsible for not seeking help, Hayes bears significant ethical responsibility for creating the fatal situation.</p>

          <p>This article details the investigation into the 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, who died from a heroin overdose on his yacht in Santa Cruz, California. Security camera footage from the yacht revealed that Hayes was with Alix Tichelman, a 26-year-old model he met through the website SeekingArrangement.com. The video showed Tichelman injecting Hayes with heroin and then, after he lost consciousness, gathering her belongings and leaving without calling for help. Police later arrested Tichelman in a sting operation, and she ultimately pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced via social media his intention to issue an executive order requiring voter identification for every vote cast in the United States, with "NO EXCEPTIONS." He also reiterated his call to eliminate mail-in voting, except for military personnel and those who are severely ill. This move is consistent with his long-standing, false claims of widespread voter fraud in the U.S. electoral system. However, since federal elections are administered by individual states, it is constitutionally unclear whether the president has the authority to unilaterally enact such a sweeping mandate through an executive order.</p>

          <p>While Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is experiencing a significant drop in public favorability, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is seeing a rise in its own popularity. A recent poll shows the KMT's favorability rating has surpassed the DPP's, and public discontent with the ruling party has reached a new high. Despite this apparent opportunity, the KMT is reportedly consumed with anxiety over who will succeed current chairman Eric Chu Li-luan when he steps down in October. The leadership role is seen by some within the party as a "poisoned chalice," creating internal uncertainty.</p>
