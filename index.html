          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Mondelēz International has announced the discontinuation of the Toblerone dark chocolate bar in the UK after nearly 60 years, citing changing consumer tastes and business growth strategies. The company stated it continuously adapts its range and invests in Toblerone, though it did not specify if the discontinuation would affect other regions or sizes. The original Toblerone bar was created in 1908, with the dark chocolate version introduced in 1969. This decision coincides with rising cocoa prices impacting the chocolate industry, especially leading into the Easter holiday weekend.</p>

This year has seen a significant increase in Channel crossings, with over 9,000 people making the journey so far, marking a 42% rise compared to the same period last year, as the government vows to crack down on people-smuggling across the Channel.</p>

            <p>Current CD interest rates offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than the current inflation rate, with long-term CDs allowing investors to lock in rates for up to 5 or 10 years. While national averages for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs are around 2%, some online banks offer rates as high as 4.50% for shorter terms like 6-month and 1-year CDs. Experts recommend considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The IRS is reportedly considering revoking Harvard University’s tax-exempt status amid the Trump administration's demands regarding DEI and other issues. The White House has already frozen billions in grants and contracts after Harvard refused to comply with demands to end DEI programs and adopt merit-based admissions. The Department of Homeland Security is also threatening to revoke Harvard's student visa program. Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and endanger its educational mission.</p>

The Liquor Control Board of Ontario has halted purchases of U.S. products, and the tariffs are causing emotional distress among Canadian businesses.</p>

The order requires DOGE to delete non-anonymized data and remove software from SSA systems, while non-DOGE SSA staff and DOGE members using anonymized data remain unaffected.</p>

            <p>This morning's headlines include a deadly shooting at Florida State University, where two people were killed and six injured. Also in the news, President Trump is criticizing the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, even as his tariffs make that more difficult. A Maryland senator met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was illegally deported to El Salvador last month.
