          <p>Germany is undertaking a significant project to remove an estimated 1.6 million tons of unexploded World War II munitions from its coastal waters.  This initiative is driven by growing concerns about environmental contamination and the risk of accidental explosions.  The project involves the development of an autonomous platform for retrieving and disposing of the weapons, addressing a long-neglected issue. This innovative approach may serve as a model for other countries facing similar challenges.</p>
