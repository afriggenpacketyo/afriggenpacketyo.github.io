        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are encountering challenges in passing President Trump's tax bill, officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, due to disagreements over spending cuts, Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions (SALT). Some right-wing lawmakers want deeper cuts to reduce the national debt, while others object to Medicaid cuts, fearing they would harm lower-income constituents. Lawmakers from high-tax states are also pushing for a higher SALT deduction cap, with House Republican leaders seeking a compromise to raise the cap to $40,000 for individuals and $80,000 for joint filers, but it is still not enough. The bill has passed the budget committee, but still needs to pass the House and Senate.</p>

          <p>Morrisons, a major UK supermarket chain, anticipates that the recent UK-EU trade deal will alleviate pressure on food prices by removing trade barriers and simplifying import processes. The deal sets out post-Brexit relations on areas including fishing rights, farming exports, trade, travel, and defense. Other business groups, including the CBI and BCC, have also praised the agreement as a positive step forward, but emphasize the need for further improvements to strengthen UK-EU business relations. While retailers hope to pass on cost savings to consumers, price reductions will depend on suppliers also reducing their prices, which is not guaranteed.</p>

          <p>As New York City heads towards its mayoral primary, candidates are navigating the complex issue of antisemitism, which has gained prominence amid rising hate crimes against Jewish people and the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is using antisemitism as a political tool against opponents, while other candidates like Brad Lander and Zohran Mamdani are attempting to strike a balance between supporting Jewish constituents and addressing concerns about Israel's policies. The UJA-Federation of New York is surveying candidates on their commitment to combating antisemitism, highlighting the issue's significance for Jewish voters, who represent a substantial portion of the electorate. Overall, the candidates are actively trying to gain the support of the Jewish voters, but disagree on methods.</p>

The agreement also sets the stage for greater British involvement in European defense efforts, including a loan program for joint procurement and investment.

          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulent trading as U.S. stocks and bonds were sold off, and the dollar weakened following a credit rating downgrade by Moody's and growing concerns about government debt. Moody's cited the tax cut legislation and broader concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs as reasons for the downgrade, meaning that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings. Higher rates are expected to push up the value of the dollar, but the currency has slid against the euro, yen, and others. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said the Moody’s downgrade would “have implications for the cost of capital and a bunch of other things.”</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the downgrade, but bond yields climbed, signaling investor concern.

Biden's office reported that the cancer has spread to his bones but appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Davies noted that Biden's Gleason score of 9 indicates a high-risk cancer, but treatment options like hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy can extend his life. Davies emphasized that Biden's age does not necessarily limit treatment options, and that research has significantly advanced prostate cancer care in recent years.</p>

          <p>French police have recovered the long-lost bust of Jim Morrison, which had been stolen from the singer's grave in Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris 37 years ago. The sculpture was found during a search related to a fraud case led by the Paris public prosecutor's office. Morrison's grave remains a popular destination for rock fans, and the bust, created by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was originally placed there to mark the 10th anniversary of Morrison's death. The circumstances surrounding Morrison's death in 1971 remain mysterious.</p>

          <p>Greggs, a popular bakery chain, is trialing a new measure to combat shoplifting by moving self-serve food and drinks behind the counter in a few of its stores. The company said the move is being tested at locations "exposed to higher levels of anti-social behavior." This change is not expected to be implemented across all of Greggs' 2,600 bakeries in the UK, but it may be rolled out to sites with high levels of theft. The trial is taking place in Whitechapel, Peckham, and Ilford.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists recommend rethinking eating habits to improve sleep quality, suggesting that nutrients, fats, sugar, and fiber all play a role. Eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, salmon, and yogurt, can help the brain produce serotonin and melatonin, which are important for sleep. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables can also improve sleep, as fruits and veggies are good sources of fiber and sleep-supporting nutrients. Avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening and refraining from drinking alcohol or eating heavy meals right before bed are also recommended.</p>

          <p>Tesla has begun accepting trade-ins for its Cybertruck, revealing a significant depreciation in value. The 2024 Cybertruck AWD Foundation Series, originally sold for $100,000, is being offered a trade-in value of just $65,400, a depreciation of nearly 35% in a year. This depreciation is higher than the typical 20% for pickup trucks. The move comes after a tough quarter for Tesla, which saw its first-quarter profit plunge more than 70%, and reports of nearly $200 million in Cybertruck inventory the company is struggling to move.</p>

The warning came shortly after the Trump administration announced a "China trade deal" following high-level talks. China's spokesperson said the U.S. is overreaching, and that they are using unilateral protectionism to contain and isolate other countries which will ultimately undermine the competitiveness of the US industry.</p>

          <p>Researchers are puzzled by a recent trend of capuchin monkeys kidnapping howler monkey babies on an island in Panama. These young male capuchins have been observed carrying howler infants, often resulting in the infants' deaths due to lack of nourishment. The researchers believe this behavior may be a form of purposeless activity driven by boredom or curiosity. The capuchins, known for their intelligence and tool use, are being compared to humans and chimps in their capacity for seemingly pointless and destructive behaviors. The study highlights the complex social and cultural dynamics within primate communities.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has cautioned that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the real threat to U.S. Treasurys. Dalio argues that credit ratings don't account for the risk of the government printing money to pay its debt, which could cause bondholders to suffer losses due to decreased money value. He suggests that risks for U.S. government debt are greater than the rating agencies are conveying. Dalio's comments come after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing the federal government's ballooning budget deficit and soaring interest payments on the debt.</p>

The equivocation over the ground invasion reflects Mr. Netanyahu’s need to satisfy far-right cabinet ministers, who are pushing for the full re-occupation of Gaza, and Israel’s top generals, who believe such a move would be difficult to sustain and dangerous to hostages held in Gaza.</p>
