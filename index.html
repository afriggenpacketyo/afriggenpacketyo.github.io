          <p>Lyle Menendez shared a Mother's Day message on social media, expressing sympathy for those experiencing pain related to the holiday, as he and his brother Erik await resentencing for the 1989 murders of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense, alleging their father sexually abused them. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman attempted to halt the resentencing, citing new evidence suggesting the brothers pose a continued risk, but the judge allowed the proceedings to move forward. Lyle Menendez has expressed interest in working on prison reform and advocacy for survivors of childhood sexual abuse upon release.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, known for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is under strain due to a shrinking workforce and aging demographics. The system's future is becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, raising concerns about its stability and public trust. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is seeking funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased burdens on high medical cost patients. Analysts emphasize the need for measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures.</p>

          <p>Families of victims killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks are urging Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to help extradite Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi Arabian national potentially involved in the attacks. They cite recently unsealed evidence linking al-Bayoumi to the attackers. The families are requesting that Lutnick address the issue during upcoming economic talks with Saudi Arabia. Lutnick, who lost his brother in the attacks, is asked to emphasize that any partnership must begin with accountability and justice. The families point out that information about al-Bayoumi's involvement was withheld from the public and the 9/11 commission for years.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over to Japanese representatives. The return concludes a legal battle initiated by Buseoksa Temple in South Korea, which claimed the statue was plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>California, despite becoming the world's fourth-largest economy, faces significant challenges including potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies. Los Angeles grapples with a $1 billion budget shortfall and the economic strain of rebuilding after fires. The state's relationship with the federal government is strained under the Trump administration, limiting potential federal assistance. The state's political leadership finds itself at a crossroads with a new governor on the horizon. Despite these challenges, some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, drawing on its history of overcoming past disasters.</p>

The material, intended to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina during World War II, includes postcards, photographs, and propaganda. The boxes are believed to be related to 83 packages that arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941, sent by the German embassy in Tokyo. The court has ordered the preservation of the material and a thorough analysis, as Argentina is home to the largest Jewish population in Latin America and was a destination for Nazis after the war.</p>

While likely impacting only certain Medicare-covered drugs administered in offices, it could significantly reduce government spending. The proposal, which faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, revives a previous effort blocked by courts.</p>
