          <p>A judge has found Apple in contempt of court, stating that the company willfully violated a 2021 decision related to the Epic Games case. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers accused Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath about when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on certain App Store purchases. The court has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple, ordering Apple to immediately cease imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps, asserting that Apple's conduct was anticompetitive and lacked justification. The judge emphasized the seriousness of disregarding a court order.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed an economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare earth minerals, as announced by the Treasury Department. This agreement establishes a "United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund," framed as a 50/50 partnership to develop mineral, oil, and gas projects within Ukraine, and will be funded through direct investment, future U.S. aid, and revenue from new mineral licensing deals. Ukraine will retain ownership of its natural resources, and profits from the fund will be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, after which they can be distributed between the partners. This deal addresses President Trump’s interest in securing access to Ukraine's mineral resources as a means of ensuring Ukraine's stability and economic growth.</p>

          <p>The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, had filed a protective order against him in 2021 due to allegations of domestic violence. Jennifer Vasquez sought the order, claiming Abrego Garcia punched, scratched, and bruised her, although she later stated she didn't pursue the case further. Abrego Garcia's legal team acknowledged the protective order but emphasized he hasn't been criminally convicted. The Department of Homeland Security shared the protective order on X, stating Abrego Garcia is "not a sympathetic figure," after admitting to the deportation error, but Vasquez stands by Abrego Garcia, and the case continues to prompt legal and political debate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's second term is marked by an intensified "America First" policy, leading to trade wars and strained relationships with traditional allies. His administration has aggressively pursued what it views as unbalanced economic partnerships, imposing tariffs and seeking control over foreign territories like the Panama Canal and Greenland. While aiming to secure critical minerals and broker peace deals, particularly in Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Trump's approach has been criticized for undercutting allies and failing to hold Russia accountable. The administration's actions have also included significant cuts to diplomatic structures and a focus on deportation goals, raising concerns about the U.S.'s global standing and the erosion of trust.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's vow of a massive deportation operation to Mexico, data indicates that deportations are lower than the previous year under the Biden administration. This decline is attributed to decreased illegal border crossings due to Mexican intervention and Trump's policies to end asylum at the U.S. border. The administration is now focusing on deporting migrants already inside the U.S., which is more complex and costly. Mexico is also accepting deportees from other countries, but the legal status of these "third-party" migrants remains unclear, leaving them vulnerable and raising concerns among migrant advocates.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, has been released from federal custody after being detained by immigration officials seeking to rescind his green card. Judge Geoffrey Crawford drew parallels to McCarthyism in his decision, citing Mahdawi's community ties and lack of danger to the public. Despite his release, the Trump administration continues to pursue his deportation, arguing that his activism undermines the Middle East peace process. Mahdawi's lawyers and supporters celebrated the decision as a victory for dissent and free speech.</p>

Finn also discusses the shift in England's attitude towards franchise cricket, acknowledging the power players now hold to pursue lucrative opportunities like the IPL. He recalls being denied permission to enter the IPL auction in 2013, highlighting the changing priorities and player dynamics in the sport.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives, with Republican support and a few Democrats, voted to block California from implementing stricter clean air standards for trucks and zero-emission vehicle mandates. These votes challenge California's long-standing authority to set pollution standards tougher than federal ones, a power granted under the Clean Air Act due to the state's historically poor air quality. Republicans argue that California's policies dictate national policy, while Democrats and public health advocates defend the waivers as essential for reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The measures now move to the Senate, where their fate is uncertain due to legal challenges and potential defiance of Senate rules.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's historic election victory in Canada is tempered by a divided electorate, particularly a generational divide where younger voters have shifted support to the Conservatives due to concerns about housing affordability and cost of living. This contrasts with the 2015 election when young voters helped sweep Justin Trudeau to power. Carney's Liberal Party gained seats but fell short of a majority, while the Conservatives made significant gains, indicating a need for the Liberals to regain the confidence of younger voters who feel let down and frustrated. Key issues that resonated with voters depended on age, with older voters more concerned about Trump and younger voters focused on affordability.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that American children may need to sacrifice and accept fewer toys this Christmas due to his tariff policies and trade war with China. He acknowledged that supply chains could be disrupted, leading to emptier shelves in stores, particularly toy stores. This statement came as many American toymakers and retailers have begun pausing orders due to the effects of Trump's tariffs, threatening to disrupt the holiday season.

          <p>Florida is set to ban fluoride from its drinking water after new legislation passed by state lawmakers, making it the second state after Utah to do so. The bill awaits Governor Ron DeSantis' signature, who has previously called water fluoridation "forced medication." The legislation prohibits municipal authorities from adding "water quality additives" to the water supply. Despite the debate, dentists and health experts largely agree that controlled fluoride exposure is key to preventing tooth decay and poses minimal risks, with public water fluoridation considered a major public health innovation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to allow the creation of the nation's first religious charter school funded directly by taxpayer dollars during oral arguments in a case from Oklahoma. The case centers on whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools, weighing the separation of church and state against the protection of religious freedom. The court's liberal members expressed concerns about using public funds to advance a specific ideology, while conservatives suggested charter schools are private contractors providing a public service. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, potentially leading to a divided court.</p>
