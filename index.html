Maersk anticipates continued disruption in the Red Sea throughout the year and revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%.

          <p>Slovakia and Hungary have voiced strong opposition to the European Commission's plan to end all Russian gas, nuclear energy, and LNG imports by 2027, calling it a "serious mistake" that threatens the region's energy security and economy. These nations, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy, warn of higher consumer prices as a result of the ban. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico described the plan as "economic suicide," arguing against building a new Iron Curtain between the West and Russia.

          <p>President Donald Trump is anticipated to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Specifics are unclear, but the announcement follows weeks of talks aimed at lowering tariffs on US cars, farm products, and taxes on US technology companies. The UK is also prioritizing a separate agreement with the EU, which could align British standards with European ones. The announcement is expected to take place in the Oval Office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has alarmed the British film industry, which relies heavily on Hollywood blockbusters. The industry is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and strikes, and the uncertainty about tariffs could wipe out that progress. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration, while some trade experts question how such tariffs could be enforced, given the international nature of film production.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is "teaching" an online writing course for BBC Maestro, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to resurrect deceased artists. While Christie's family approved the project and insisted on using her own words, some ethicists question whether it constitutes a deepfake and whether Christie herself would have consented. The course creators emphasize that AI was used only to create her likeness, not to invent her views or write the script.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second expert testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's remains were found, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened beforehand. The expert, Jessica Hyde, used technical terms to explain her findings, which supported earlier testimony. The defense cross-examined Hyde, questioning her methodology and referencing a previous case where her reliability was challenged. The trial revolves around allegations that Read backed her car into O'Keefe, while the defense argues she did not strike him at all.</p>
