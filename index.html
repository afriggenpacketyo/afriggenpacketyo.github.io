        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end deadly border clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was reached during talks in Malaysia, chaired by the ASEAN regional bloc, following a flare-up of violence last week. The deal is seen as a crucial first step toward de-escalation, with both nations' leaders expressing a commitment to restoring peace and security. International pressure, including from the United States, played a role in bringing the parties to the negotiating table to resolve the long-disputed border issue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 06:52:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second quarter, Huawei reclaimed its status as the top smartphone seller in China for the first time since early 2024, shipping 12.2 million units for an 18% market share. Simultaneously, Apple experienced a return to growth in the critical Chinese market, with shipments increasing by 4% year-over-year. This development is a positive sign for Apple investors ahead of its earnings report, as the company has faced intense competition from local brands like Huawei. Apple's growth was reportedly aided by strategic price adjustments and trade-in offers for its iPhone 16 series. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major new trade framework between the United States and the European Union is expected to have varied impacts across different sectors and groups. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported into the U.S., is seen as a political victory for President Trump but may raise costs for American consumers. While markets reacted positively to the certainty provided by the agreement, it has exposed divisions within the EU. German carmakers face significant costs despite a tariff reduction, whereas U.S. automakers and energy sectors could see benefits from the new terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of recovery one year into the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg. The company's stock has risen over 30% this year, with increased aircraft production and deliveries suggesting a positive shift. Ortberg has navigated significant challenges, including a near-catastrophe with a 737 Max door-plug, by implementing cost cuts, resolving labor disputes, and improving customer relations. While the company still faces FAA production caps and issues in its defense unit, analysts and airline executives express renewed optimism about Boeing's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rupert Murdoch, at 94, is reportedly refusing to be intimidated by a $10 billion lawsuit from President Trump, positioning his Wall Street Journal to defend its reporting on a story involving Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. This stance contrasts with other major media outlets that have seemingly yielded to pressure from the administration. The article explores Murdoch's complex motivations, including his historical desire to back winners, his complicated relationship with Trump, and a potential legacy-defining role as an unlikely defender of press freedom. While Fox News continues to support Trump, the Journal's defiance highlights a significant rift between the media mogul and the President.</p>

          <p>This advice column explores how to approach major life choices, such as a lawyer torn between a high-paying corporate job and morally fulfilling nonprofit work. It introduces the philosophy of Ruth Chang, who argues that "hard choices" are not about finding a single correct answer but about exercising personal agency. When options are "on a par"—neither better than the other, just different—the decision-maker must create reasons for themselves, defining who they want to be. This act of choosing, rather than discovering a pre-existing best option, is presented as a fundamental and empowering aspect of the human condition.</p>

In 1963, the city of Hayward used eminent domain to forcibly remove 205 families, paying them minimal amounts for their property before razing the town for an industrial park. This act of displacement, which shattered the community and destroyed generational wealth, is part of a broader history of racial injustice in the Bay Area.

          <p>Skygazers are advised to look for meteors this week, as the Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids showers are set to peak on the night of July 29-30. This year, these lesser-known showers offer a better viewing opportunity than the more famous Perseids in August, which will be largely obscured by a bright moon. Astronomers suggest finding a dark location away from city lights after midnight for the best chance to see the combined activity of 20 to 30 meteors per hour. The Alpha Capricornids are noted for producing particularly spectacular, slow-moving fireballs across the night sky.</p>

          <p>The international use of China's yuan is growing, with a Renmin University index showing an 11% rise in its global standing in 2024, ranking it ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. This trend is part of China's strategy to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system, which is still dominated by the U.S. dollar. However, the report also highlights a new challenge to the yuan's expansion: the rise of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. These digital currencies are seen as a potential threat to China's efforts to increase the yuan's international footprint. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's stock has fallen sharply this year following poor performance in its Medicare Advantage and Optum Health units, leading to a CEO change. Investors are now keenly awaiting the company's updated 2025 earnings guidance and a clear strategy for stabilizing its physician practice unit.

          <p>An economic model from The Observatory of Economic Complexity forecasts a significant drop in global exports to the U.S. following the new trade deal with the European Union. The simulator predicts that the 15% tariff framework will cause a more than 46% decline in overall imports by 2027 compared to recent years, as countries rewire trade relationships away from the U.S. While imports from some EU nations may rise, the model projects sharp decreases from major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico. This shift could lead to reduced product diversity for American consumers as companies adjust to the new tariff landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

A Russian drone also reportedly crossed into Lithuanian airspace from Belarus.

          <p>Attorneys for immigrant children have filed court documents detailing "unsafe and unsanitary" conditions in U.S. detention facilities, where youth are allegedly held for weeks in prison-like settings.

Advocates fear that ending the Flores agreement would remove crucial transparency and oversight, potentially leading to widespread abuse and a violation of children's rights.

          <p>In a recent interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned that the Democratic party's goal should not be to simply restore the pre-Trump status quo. He argued that many government institutions were already failing Americans and that the party has been "too attached" to a system that wasn't working, which contributed to its 2024 defeat. Buttigieg suggested that while the Trump administration's actions are destructive, Democrats must embrace significant change rather than just taping the pieces of the old system back together. He also commented on the societal breakdown of trust, exemplified by the persistent public interest in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.</p>

          <p>Psychologists and nutrition experts are highlighting that some children have a naturally stronger "food reward drive," making them more susceptible to over-consuming ultra-processed foods. These children feel a greater motivation to eat and struggle with satiety signals, a trait that is particularly challenging in an environment saturated with engineered, hyper-palatable products. For these kids, standard advice may not work. Experts recommend strategies such as keeping ultra-processed foods out of the home, limiting variety, and establishing a baseline diet of whole foods, while allowing for occasional treats in social settings to foster a healthy, long-term relationship with food.</p>

Health advocates are concerned that these bureaucratic hurdles, which have cost Georgia over $91 million to implement, will be replicated in other states.
