            <p>As the United States commemorates the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the question of who fired the first shot of the American Revolution remains unanswered.

While the colonial side successfully used the event to rally support, the exact sequence of events is still debated by historians, with the incident remaining shrouded in uncertainty. Regardless, the first shot symbolizes the beginning of America's journey towards independence, adding to the legend surrounding the event.</p>

            <p>The death toll from attacks in Nigeria's Benue state has sharply risen to 56, with Governor Hyacinth Alia blaming suspected herdsmen for the violence. This recent incident is part of a larger pattern of intercommunal clashes in the Middle Belt region, often involving disputes between nomadic herders and settled farmers. Climate change-related factors like overgrazing and drought exacerbate these tensions, while Amnesty International has criticized the government for its failure to protect communities from violence. The attacks often take on a religious dimension, with farmers often Christian and the herders mostly Muslim Fulani.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting until midnight on Sunday. The announcement was met with skepticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who criticized it as a manipulative tactic. Despite the ceasefire announcement, reports indicate that fighting continued in certain regions. Russia and Ukraine also conducted a prisoner exchange mediated by the United Arab Emirates. The announcement came after the U.S. expressed frustration with the pace of peace talks.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law. The court's order follows an emergency appeal from the ACLU, arguing that the detainees were not given a chance to contest their deportation in court. The Trump administration invoked the act to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU has sued to block the deportations, citing concerns about due process and the conditions in El Salvador's prisons, where some Venezuelans have been sent.</p>

The Musk compound is still relatively bare-bones, but it is part of a broader trend of economic development in central Texas.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by recent wildfires are suing major California insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging they colluded to force homeowners into accepting the California FAIR Plan. The lawsuits claim the insurers conspired to eliminate competition and intentionally push homeowners to the FAIR Plan, which has higher premiums and lower coverage limits. The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to increasing cancellations by insurers in fire-risk zones. The plaintiffs are seeking three times the damages sustained.</p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, assessed as at "medium" risk by a police algorithm (VioGén) after reporting threats from her ex-partner, was later murdered. The case raises questions about the effectiveness and potential biases of algorithms used to assess domestic violence risk. Critics suggest police may be relying too heavily on the algorithm, and there are calls for independent audits and greater transparency. While authorities defend the system as a valuable tool, this incident highlights the limitations of relying solely on algorithms for safety assessments.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a walk-off loss to the Texas Rangers despite a solid start from pitcher Roki Sasaki, who pitched six innings and allowed only two runs. Closer Kirby Yates gave up a two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth, resulting in a 4-3 defeat. Sasaki's fastball velocity was lower than usual, but he effectively used his secondary pitches. The loss highlighted the absence of injured reliever Blake Treinen and the bullpen's struggles to close out the game.</p>
