          <p>Emails and other documents reveal that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the shooter who targeted President Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, was simultaneously planning for an engineering career and a violent act. The documents show Crooks, who killed an audience member and struck Trump's ear, was a meticulous student who impressed his professors, even designing a 3D-printed chessboard for the visually impaired. However, he also harbored skepticism towards the government and corporations, and was researching explosives. A federal grand jury subpoenaed Crooks' records before his death, raising questions about whether others were involved. </p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily blocked lower court orders that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to hand over information to a government watchdog group. The dispute stems from a Freedom of Information Act request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) seeking details about DOGE's operations and personnel. The Justice Department argues that DOGE is a presidential advisory body, while CREW contends it wields substantial independent authority, making it subject to FOIA. The temporary stay allows the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's request for emergency relief. </p>
