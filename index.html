          <p>Former Special Counsel Jack Smith has offered to testify publicly before House and Senate Judiciary Committees regarding his federal investigations into former President Trump's handling of classified documents and alleged efforts to subvert the 2020 election. His lawyers indicate Smith requires Justice Department assurance against punishment and guidance on grand jury secrecy to openly discuss the investigations and his final report. The second volume of his report, detailing Trump's document handling, has not been publicly released due to previously ongoing cases, which were later dismissed after Trump's return to the White House. Smith aims to address "mischaracterizations" of his work, which led to two criminal cases against the former president, underscoring his steadfast adherence to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines throughout his tenure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Changpeng Zhao, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering-related charge in November 2023 and served four months in prison. The White House justified the pardon by claiming Zhao was a victim of political prosecution by the Biden administration, accusing them of waging a "war on cryptocurrency" despite no fraud allegations or identifiable victims. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have labeled the pardon as corruption, citing Zhao's alleged ties to Trump family crypto investments and lobbying efforts. Trump defended the decision by stating many believed Zhao was not guilty and was unfairly persecuted by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by late weekend, posing a significant threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm's slow movement over very warm Caribbean waters is expected to bring days of heavy rain, with forecasts of 8 to 14 inches and potential for life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides. Although Melissa is not anticipated to have major impacts on the mainland United States, a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are currently in effect for Jamaica and the southwestern peninsula of Haiti, underscoring the immediate danger to these vulnerable island nations.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has maintained its top position in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's (Wipo) annual Global Innovation Index (GII) for the 15th consecutive year, while China ranked 10th overall. This outcome has sparked questions among some Chinese internet users regarding the index's methodology and authority, with doubts raised about how Switzerland consistently leads as the top innovation economy despite China's strong sci-tech output. The GII, published by a Geneva-based UN agency, is a widely recognized ranking now in its 18th edition, but its latest results have prompted discussions about potential biases in its assessment criteria and global perception.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed an executive order establishing the Illinois Accountability Commission to create a permanent public record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration enforcement agents in Chicago. Pritzker accused ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers of "unlawful attacks" targeting Black and Brown individuals under Operation Midway Blitz, with no accountability from federal superiors. The commission, led by former Chief Judge Ruben Castillo, will document impacts on communities and recommend actions to hold the federal government accountable, emphasizing that Illinois is not waiting for Washington to act. Federal officials, however, defend their actions, citing arrests of "very bad individuals."</p>

The company's chief privacy and compliance officer stated this restructuring reflects the program's maturity and aims for faster innovation while maintaining high compliance standards. While Meta emphasizes its use of basic automation over generative AI for risk decisions, this move is part of broader organizational changes, including recent cuts in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit.

Cuomo, running as an independent, echoed Adams' concerns about Mamdani's socialist policies and perceived divisiveness, especially within various communities.

The US has conducted strikes on vessels and increased a bounty for Maduro's arrest, despite international condemnation and doubts about the legality and effectiveness of these actions. Analysts believe the strategy is intended to pressure the Venezuelan military and inner circle to turn against Maduro, rather than a direct invasion.</p>

          <p>Disney has warned YouTube TV subscribers that its networks, including ABC and ESPN, may be dropped from the service by October 30 due to a stalled distribution agreement. Disney accuses Google of exploiting its position and seeking costly economic terms that would raise prices for YouTube TV customers while benefiting Disney's rival live TV products. YouTube TV, with 10 million subscribers, is seeking better rates and the ability to integrate Disney's streaming content onto its platform, a request Disney has rejected. This dispute highlights ongoing tensions between content providers and streaming services over carriage fees and platform control, potentially impacting millions of viewers.</p>

          <p>Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs, marking its first major layoffs in a decade, as the retailer aims to regain growth after four years of stagnant sales. The reductions, affecting about 8% of its global headquarters team, are part of an "Enterprise Acceleration Office" initiative to simplify operations and speed up growth. Incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke stated the cuts are a "necessary step" to address complexity that has hindered decisions. This move comes as Target battles declining store traffic, inventory issues, and customer backlash, with its stock falling significantly and sales expected to decline this year, diverging sharply from competitors like Walmart.</p>

          <p>A migrant who returned to the UK on a small boat after being removed to France under a "one in one out" scheme will have his removal "fast-tracked," according to the prime minister. The man, an Iranian national, claimed to have been a victim of sexual assault at the hands of smuggling gangs in France, prompting his return to the UK. He was initially removed in September as part of a treaty where France takes back migrants and the UK accepts a refugee with a protection case. This case highlights the complexities and challenges of immigration enforcement, as the UK aims to deter illegal crossings and manage increasing numbers of arrivals.</p>

          <p>Oil prices surged more than 5% after the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine" as the reason for the sanctions, which aim to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund the conflict. A White House official linked the sanctions to the cancellation of a meeting between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. This move also aligns with US efforts to pressure India to reduce its purchases of Russian oil, impacting global energy markets and raising concerns about economic growth due to trade tensions.</p>

Prosecutors emphasized that voter fraud is generally rare and detectable due to the nation’s election safeguards, which require voter signatures on ballots. Davis, a Republican, has previous convictions for forgery and other offenses. Her sentencing is scheduled for January 9, where she could face probation or up to three years in prison.

Despite substantial transfer investments of over £30m, the team's performance has declined, with players appearing to lack self-belief and nerve.

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced its largest single-day decline in over a decade, falling 6% to $4,131.47 per ounce, prompting questions about investment opportunities. This article examines whether purchasing gold from retailers like Costco is worthwhile during this dip. While gold price dips are typically temporary, Costco offers a convenient and potentially trustworthy path for shoppers to acquire physical bullion. Investing in gold now could position buyers for future gains if prices rebound towards the $5,000 mark. However, gold sales from Costco are final, and dedicated gold investing companies may offer broader options and tailored strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Lebanon, stoking fears of renewed conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, nearly a year after a tenuous ceasefire agreement. Recent Israeli attacks, including strikes on an alleged Hezbollah training camp and the killing of a commander, have led to a rising death toll, with over 274 fatalities since the ceasefire. Both sides accuse each other of violating the deal, which stipulated Israeli troop withdrawal and Hezbollah disarmament. The ongoing political vacuum and economic crisis in Lebanon exacerbate the instability, with experts warning that the stalemate could lead to a full-scale conflict, potentially serving as a model for other regional conflicts.</p>
