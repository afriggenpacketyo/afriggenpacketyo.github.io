          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple detained by ICE, strongly criticizing the government's attempt to deport them based on alleged gang affiliation. The judge, a Clinton appointee, stated the government provided no meaningful evidence to support their claims. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested multiple times based on these allegations. The judge also barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without proper notice, emphasizing the drastic consequences of such designations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The area burned by wildfires in the UK this year has already exceeded the annual record, with over 29,200 hectares affected, according to satellite data. A prolonged dry spell in March and early April created ideal conditions for widespread burning, primarily affecting grass, heath, and shrubland. While wildfires are common in the UK during early spring, the severity this year has strained fire services, though ecological impacts can be complex, with some plants adapted to fire. Scientists anticipate an increase in extreme wildfire conditions due to climate change, raising concerns about a potentially catastrophic summer fire season.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term as US president has been marked by significant disruptions to global trade, including tariff increases on goods from both rivals and allies. After initially imposing tariffs, Trump announced a temporary pause for most countries, excluding China, while calling for bilateral negotiations to address the US trade deficit. The continued trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have unsettled investors and undermined confidence in the US's ability to manage the global economy. The future of these trade policies and their impact on global markets remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate that Americans, including some Republicans, are losing faith in Donald Trump's leadership across various key issues. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term as "scary," with poor ratings on the economy and immigration policy. Only a minority of Americans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities. The polls suggest growing fatigue with Trump's policies, including trade tariffs and immigration measures, and a decline in his approval ratings among independent voters and younger generations.</p>
