          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned Hong Kong virologist who discovered the SARS coronavirus, has issued a stark warning that the next global pandemic is inevitable. He expresses concern that the world may not be significantly better prepared than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. Peiris emphasizes the high risk of new viruses, particularly respiratory ones, jumping from animals to humans, a phenomenon that has increased in frequency in recent decades. To prevent future catastrophic events that impact health, economies, and social well-being, he advocates for a more resilient global system that integrates human, animal, and environmental health.</p>

They claim their weeks-long protest was a victory, having successfully killed the special session and raised national awareness about what they describe as a "racist map." While Governor Greg Abbott has called another session where the Republican majority is expected to approve the new voting maps, Democrats state they are prepared to challenge the gerrymandering in court. The political maneuver is part of a larger national battle, with Democrat-led states planning their own redistricting efforts to counter potential Republican gains.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges related to the death of actor Matthew Perry. Her plea includes one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death, making her the last of five individuals charged in the case to do so. Perry died in October 2023 from an overdose, and prosecutors state Sangha supplied the fatal dose through intermediaries. Sangha, who faces decades in prison, also admitted in her plea agreement to selling ketamine connected to another overdose death in 2019 and running a drug-involved premises from her home.</p>

          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, top European leaders pressed President Donald Trump to demand a ceasefire from Russia before any peace negotiations with Ukraine can advance. The summit, which included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, was convened following Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, which did not secure an immediate halt to the fighting. Leaders from Germany and France explicitly stated they could not envision further talks without a ceasefire, urging Trump to "put pressure on Russia." While Trump expressed a preference for stopping the killing, he suggested a ceasefire was not strictly necessary to broker a deal, placing the onus on direct talks between Zelensky and Putin.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., the veteran Hollywood stuntman best known for being set on fire for the iconic cover of Pink Floyd's 1975 album "Wish You Were Here," has passed away at the age of 88. His long and storied career included stunt work in numerous films such as "Blazing Saddles," "Lethal Weapon," and "Thelma & Louise." For the famous album cover, which represented a music industry deal, Rondell was set ablaze fifteen times, a particularly dangerous stunt as it required him to remain stationary. He founded the stunt company Stunts Unlimited in 1970 and is survived by his wife, a son, and three grandchildren.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department, challenging a new rule that links federal grants for crime victims to immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funds for services like crisis centers and shelters, or complying with unlawful conditions that co-opt local officials into federal immigration enforcement. The states, mostly Democrat-led, contend the condition violates the original intent of the Reagan-era law that established the grant program. They are seeking an injunction to block the rule, which they argue undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

The union's president, Mark Hancock, stated that members are willing to face penalties, including fines and jail time, rather than comply with the back-to-work order. The dispute centers on demands for higher wages and pay for on-the-ground work, with the union rejecting the airline's latest compensation offer as insufficient.</p>

The author posits that diplomatic buildings are potent symbols of national power and ambition, and China's plan signals its view of London as a critical global capital and a metaphor for its rise as a superpower. This long-term strategic investment is contrasted with the UK's recent sales of prime diplomatic properties for short-term financial gain. Despite some political and security concerns, the article suggests the project could ultimately benefit Britain by reinforcing London's global importance.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is projected to move up the U.S. East Coast without making landfall, but will likely generate life-threatening surf and rip currents. As of Monday, Erin was a powerful Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds, and it is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane through mid-week. While the storm's center will pass between Bermuda and the U.S., its large size will impact coastal areas from the Bahamas to North Carolina. Officials have issued tropical storm watches and storm surge warnings for the Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations have been ordered for some islands due to flooding risks.</p>

The author points to bizarre applications, such as an AI-reanimated version of a school shooting victim, and the breathless rhetoric from Silicon Valley that promises a world-altering future while ignoring the immediate, often negative, consequences. The piece argues this has created widespread disorientation, from job loss anxiety to vulnerable users forming unhealthy attachments to chatbots.

The study highlights that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others. In contrast, sectors that saw high demand post-pandemic, such as leisure, hospitality, and healthcare, have seen wage growth that outpaced inflation, reflecting shifting power dynamics in the labor market.

As unsecured debts, BNPL balances can technically be included in debt forgiveness programs, similar to credit card debt. However, eligibility and success can vary, as BNPL is a newer form of credit and not all providers may be willing to negotiate settlements.

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's recent vows to issue an executive order changing how U.S. elections are run, constitutional law provides the president with little to no direct authority over their administration. The U.S. Constitution grants states the power to determine the "time, place and manner" of elections, while allowing Congress to alter rules for federal elections. The president is not mentioned as having a role in this process, a principle that courts have previously upheld by blocking parts of Trump's earlier election-related executive orders.

          <p>Starlink, the satellite internet service operated by SpaceX, suffered a brief but widespread network outage on Monday, with thousands of users reporting service interruptions. This marks the second significant outage for the service in the past two weeks.

The recent instability comes as SpaceX continues to rapidly expand its satellite constellation, with another successful launch conducted on the same day as the outage from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.</p>

The impending shortage threatens the daily lives of Iranians and highlights the severe environmental and administrative challenges the nation is currently confronting.</p>

In the private remarks, broadcast by Israeli's Channel 12, Haliva suggested that for every Israeli killed on October 7, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children, as a "message" for the future. Haliva, who resigned over the intelligence failures leading to the Hamas attack, confirmed the authenticity of the remarks but said they were taken out of context.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could initially overstate profitability as new tariffs on imported goods take effect. RIM uses an average cost-to-retail price ratio across product groups, which is less responsive to sudden cost increases compared to cost accounting, where each item's actual cost is tracked. This can create a temporary disconnect where a company's financial reports do not immediately reflect the full impact of the tariffs on their bottom line. The distortion would likely normalize over several quarters as the new cost structures are fully absorbed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law, overstays, and other concerns. According to the department, the majority of the revocations were for criminal offenses such as assault and burglary, while about 200 to 300 were related to "support for terrorism." The action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and follows enhanced social media screening for visa applicants. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have raised concerns that the policy is an attack on due process and targets students for their political expression, particularly those protesting in support of Palestine.</p>

The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to propose a new ending where Juliet does not die but instead embarks on a journey of self-discovery in Paris. This updated narrative is powered by a catalog of hit songs from producer Max Martin, including anthems made famous by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The review praises the show's clever book, vibrant direction, and energetic choreography, calling it a feel-good dance party that successfully blends 21st-century female empowerment with a classic story.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. The article explains that these limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy are key factors in pricing the guaranteed income products. The best age to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for potential growth in deferred annuities, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement can complement Social Security and provide a stable income stream.</p>

          <p>The recently discovered interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is generating new speculation from Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, who has previously suggested such objects could be extraterrestrial artifacts. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope show a glow of light ahead of the object but no corresponding cometary tail, leading Loeb to question if it is producing its own light. He proposes two possibilities: it is a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova, or it is a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy. While acknowledging the need for better evidence, Loeb has successfully encouraged NASA to use its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe the object when it passes nearby this fall.</p>
