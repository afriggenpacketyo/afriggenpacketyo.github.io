          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles, U.S. officials stated that the National Guard and Marines are deployed to protect federal buildings and personnel, operating under specific rules of force. These troops are not to engage crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, though they will carry ammunition for self-defense. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. The Los Angeles Police Department chief expressed concern about the lack of coordination, while a retired Air Force general questioned the use of military personnel alongside law enforcement. The article highlights the complexities of military deployment in civilian contexts. Optimism score must be based on a general scale of stability versus panic, panic being towards 0 and stability being towards 100.</p>

          <p>President Trump authorized deploying 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Newsom criticized the deployment as a move to stroke the President's ego and accused the troops of lacking food and water. The ACLU condemned the mobilization of the Marines, questioning their training for policing protests while respecting constitutional rights. Trump also suggested arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions, escalating the conflict between the federal government and California.

          <p>The girlfriend of Derrick Groves, an inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail, was arrested for allegedly assisting in his escape. Darriana Burton, a former correctional employee, is accused of relaying escape-related information and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail. Authorities say Burton had an active involvement in the planning phase of the escape, including a FaceTime call where she displayed an unknown man who advised against the escape.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned President Trump's suggestion that he should be arrested, labeling it as "acts of a dictator." This escalation follows Trump's deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles over Newsom's objections to handle protests related to immigration enforcement. Trump justified his actions by citing Newsom's poor performance as governor, while House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed solidarity with the President. Newsom has announced that the state is suing the administration over the deployment of the National Guard, citing it as an illegal and authoritarian move.

          <p>A UK parliamentary report criticizes the country's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" and says it perpetuates outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more of average earnings and extending paternity leave to six weeks. Currently, eligible fathers receive £187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower, which is less than 50% of the National Living Wage. The report also highlights the underutilization and complexity of shared parental leave, and the findings have been released on the eve of a dad strike advocating for parental leave policy changes. The article discusses the need for significant investment and reform in the UK's parental leave policies.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks. Teachers are advised to be transparent about their use of AI and always check its results, with the technology being used for low-stakes marking. The Department for Education says AI should only be used for low-stakes marking such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its results. Experts emphasize the importance of teachers learning to use AI to support students effectively, while also warning about potential data breaches and errors.

          <p>This article examines the legal questions surrounding President Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to protests. Trump has long considered using the military to suppress protests, especially in cities governed by Democrats. The legality of deploying federal troops on U.S. soil is complex, primarily due to the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The article analyzes the legal justifications and limitations of Trump's actions.</p>
