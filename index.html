          <h2>Bank of England Grapples with Tariff Impact and UK Growth Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey highlights the potential growth shock to the UK economy from proposed US tariffs amidst weak domestic growth. Bailey stated that the central bank is carefully considering the impact of tariffs on both growth and inflation, particularly how trade redirection and potential UK retaliation could affect prices. He acknowledged the UK's current economic uncertainty, which is weighing on business and consumer confidence, but downplayed the immediate risk of a recession. The central bank is balancing weak growth with the potential for tariffs to exacerbate supply-side issues, further complicating monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv that resulted in at least 12 deaths and 90 injuries, President Trump issued a rare public call for Putin to "STOP!" The assault, which was the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since last summer, prompted widespread condemnation and renewed concerns about escalating conflict. Trump's statement comes amidst ongoing negotiations to end the war, with the White House reportedly pressuring Zelenskyy to consider a peace plan that may involve ceding territory to Russia. This directive marks a notable shift in Trump's rhetoric, who has previously been criticized for his perceived leniency towards Russia. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cut federal funding from sanctuary cities, citing similar reasons to a 2017 ruling against a nearly identical policy. Judge William Orrick stated that the policy is likely unlawful and unconstitutional, as it infringes upon the rights of cities and counties to limit local resource use in enforcing federal immigration law. The challenge was brought by 16 cities and counties, who argued that the funding freeze would cause irreparable harm through budgetary uncertainty and undermining community trust. This ruling marks another legal setback for the administration's efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski believes NFL Draft prospect Travis Hunter is uniquely equipped to play both offense and defense at the professional level. Stefanski cited Hunter's strong work ethic and ability to maximize his time, referencing his early morning fishing habits. While other coaches have expressed concerns about the feasibility of a two-way player in the NFL, Stefanski's comments suggest the Browns are seriously considering drafting Hunter with the No. 2 overall pick. Hunter has stated he would rather quit football than be confined to a single position, highlighting his passion for playing on both sides of the ball.</p>

Representative Gerry Connolly expressed alarm that the CDC has placed the 22 staffers who handle Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests on administrative leave. The move has effectively halted the processing of public records requests, raising concerns about the administration's commitment to transparency. HHS Secretary Robert F.

Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, indicated that the economic impact of tariffs would take time to manifest, suggesting the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates immediately.

The article highlights the importance of avoiding excessive student debt, which can negatively impact psychological well-being, and suggests finding a balance between personal interests and practical career prospects when choosing a field of study.
