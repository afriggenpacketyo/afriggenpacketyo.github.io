          <p>Poland reported an unprecedented violation of its airspace by at least 19 Russian drones, prompting the scrambling of Polish and allied fighter jets which shot down several of the aircraft. This marked the first instance of NATO forces engaging Russian drones over allied territory, escalating tensions amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. In response, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the invocation of NATO's Article 4 to consult with allies on the threat. The incident drew widespread condemnation from European leaders, who affirmed their solidarity with Poland against what they termed a reckless act of aggression.</p>

          <p>Nepal's army is patrolling the streets of Kathmandu following days of intense unrest that led to over 20 deaths, the torching of parliament, and the prime minister's resignation. The protests, initially led by "Gen Z" activists against corruption and nepotism, spiraled into widespread violence and arson. The youth groups have since distanced themselves from the destruction, claiming their peaceful movement was hijacked by opportunistic elements. As a nationwide curfew is enforced, the military has invited protest leaders to peace talks, while the nation faces a significant leadership vacuum and an uncertain political future.</p>

          <p>A new National Transportation Safety Board report details a July incident where a Delta flight encountered severe turbulence over Wyoming, violently throwing unbuckled passengers and crew into the cabin ceiling. The flight, bound for Amsterdam from Salt Lake City, experienced 2.5 minutes of turbulence within a thunderstorm, resulting in 18 hospitalizations. The report notes that passengers felt a gravitational force up to 1.75 times their body weight while the seatbelt sign was off. The investigation will examine the pilots' decisions to alter their route and turn off the seatbelt sign before entering the storm.</p>

While his arrival was met with some cheers, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters confronted him inside the restaurant, chanting slogans before being removed by the Secret Service. Trump claimed his crackdown has made the city safe and that restaurants are now booming, a statement made amid reports of some businesses seeing a drop in reservations. The rare public outing also included Vice President JD Vance and other high-level administration officials.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly agreed with Vice President JD Vance's assertion that a small group of individuals is responsible for the vast majority of violent crime and should be imprisoned. Vance criticized the Democratic perspective that crime is 'systemic,' arguing this view deflects individual responsibility and leads to ineffective nonprofit funding. Musk shared Vance's post on X, adding that having more sympathy for likely murderers than their potential victims is 'disgusting.' The exchange highlights a growing conservative critique of progressive approaches to criminal justice, with both figures advocating for stricter incarceration policies for repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has stated he anticipates the release of more 'embarrassing' communications between himself and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This follows the publication of a 20-year-old letter in which Mandelson referred to Epstein as his 'best pal.' Expressing 'profound regret' for the association, Mandelson said he was deceived by the financier and felt deep sympathy for his victims. Despite the controversy, Downing Street has affirmed its confidence in the ambassador, highlighting his importance in strengthening UK-US trade relations, particularly with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has cautioned that a U.S. proposal to shorten visas for Chinese journalists could trigger a new round of 'media warfare' between the two nations. The Department of Homeland Security has proposed capping the stay for mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days, a significant reduction from the previous policy tied to their employment duration. An embassy spokesperson labeled the proposed policy a 'discriminatory step' and urged the U.S. to reconsider the move. This development is part of a broader pattern of escalating tensions and retaliatory measures affecting journalists in both countries.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has characterized President Trump's threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as a political power grab rather than a genuine effort to combat crime. Pritzker alleges that Trump's goal is to 'normalize' the use of military forces in civilian areas to create a pretext for potential intervention in the 2026 congressional elections. While Trump has cited crime statistics, Pritzker argues the move is an unconstitutional overreach, especially as the administration has already initiated a federal immigration enforcement operation in the city. The governor's stance highlights the escalating conflict between state and federal authorities over domestic policy.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of originalism, the judicial philosophy championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, arguing it has fundamentally altered American law. It posits that as political polarization made amending the Constitution nearly impossible, conservatives successfully shifted their strategy to reshaping the judiciary with judges who interpret the document based on its perceived original meaning. This movement has been central to landmark legal battles over abortion and gun rights, effectively halting constitutional evolution through amendment and concentrating immense power within the Supreme Court. The article suggests this has led to a rigid, 'dead' interpretation of the Constitution, fueling political division.</p>

These incidents are recorded when an act is perceived as motivated by prejudice but does not meet the threshold of a criminal offense.

The judge, Jia Cobb, stated that the 'for cause' provision for removing a governor likely pertains only to conduct during their time in office, not prior actions. Trump sought to remove Cook based on allegations of mortgage fraud that predated her appointment to the Fed board.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks to remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. This would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap, and reflects the declining use of PINs. While the move could streamline larger purchases like a full grocery shop, it has raised concerns about fraud. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for any fraudulent transactions and would need to ensure their systems can identify low-risk payments, while also giving customers the option to set their own limits.</p>

          <p>New research tracking American grocery receipts has found that people tend to consume more sugar during hot weather, primarily through an increase in the purchase of sugary beverages like sodas and energy drinks. The study, published in Nature Climate Change, discovered that sugar consumption rose slightly with each degree Celsius of warming. This behavioral link suggests that as global temperatures rise due to climate change, overall sugar intake could also increase, potentially exacerbating public health issues like diabetes and heart disease. The findings highlight the need for public health policies that promote access to clean water as an alternative.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 30-day emergency authority over Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department is scheduled to expire, with Congress showing no indication of granting an extension. Trump invoked the Home Rule Act in August to federalize the local police in a declared 'crime emergency,' a move that has been controversial. While D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has credited the federal intervention with a drop in crime, she has also stated that the city does not need a presidential emergency and has a framework for cooperation. The expiration shifts the focus to Congress, where Republicans are proposing bills to exert more long-term control over D.C.'s criminal justice system.</p>

The company lowered its full-year operating profit growth forecast due to a one-off cost of $1.26 billion associated with the layoffs, signaling a strategic shift to maintain its market leadership in diabetes and obesity treatments.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request for an expedited hearing on the legality of many of the president's tariffs. The case consolidates two lower court rulings that found Trump had overstepped his authority by imposing wide-ranging 'reciprocal tariffs' and other duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration argued for a swift review, warning that a delayed decision could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs. The court will hear oral arguments in November, signaling a potentially rapid resolution to the major legal challenge against the president's trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end its war in Ukraine by targeting the Kremlin's key revenue streams. The proposal was made during a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, where Washington indicated it was prepared to mirror any tariffs Europe imposes. This aggressive trade tactic risks escalating global trade tensions, particularly with India, which has already been hit with U.S. tariffs over its energy relationship with Russia.</p>

With Europe drastically reducing its reliance on Russian gas, the Kremlin has lost significant leverage and is now more dependent on China as a primary customer. This shift in the energy landscape allows China to dictate more favorable terms, redefining the economic and geopolitical dynamics of the Russia-China partnership.</p>
