          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from Qatar, intended for potential use as the new Air Force One, raising concerns about security and improper influence. The article reports that the plane, valued at around $200 million, will require extensive modifications to meet security standards, including missile defense systems and protection against electromagnetic pulses. Members of Congress worry that President Trump may pressure the Air Force to expedite the work, potentially compromising security. Qatar's prime minister rejected accusations of bribery, asserting the gift is a gesture of respect and partnership between the two countries, as the plane is meant to replace the current aging Air Force One planes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar, intending to use it as the new Air Force One, though the project is years behind schedule.

The article states that the administration deported eight immigrants after telling them they were being sent to South Sudan, giving them little more than 24 hours' notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, described the timeframe as "plainly insufficient" and suggested the administration's actions could result in criminal contempt. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, where U.S. military personnel are standing by to assist with securing the detainees.</p>

It recounts the experiences of farmers in South Texas who were forced to give up their land for the wall, illustrating how Trump has been quick to embrace government-sanctioned land grabs despite railing against similar actions overseas.

The bill includes tax cuts, increased defense and border security spending, and healthcare program cuts. Hard-line Republicans want deeper spending cuts, while others want deeper tax cuts, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3tn to the national debt. Trump visited Congress to urge Republicans to accept the bill, but it is unclear if he swayed many votes.

Experts note that the policy primarily benefits moderate to middle-income workers, as lower-income tipped workers often don't pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction.

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The article states that the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5 percent, reflecting deficit worries, and the 30-year yield has jumped above 5 percent, its highest in about a year and a half. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta warned that volatility in the Treasury market could add to economic uncertainty. Analysts suggest that a much larger spike in yields would be needed to impose discipline on Washington decision makers.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin jumped to a new all-time high, surpassing its prior record from January, reaching as high as $109,500.

Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin surpassed $40 billion, and on-chain data shows lower selling pressure.

The number of students experiencing homelessness increased by more than 9%. Decreasing enrollment is challenging school systems because it means they receive less revenue without a corresponding decrease in overhead and staffing costs.</p>

One resident says her pension gets less every year and that regulators should step in to keep prices down.
