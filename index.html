          <p>Supported housing, which aids vulnerable individuals in independent living, is facing a crisis due to funding cuts and rising costs, according to an open letter signed by over 170 organizations. Services are shutting down, leading to a shortfall of about 325,000 places, with more closures feared without increased government funding. The organizations are requesting long-term funding of at least £1.6 billion per year for councils and for supported homes to be included in the government's housing plans. Jason Liu's family shared that supported housing has improved his son Jason's life, who has autism, a learning disability, and mental health challenges.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Ward becomes the third consecutive quarterback to be selected first overall, highlighting the importance of the position in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, while other notable picks included Abdul Carter to the Giants and Will Campbell to the Patriots. This year's draft was anticipated to be unpredictable due to a lack of clear top prospects, unlike the talent-rich class of 2024.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order to advance seabed mining in international waters, a move opposed by most nations. The order circumvents a decades-old treaty and instructs NOAA to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. waters. This decision is likely to provoke criticism from both allies and rivals and reflects the Trump administration's disregard for international institutions.</p>
