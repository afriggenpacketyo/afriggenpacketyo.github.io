          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is supported by increasing institutional investment and anticipation of a clearer regulatory framework, as the U.S. Congress is set to deliberate on new crypto-related legislation. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the coming months, despite potential short-term volatility from international trade disputes.

          <p>China's exports in June grew by 5.8% year-over-year, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. This growth occurred despite a continued, albeit slowing, decline in shipments to the United States, which was partially offset by a temporary tariff truce. While imports also saw their first increase of the year, the overall data highlights Chinese exporters' successful diversification efforts amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have risen to their highest level in six years, with 3,691 people prosecuted in the 2024-25 period. Transport for London (TfL) also issued over 13,000 penalty notices on the Tube, while the London Overground saw a record number of penalties issued. TfL stated that it is committed to reducing fare evasion, which it describes as a crime that 'robs Londoners of vital investment,' and has expanded its enforcement teams to target offenders.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken sequence of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland. The tradition continues today with a human observer manually recording temperature and other data, providing an invaluable, long-term record that documents the region's changing climate and has contributed to the science of meteorology.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following an announcement that the U.S. plans to send more Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. The strategy involves the U.S. selling weapons to European NATO allies, who can then transfer their existing, U.S.-made systems to Kyiv more quickly. The discussions come as bipartisan pressure grows in Congress for sanctions to cripple Russia's economy, with a proposed bill that would give the president authority to impose massive tariffs on countries aiding Russia's war effort.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europe's liberty faces its greatest threat since World War II and has called for a significant increase in France's defense budget. In a speech to the armed forces, he proposed doubling the military budget to €64 billion by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, citing complex geopolitics and 'imperialist policies' from powers like Russia. The plan, which requires government approval, aims to bolster France's power and ensure its freedom in an increasingly unstable world.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, long admired by some international conservatives for his 'illiberal democracy' model, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new opposition party, led by a former insider, is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the poor state of public services and corruption, with some polls showing it ahead of Orban's Fidesz party. This internal pressure is mounting even as Orban continues to employ his familiar playbook of targeting cultural issues to rally his base.</p>
