          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, the last known living American hostage in Gaza, signaling a potential step towards a ceasefire with Israel. The release follows direct talks between Hamas and US officials in Doha, with Hamas expressing readiness for intensive negotiations to achieve a long-term truce, including prisoner exchanges and humanitarian aid. US President Donald Trump hailed the release as a 'monumental' step, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that negotiations would continue 'under fire'. The release comes after a broken ceasefire in March and amidst escalating conflict that has resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with the hope of this release being the first step towards de-escalation.</p>

This decision aligns with the HHS and FDA's move to ban petroleum-based synthetic dyes due to health concerns, with FDA Commissioner Martin Makary emphasizing the agency's commitment to transitioning to natural alternatives. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. noted that the food industry is actively collaborating with federal agencies in this shift, while industry experts like Vani Hari and Courtney Swan lauded the change, highlighting the health risks associated with synthetic dyes and the availability of safer, plant-based alternatives.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revive a policy aimed at lowering drug costs by tying them to prices in other developed countries. The 'most favored nation' policy seeks to ensure the US pays the lowest price available worldwide for certain medications, impacting both commercial and government markets like Medicare and Medicaid. The administration intends to focus on drugs with significant price disparities, potentially including popular weight loss and diabetes treatments. The order directs agencies to crack down on foreign policies that suppress drug prices and establish a pathway for US patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the most favored nation prices.</p>

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that individuals taking tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, experienced greater weight loss compared to those taking semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Tirzepatide users lost approximately 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost around 14% over a 72-week period. Dr. CÃ©line Gounder noted the study was funded by Lilly, the maker of tirzepatide, but added that the research appears legitimate and aligns with previous findings. Beyond weight loss, these drugs offer additional health benefits, including improved blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. The high cost and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers to access.</p>

          <p>Credit counseling can provide expert guidance and strategies for managing debt, but it's important to understand the associated costs. Most non-profit agencies offer free initial consultations, but fees may apply for services like debt management plans, including setup fees and monthly maintenance fees. While these fees can add up, they are generally more affordable than the interest on high-balance credit cards or the fees charged by other debt relief options. Credit counseling can also help improve credit scores by establishing consistent, on-time payments, making it a smart way to manage debt. (not investment advice)</p>

The middle class is increasingly unattainable for younger generations, requiring six-figure incomes to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. Rising costs in housing, healthcare, and insurance, coupled with greater responsibility for retirement funding, contribute to this financial strain. Experts argue that the problem is structural, not behavioral, making it harder for young people to achieve traditional markers of success, leading to adaptations like living with parents longer and sharing childcare.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its plans to reduce immigration into the UK through a series of measures including tightening work visa requirements, increasing residency waits, and scrapping the care worker visa. The proposed changes aim to create a 'controlled, selective, and fair' system, but the government has not set a specific target for net migration. Key measures include raising qualification requirements for skilled worker visas, expanding eligibility for elite university graduates, doubling the residency wait for indefinite leave to remain, and implementing stricter rules for international students. The plans also involve tougher English tests and a review of family rights in immigration cases.</p>
