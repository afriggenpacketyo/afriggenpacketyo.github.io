          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:43:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A multi-story residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has resulted in at least 16 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for a second day. Officials confirmed that ten bodies were recovered overnight, adding to the six found initially. Rescue efforts are complicated by the building's location on a narrow street, which hinders the use of heavy machinery, as workers search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, often attributed to poor construction standards and the use of substandard materials to reduce costs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN analyst Carolyn Peck has drawn significant criticism for suggesting the Indiana Fever are a "more dangerous" team without their injured superstar, Caitlin Clark. Peck argued that Clark's ball-dominant style is predictable, whereas her absence allows other players like Kelsey Mitchell and Aliyah Boston to showcase their talents. The comments sparked outrage among Clark's supporters on social media, with many pointing to team statistics that show a lower offensive rating without her on the court. This incident is the latest example of the intense media scrutiny and debate surrounding Clark's impact in the WNBA.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:38:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital details the severe challenges that impoverished and disabled patients face, which will be exacerbated by new Medicaid work requirements. The article uses the story of a man who became homeless and disabled to illustrate how bureaucratic hurdles, like needing a fixed address or internet access, can prevent eligible individuals from receiving care. The author argues that these requirements are designed to cut costs by disenfranchising the most vulnerable, projecting that nearly 12 million Americans could lose insurance. This will strain safety-net hospitals and ultimately harm patients nationwide.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for the Reform UK party, has had the party whip removed pending an investigation into allegations concerning his business conduct. The party's chief whip stated that the claims, published by the Sunday Times, relate to business propriety during the pandemic, before McMurdock was elected. McMurdock has agreed to cooperate with the investigation and now sits as an independent, reducing Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four. He is the second Reform MP elected in 2024 to lose the party whip, following Rupert Lowe's suspension in March.</p>

          <h2>Happiness Researcher Proposes '90-Second Rule' for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A happiness researcher, Mo Gawdat, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged feeling of upset is a conscious or unconscious choice to rerun the thought, thus renewing the hormonal cycle. Gawdat, who began his research after the tragic death of his son, advises using this 90-second buffer to consciously shift focus, ask practical questions about the situation, and choose a more constructive response rather than ruminating.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish emphasis on hobbies for a happy life, a business school professor embarked on a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from pottery to rock climbing. The author found that engaging in hobbies helped her kick a doomscrolling habit, reduce stress, and feel less lonely by connecting with new communities. She argues that hobbies are not a luxury to be pursued after achieving work-life balance, but rather the key to creating that balance in the first place. The experience fundamentally changed her perspective on self-care, helping her become more confident and model a healthier lifestyle for her children.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex-trafficking trial demonstrates the legal system's inadequacy in handling cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was convicted on lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts shows how difficult it is to prosecute complex abuse dynamics under existing laws. The author notes that prosecutors often turn to trafficking charges due to longer statutes of limitations and more severe penalties, as domestic violence laws are often ill-equipped to address the nuances of power and control. The article criticizes the media's framing and public reaction, suggesting a societal tendency to minimize the severity of such abuse.</p>

          <p>This article explores the evolving motivations for exercise, moving beyond the traditional goal of weight loss to embrace a wider range of physical and mental health benefits. It suggests that many people need to rewire their brains, which often associate working out with diet culture, by finding new forms of movement and community. For some, this means discovering the empowerment of weight lifting, while for others it might be running or group fitness classes. By reframing exercise as a source of strength, comfort, and joy, individuals can develop a more sustainable and positive relationship with their bodies and physical activity.</p>

After the coalition successfully challenged and overturned the permit, state legislators passed a bill, now signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, that permanently bans oil and gas exploration within 10 miles of the area's sensitive estuaries, securing a major victory for environmental preservation.</p>

          <p>Amid a consumer spending pullback, fast-casual restaurant chains like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Cava are intensifying their focus on loyalty programs to drive repeat business. With overall restaurant traffic declining, these rewards programs have become essential for building customer habits beyond occasional discounts. Data shows that loyalty members visit restaurants more frequently and spend more, making them a critical segment for brands facing sales pressure. Companies are revamping their programs to offer more value and flexibility, hoping that the cost of freebies will be offset by long-term customer engagement and full-price purchases.</p>

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells' novella, offers a refreshing take on artificial intelligence by featuring a protagonist that has no desire to be human. The show follows a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas. Unlike many sci-fi narratives where AI yearns for human connection or seeks to dominate, this character, which names itself "Murderbot," finds humans messy and uninteresting, preferring to be treated as a machine. This quirky premise subverts genre expectations and explores the idea that a true AI's desires might be entirely alien to our own.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural and commercial power of the British monarchy's Royal Warrants, the official seal of approval granted to goods and services. As the Prince and Princess of Wales prepare to grant their own warrants, the article notes the wide range of approved suppliers, from luxury car brands to chimney sweeps. This royal endorsement serves as a potent marketing tool, conveying quality and class, particularly to American consumers. The author humorously connects this influence to a recent poll where a surprising number of young Americans expressed a preference for being ruled by the British monarch over the U.S. President.</p>

Raducanu is not the only player to question the technology's accuracy and the quietness of the automated calls, which can be drowned out by the crowd. The All England Club's chair defended the system, stating it was implemented in response to player demand for more accuracy than human line judges could provide.</p>

          <p>Reverend William Barber's revived Poor People's Campaign is using a strategy of nonviolent moral protest to challenge policies it deems harmful to the poor and vulnerable. Drawing on a tradition of prophetic witness, the movement organizes diverse "fusion" coalitions to stage demonstrations, such as the recent "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C. against proposed budget cuts. Barber argues that such policies amount to "policy murder" and that a moral reckoning is needed to address the nation's deep-seated inequality. The movement aims to build pressure on lawmakers by framing political issues as profound moral crises, continuing a legacy of faith-based activism in the public square.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could combat tumors by strengthening a key group of anti-tumor immune cells known as dendritic cells. These cells, which act as the immune system's intelligence agents, often become depleted or impaired as cancer progresses. According to the researchers, sildenafil appears to reverse this process and restore the cells' function, potentially opening the door to a new form of tumor immunotherapy strategy.</p>
