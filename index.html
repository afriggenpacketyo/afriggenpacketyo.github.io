          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another was injured in a deadly ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after responding to a reported brush fire. The Kootenai County Sheriff described the attack as a "total ambush," stating the firefighters had no chance. Following an extensive manhunt involving around 300 law enforcement officers, the suspected gunman was found deceased on Canfield Mountain with a firearm nearby. Authorities are investigating the possibility that the fire was deliberately set as a lure to attract the first responders to the location.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing for a marathon voting session on a major legislative package proposed by the Trump administration. The bill, which has already passed the House, includes significant spending increases for border security, defense, and energy, offset by cuts to social programs like healthcare and nutrition. The Congressional Budget Office projects it will increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. Democrats are expected to use the extended voting process, known as a "vote-a-rama," to force Republicans into difficult positions on controversial amendments ahead of the midterm elections.

          <p>An intense heatwave is gripping Southern and Eastern Europe, prompting France to issue an "unprecedented" number of high-level heat alerts across most of its mainland regions. Record-breaking temperatures have been recorded in Spain and Portugal, leading to widespread disruptions including school closures, forest fires, and increased strain on emergency medical services. The severe weather, which is also affecting Italy, Germany, the UK, and the Balkans, is expected to peak mid-week. Experts note that while linking single events to climate change is complex, such extreme heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has initiated the process of withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, an international treaty that prohibits the use, production, and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree to this effect, citing Russia's extensive and cynical use of such weapons, as Moscow never joined the accord. The decision, which now requires parliamentary approval, comes as Ukraine continues to deal with regions littered with Russian mines. This move coincides with one of the largest Russian aerial attacks of the war, involving hundreds of drones and missiles.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, American security agencies have issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Tehran-backed "sleeper cells" within the United States. This article examines the credibility of this threat, balancing the reality of Iran's history of sponsoring foreign operations against the possibility that the danger is being sensationalized for political purposes. Experts suggest that while Iran likely maintains clandestine cells for intelligence and potential strikes, a direct attack on U.S. soil remains a contingency for moments of existential desperation, not a current strategic goal. The piece highlights the difficulty in separating genuine national security concerns from political rhetoric.</p>

          <p>The fast-food chain Raising Cane's has surpassed KFC to become the third-largest chicken chain in the U.S. by annual sales, trailing only Chick-fil-A and Popeyes.

With rapid expansion and high average unit volumes, the chain has more than doubled its sales since 2021.

          <p>Moderna has reported positive results from a late-stage trial of its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine, showing it produced a stronger immune response than a currently available flu shot. The successful trial clears a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone vaccine and its combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to resubmit its application for the combination vaccine later this year, which could simplify vaccination and improve uptake. This development positions Moderna as a frontrunner in the race to bring a combination respiratory vaccine to market.</p>

The article highlights research showing that recent birth data from countries across Latin America, Europe, and Asia are falling dramatically below the UN's most pessimistic forecasts. This trend defies the standard "modernization story" where fertility stabilizes, instead showing a continuous plummet to historically low levels.

          <p>On the day the Los Angeles Sparks retired the jersey of franchise legend Candace Parker, the team suffered another disappointing loss, falling to the Chicago Sky. This opinion article frames the team's ongoing struggles as the "Candace Curse," highlighting the stark contrast between their success during Parker's tenure and their five-year playoff drought since her departure. The author argues that the organization's past "toxic culture" and mismanagement led to her leaving, and the team now lacks the superstar talent and clear direction needed to compete. The loss underscored the franchise's decline from a WNBA powerhouse to a team mired in mediocrity.</p>

While the storm is no longer a cyclone, forecasters expect its remnants to bring several inches of heavy rain to regions like San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas.

          <p>Trade negotiations between Canada and the United States are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its plan to implement a digital services tax on large technology firms. The proposed 3% tax, which would have affected major U.S. companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon, had been strongly opposed by President Trump, who had suspended talks over the issue. Following a phone call between the leaders, Canada announced it would withdraw the tax in anticipation of a broader trade deal. This move is seen as a concession to restart progress on a new economic relationship.</p>

          <p>Amid Cuba's severe economic crisis, China is quietly emerging as the nation's primary benefactor, supplanting Russia, whose recent promises of aid have largely failed to materialize. While Russian-backed projects have stalled, China is making significant, timely investments in critical infrastructure, most notably by financing dozens of solar parks to stabilize Cuba's collapsing electrical grid. This strategic support, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, is providing a crucial lifeline to the island nation, which is grappling with shortages and renewed U.S. sanctions. The shift highlights a change in geopolitical influence in the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>In this opinion article, Robert Reich argues that the data-analysis firm Palantir, co-founded by Peter Thiel, poses a significant threat to American democracy, particularly through its work with the Trump administration. Reich warns that Palantir's contract to create a massive, centralized database combining personal information from numerous federal agencies could be used to surveil and target political opponents, immigrants, and critics. He frames the company as the intersection of AI surveillance, military applications, and a Silicon Valley faction aiming to turn the U.S. toward authoritarianism.

          <p>This article argues that the modern obsession with tracking and achieving high daily step counts is transforming the simple pleasure of walking into a source of anxiety and compulsion. While walking is a healthy activity, the cultural fixation on metrics, fueled by social media influencers and fitness trackers, aligns with a broader productivity-obsessed "hustle culture." The author notes that scientific research indicates the health benefits of walking often plateau around 7,000 to 8,000 steps, well below the extreme goals many now pursue. Quantifying every step can diminish the intrinsic enjoyment of the activity, turning it into another task to be optimized.</p>

The nonprofit created a new parent company, Ascendiun Inc., in Delaware, a move that critics fear will reduce public oversight and allow the transfer of billions of dollars in assets out of state. Concerns have been raised that this could allow the insurer to use its substantial surplus, accrued under its former tax-exempt status, with fewer obligations to benefit Californians through lower rates or charitable endeavors.

The piece emphasizes fundamental safety rules: closely monitor weather forecasts, stay ashore if winds are picking up, avoid overloading vessels, and head for safety at the first sign of white caps.

In contrast, the defense has acknowledged Combs's bad behavior and drug use but argued that his actions, while reprehensible, do not meet the legal elements of the serious federal crimes charged.

          <p>A recent wave of Israeli air strikes across northern Gaza has resulted in the mass displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families and at least five reported fatalities. The bombardment targeted several densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza City, including a school sheltering displaced people, following one of the largest evacuation orders of the conflict. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as families were forced to flee for the seventh time in some cases. The attacks compound a severe humanitarian crisis and come amid growing international and domestic pressure on Israel's prime minister to pursue a ceasefire agreement.</p>
