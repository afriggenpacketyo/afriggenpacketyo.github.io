          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate from 21% to 20%, marking the first rate cut since September 2022. This decision signals a gradual easing of inflation pressures, which President Vladimir Putin had previously described as "alarming." The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank anticipates maintaining a tight monetary policy for an extended period to achieve its 4% inflation target, even as the ruble has become the world's best-performing currency this year due to capital controls and policy tightening.

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow thunderstorm warning for southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of South Wales, effective from 09:00 to 18:00 BST on Saturday. The warning indicates a good chance of heavy showers potentially leading to transport disruptions, spray-affected driving conditions, and standing water, which could result in longer journey times. There is also a likelihood of short-term power loss and potential damage to buildings from lightning strikes. While other parts of the UK will experience showers on Saturday, they are not expected to be as severe as those in the south, and the storms are expected to ease off in the west from mid-afternoon.</p>

          <p>San Antonio police are investigating whether bias played a role in the fatal shooting of Jonathan Joss, a Native American voice actor known for his work on "King of the Hill." Joss' husband alleges that the shooter used homophobic slurs before opening fire, but police initially found no evidence to support the claim. The police chief has since retracted the initial statement, confirming that bias is now part of the investigation. Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, a neighbor with whom Joss had a history of disputes, has been charged with murder and is currently free on bond, and friends and colleagues are honoring Joss's memory with tributes.</p>

Elon Musk has publicly stated his bi-weekly ketamine use for depression, prescribed by a doctor, while reports suggest he may have used it excessively during the previous year. The drug, originally synthesized in the 1960s as an anesthetic, has shown remarkable effectiveness in alleviating symptoms of depression, leading to the FDA approving a ketamine-derived nasal spray in 2019. However, the growing recreational use of ketamine outside medical supervision raises concerns about potential health consequences, including kidney and liver damage, memory loss, and paranoia.</p>

          <p>A legal battle has erupted over Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate, with his widow, Jane Buffett, seeking the removal of co-trustee Richard Mozenter. Jane alleges that Mozenter has acted against her best interests and failed to provide necessary financial information. Mozenter has filed a counter-petition in Florida to remove Jane as co-trustee and representative of the estate. The dispute centers on the marital trust set up for Jane's benefit, with claims of mismanagement and hostility.</p>

          <p>For the U.S. Men's National Team, the upcoming summer tournaments present a unique challenge in defining success beyond simply winning. With key players absent, the team aims to rehabilitate its reputation after a disappointing performance in the Concacaf Nations League. Coach Mauricio Pochettino has an opportunity to evaluate new talent and tactical alternatives. The team's focus is on improving intensity, connection with fans, and overall performance, which could compensate for a failure to win the Gold Cup.</p>

          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprising, given the region's relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery highlights the extensive farming practices of Native Americans before European colonization.</p>
