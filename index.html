          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will levy a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The announcement was made via letters to the leaders of both nations, which warned against retaliatory measures and stated the tariffs could be adjusted based on the bilateral relationship. This move, which reimposes higher rates after a temporary 90-day pause, caused U.S. financial markets to decline. The administration justifies the tariffs as necessary to correct persistent trade deficits, a view many economic experts have criticized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high costs and interest rates, many individuals face unmanageable debt, making bankruptcy a potential solution. The article outlines four clear signs that this legal tool for a fresh start might be the most viable path forward. These indicators include using new debt to pay off existing debt, spending over half of one's income on essential bills, and considering draining retirement accounts. Another major red flag is facing imminent foreclosure or vehicle repossession, where bankruptcy's automatic stay can provide immediate protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer and Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw has criticized the Pittsburgh Steelers for their management of former quarterback Kenny Pickett. Bradshaw argued that the team failed to build a proper roster around the 2022 first-round draft pick, specifically citing a lack of protection from the offensive line and a shortage of offensive weapons. He contended that Pickett, who was traded after two seasons, was not a failure, but rather that the Steelers organization had failed him. Pickett is now with the Cleveland Browns after a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly set to remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. HTS, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, was instrumental in the offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, and its leader is now Syria's interim president. This move aligns with recent efforts by Western nations to reset relations with Syria, including the lifting of sanctions to support the country's recovery. However, concerns remain about the new government's actions, including violent attacks on minority groups and a lack of inclusive appointments.</p>

          <p>Poland's recent decision to implement temporary border checks with Germany and Lithuania is fueling concerns about the erosion of the European Union's Schengen Area. While justified by Poland as a measure against irregular migration, the move follows similar actions by Germany, France, and Austria, creating a pattern of re-nationalizing border control. Experts warn that these checks are often political symbolism with little effect on migration but carry significant economic costs, disrupting trade and daily life in border regions.

However, a lack of a county-level warning system and potential public desensitization to alerts may have contributed to the disaster's scale.

The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, found that the increase was most substantial among females, middle schoolers, and white students. While general handgun possession rose, the study noted a contradictory 60% decrease in students carrying guns inside schools. With firearms now the leading cause of death for U.S. children, the findings underscore the need for tailored prevention strategies.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Paper Indicates Significant Long-Term Risk of Rates Returning to Near Zero</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:02:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research paper co-authored by New York Fed President John Williams suggests there is a significant long-term possibility that the Federal Reserve's key interest rate could return to near-zero levels. While the risk is currently lower than in the past fifteen years, elevated economic uncertainty keeps this prospect in play. A return to such low rates, historically associated with economic crises, poses challenges for the central bank, often forcing it to rely on unconventional tools like bond buying. The paper's analysis is based on interest rate derivatives and highlights the complex outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party." In a social media post, Trump called Musk's move "ridiculous" and said he had gone "completely off the rails." The feud marks a significant falling out between the two, who were previously allies, and stems from disagreements over a recent tax and spending bill that ended EV tax credits. Trump asserted that a two-party system is essential and that a third party only serves to create "disruption and chaos."</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge a provision in a new domestic policy bill that eliminates its funding. The lawsuit argues that the measure is unconstitutional and is specifically designed to punish the organization and prevent its health centers from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. According to the complaint, this would have "catastrophic consequences" for the more than one million patients who rely on its services annually through Medicaid. The organization claims the provision is an attack based on its role in the public debate over abortion.</p>

          <p>A CNBC special report, citing analyses from multiple institutions, explores the growing risks associated with the spiraling U.S. national debt. With the deficit exceeding 6% of GDP, experts warn of potential fallout in markets, the economy, and international relations. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio see classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, while economists note the risk of higher inflation and interest rates that could crowd out private investment. The report highlights that the U.S. may have less than two decades to correct its fiscal path before facing severe consequences. (not investment advice)</p>
