          <p>Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, was released following negotiations between the U.S. and Hamas. Alexander, a New Jersey native serving in the IDF, was captured from his base near Gaza and reunited with his family after a medical assessment. Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his role in securing the release, which is viewed as a goodwill gesture amid ongoing conflict. Despite this release, 57 hostages remain in Gaza, prompting calls for a comprehensive agreement to bring them home and end the war.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash tariffs for 90 days, signaling a de-escalation in their trade war.

          <p>The New York Times article reports that Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli American national, was released following pressure from President Trump, who is set to travel to the region. Hamas released Alexander as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. The article highlights the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce, as Hamas still holds at least 20 living hostages. Critics argue Alexander's release underscores the failure of Netanyahu's military pressure strategy, since he was being released mainly because of U.S. pressure rather than Israeli action.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan has held for a second day, halting the most serious fighting since 1971. Children returned to school and airports reopened, but families mourned the dead from recent strikes. Despite the ceasefire, India has suspended a water treaty, raising concerns in Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi ruled out discussions on the water treaty, focusing only on Kashmir and terrorism in future talks with Pakistan, indicating that tensions remain.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra has announced his candidacy for governor, setting up a potentially competitive primary contest in the GOP. The race is open due to Gov. Kim Reynolds' decision not to seek another term. Feenstra's entry could lead to a high-profile primary, possibly including Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird. On the Democratic side, Iowa state auditor Rob Sand has also entered the race, though Democrats face long odds in the state.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that a brief standoff occurred at the Library of Congress after staff members denied access to two Justice Department officials appointed by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, who has been named acting librarian. This incident is the latest in a battle over the division of authority between Congress and the White House. The two officials arrived with a letter declaring Blanche as acting librarian and outlining their new roles, but were turned away by library staff and the U.S. Capitol Police.</p>

          <p>Despite recent trade deals with China and the United Kingdom, the U.S. tariff rate on imports remains at its highest level since 1934, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. The average effective tariff rate is 17.8%, a 15.4 percentage point increase from before Trump's second term. These tariff policies are expected to cost the average household $2,800 in the short term. Economists anticipate that consumers and businesses will likely adjust their purchasing behavior to avoid the higher costs associated with tariffs.</p>

He also stated that water and blood cannot flow together, referring to the suspension of a water treaty between India and Pakistan. Top military officials from both countries discussed the ceasefire's details, agreeing to refrain from aggressive actions.</p>

Rubio revealed the little-known, now-defunct office within the State Department called the Global Engagement Center (GEC) had compiled disinformation dossiers on Americans across the country as part of an effort to "censor" free speech, including an individual who has since joined the Trump administration. Though Rubio did not identify which Trump official the Biden administration kept a dossier on, Elon Musk has previously railed against the Global Engagement Center.</p>

          <p>Aggressive immigration enforcement tactics by ICE, including arrests in public places, are causing a backlash against President Trump's mass-deportation campaign. While Trump's border security measures remain popular, support for aggressive ICE enforcement in U.S. communities is declining. Political scientist Alexander Kustov attributes this to the "thermostatic" effect of bold executive action and public disapproval of chaotic and indiscriminate deportations, indicating that Trump may be overinterpreting his mandate on immigration.</p>

          <p>US new-vehicle prices surged in April, signaling the effects of President Trump's auto-tariff measures. The average price consumers paid rose 2.5% from March, significantly higher than typical increases. Automakers are adjusting to tariffs on vehicle imports from countries like Mexico and Canada, but some have rolled out deals to maintain sales. Rising consumer demand, driven by expectations of future price increases, has contributed to higher average spending at dealerships.</p>

          <p>Investing $500,000 in an annuity could generate monthly payments ranging from $2,600 to over $5,200, but the precise amount varies based on factors like age, gender, annuity type, and interest rates. Fixed annuities offer predictable payments, while variable annuities fluctuate based on investment performance. Immediate annuities start payments sooner, and deferred annuities allow for growth before payout. Guarantees and inflation protection can affect monthly income, so careful consideration of individual retirement needs and goals is crucial before investing (not investment advice).</p>
