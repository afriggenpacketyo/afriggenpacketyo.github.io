          <p>Families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago are seeking assistance from U.S. government officials and lawmakers to expedite the return of the victims. Takuya Yokota, brother of Megumi Yokota, a symbolic figure among the abductees, and Koichiro Iizuka, son of Yaeko Taguchi, traveled to Washington to convey their concerns. They emphasized the urgency of the matter, especially with the evolving international dynamics and potential rapprochement between the United States and North Korea, highlighting that time is running out for these families to be reunited with their loved ones. The families hope the U.S. will raise the abduction issue during any future negotiations with North Korea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the recent federal election, a surprising outcome influenced by U.S. President Trump's threats of annexation and imposition of tariffs. The campaign was significantly shaped by concerns over Canadian sovereignty, economic stability, and affordability, leading a record number of Canadians to cast their votes early. While domestic issues like immigration and crime remained important, Trump's interventions dominated the political discourse, ultimately impacting voters' choices. Despite the win, it's unclear if the Liberal Party will secure an outright majority, as Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's perceived similarities to Trump may have deterred some voters.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not an error but an oversight corrected due to changed circumstances. Homan claimed Abrego Garcia is now considered a terrorist, as the gang he feared no longer exists, despite a previous withholding order protecting him from deportation due to potential persecution. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny any gang affiliation and point out his lack of criminal record. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has stated he will not return Abrego Garcia to the United States, while a federal judge has temporarily paused orders requiring the Trump administration to provide updates on efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days back in office have been marked by a focus on "America First" policies, including prioritizing US interests in trade and foreign affairs. Key developments include the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, the implementation of sweeping tariffs, and the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump has also taken a firm stance on immigration, expanded the role of ICE, and challenged judges who rule against his policies. His actions have sparked protests and debates over issues such as gender, climate change, and the US Constitution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States, according to a New York Times article. While the 25 percent tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain in place, they will be modified to avoid stacking with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some of the cost of tariffs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of the value of a new car in the first year, phased out over two years. Automakers welcomed the change, stating it helps level the playing field for companies like GM and allows them to invest more in the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major US retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States. This decision comes weeks after escalating tariff hikes between the US and China had significantly slowed down trade. A major exporter of stationery and office products in Ningbo received a notification from Walmart on Monday to resume normal deliveries, with the costs of the new import duties being absorbed by the US clients. This suggests a potential shift in strategy or a negotiation of terms to mitigate the impact of the trade war on supply chains.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese political scientist, Zheng Yongnian, has cautioned Southeast Asian countries (ASEAN) to carefully assess the potential risks of siding too closely with the United States in the ongoing trade war with China. Zheng suggests that such alignment could lead to isolation from China and hinder their economic growth prospects. He argues that the US's primary objective is to bring manufacturing back to America, while China is better positioned to support ASEAN's industrialization goals.

          <p>David Knezevich, a Florida businessman accused of kidnapping and killing his estranged wife in Spain, was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide at a South Florida federal prison. Knezevich, 37, was awaiting trial for the disappearance of 40-year-old Ana Knezevich in Madrid in February 2024. Prosecutors alleged he flew to Turkey, then Serbia, rented a car, and was seen on security video at a Madrid hardware store the day his wife disappeared, with his rental car showing extensive mileage upon its return. The couple was reportedly undergoing a contentious divorce and battling over millions in properties.</p>

          <p>A research team predicts that without serious efforts to combat global warming, students in Japan may no longer be able to participate in extracurricular outdoor sports during the summer months starting in the 2060s. Projections indicate that in a pessimistic global warming scenario, outdoor sporting activities would need to be avoided during certain hours in July and August across most of Japan, excluding Hokkaido. The team's model, based on weather data and heat stress measurements, highlights the potential impact of climate change on daily life and the need to adapt future activities accordingly.</p>

While Trump has temporarily exempted imports from other countries from punitive tariffs, China is focusing on boosting domestic demand through fiscal and monetary policies. A key part of this strategy involves a 10 trillion yuan debt swap plan to help local governments manage debt and reduce interest rates.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed pitcher Tyler Glasnow on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation, raising uncertainty about his return timeline. Glasnow, who had previously expressed confidence in his new, health-conscious mechanics, left a recent start after experiencing a "grabbing" sensation in his shoulder. The setback is particularly frustrating as it may be linked to the changes he made to prevent injuries. With other pitchers also sidelined, the Dodgers face challenges in their rotation as they approach a demanding portion of their schedule.</p>
