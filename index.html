          <p>The Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Prince of Wales, has departed Portsmouth for a significant eight-month deployment, Operation Highmast, involving exercises across the Mediterranean, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Australia. The Â£3 billion aircraft carrier will lead a multinational Carrier Strike Group (CSG) with up to 24 F-35B stealth jets, 16 helicopters, and drones. The deployment aims to demonstrate the UK's ability to conduct large-scale military operations and operate fast jets at sea, though Commodore James Blackmore noted that the program remains agile and could be changed in response to world events. The CSG includes warships from Norway, Canada, and other NATO members, involving 2,500 Royal Navy personnel, 600 from the RAF, and 900 from the British Army.</p>

          <p>Earth Day, founded by former Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson, has been recognized annually on April 22 since 1970, spurring the creation of the EPA and environmental protection laws. Inspired by anti-war teach-ins, Nelson designated April 22, 1970, as a day for teachers to discuss the environment with students, leading to an estimated 20 million Americans participating in demonstrations. While acknowledging progress, Nelson's daughter, Tia Nelson, emphasizes that more action is needed to address climate change and advocates for broadening the conversation to engage diverse communities. Paul Robbins highlights the importance of local action, citing examples like solar panel installations in schools, and companies adopting energy-efficient practices.</p>

          <p>At least five people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists visiting Pahalgam, a popular beauty spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. Several others were wounded in the attack, prompting a response from army and police forces deployed to the scene. The region's chief minister, Omar Abdullah, described the incident as unusually severe for recent years, marking a significant escalation in violence directed at civilians. The attack raises concerns about the safety of tourists in the region and the potential impact on the local tourism industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Georgia has ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose F-1 visas were terminated without notice or explanation. Judge Victoria Calvert granted temporary restraining orders, citing that the terminations exceeded legal authority and likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Fifth Amendment. The students, many in STEM programs, argued that the terminations were a coercive tool to force them to abandon their studies and 'self-deport.' The case will be heard for a preliminary injunction, potentially offering longer-term relief.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have risen to over $3,500 an ounce as concerns over the global trade war and President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve have increased investor demand for safe-haven assets. Trump's public pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates has shaken investors and undermined confidence in the U.S., leading to a sell-off in equity markets. Central banks worldwide are also increasing their gold reserves, further supporting the precious metal's rally. Analysts at UBS suggest that gold will continue to perform well due to ongoing trade uncertainty and central bank diversification.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has increased for a second consecutive day, testing key resistance levels and decoupling from stock market trends. The cryptocurrency has risen approximately 20% from its April 7 low, coinciding with a sell-off in U.S. equities and President Trump's pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin have seen significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. Analysts note that Bitcoin's correlation with equities has decreased, suggesting increased resilience amid market volatility, but caution that low trading volumes could limit further gains without a significant catalyst.

          <p>China's shipyards are experiencing relief as the US Trade Representative (USTR) has scaled back its initial plan to charge Chinese-linked ships entering American ports. The final plan includes a phased fee structure with several exemptions, reducing the pressure on Chinese shipbuilders. The most significant change is the removal of a previous proposal to charge fees based on the number of Chinese-made vessels in a company's fleet or orders placed with Chinese shipbuilders. This adjustment alleviates concerns among clients about placing orders with Chinese shipyards.</p>

However, concerns about safety and citizenship rights persist, with many Rohingya wary of the Arakan Army, which controls much of Rakhine State.

          <p>Norwich City has dismissed head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup and appointed former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as interim manager for the remaining two games of the season. The decision follows a run of six defeats in eight Championship matches. Sporting director Ben Knapper acknowledged that while Thorup was hired with a long-term focus, recent results necessitated a change. Wilshere, previously manager of Arsenal's under-18 team and a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley.</p>

          <p>Climate change is increasingly threatening the $100 billion U.S. fishing industry, as warming rivers reduce oxygen levels and harm trout populations. A recent study found that 87% of rivers studied across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70% losing oxygen. Warmer waters are making it harder for guides to make a living on historic rivers like the Beaver Kill River in New York's Catskill Mountains. Nonprofits are working to restore river flow by removing old dams and reinforcing banks to combat the effects of climate change and erosion.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, the first such signal since the early stages of the war. This comes as Russian strikes continue on Ukrainian cities, resulting in casualties and damage. Putin's comments suggest a possible openness to discussing the cessation of strikes on civilian targets. Zelensky has proposed a 30-day ceasefire on civilian infrastructure, following a brief Easter truce marked by mutual accusations of breaches. The US President expressed hope for a deal, while Zelensky emphasized the need for a clear answer from Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While tariffs may raise prices, the climate crisis poses a more significant long-term inflation risk. Rising damage costs from droughts, wildfires, and floods are causing insurance costs to soar, affecting housing and other sectors. Climate change is also impacting food supplies, with projected temperature increases expected to increase food inflation by 0.92 to 3.23% per year. The Trump administration's war on climate change research and doubling down on carbon-based business models exacerbate the problem, as does the global community's move away from decarbonization efforts.</p>

          <p>The Republican Party's coalition is held together by a synthesis of authoritarianism and libertarianism, where traditional conservatives receive low taxes for the rich, while natcons get a free hand to wield state power against their enemies. While Republican politicians often make misleading promises to raise taxes on the rich, their actions consistently favor tax cuts for the affluent. The addition of a national-conservative faction, led by Vice President J. D. Vance, has introduced a new dynamic, but has not fundamentally altered the party's stance on taxation. The alliance between the more libertarian faction and the natcons has been tested, but not shattered, by Trumpâs trade war.</p>
