          <p>Ten candidates vying for California governor in 2026 offered their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure, highlighting both successes and areas for improvement. Democrats Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra praised Newsom's actions on redistricting and the economy, respectively, while suggesting quicker action on housing and high-speed rail. Republicans Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton criticized Newsom, with Bianco seeing little positive and Hilton agreeing only on smartphone limits. The candidates collectively emphasized future priorities like healthcare, affordable housing, and fiscal accountability, reflecting diverse visions for California's direction.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Kirk, 31, was shot during an outdoor debate, an event described as a "targeted attack." Robinson, who is not a student, was identified after his father urged him to surrender, and messages on Discord appeared to confess to the crime. The FBI recovered a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with unusual inscriptions, and while a motive remains unclear, officials believe Robinson acted alone.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump initially claimed unfamiliarity with the assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, a Democrat killed this summer, when questioned about his decision to lower flags for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Critics, including a CBS News correspondent, pressed Trump on his administration's perceived selective mourning and tendency to blame the left for political violence. Trump stated he would have lowered flags if the governor had asked, but previously dismissed the Minnesota governor as "whacked out." This article highlights political polarization and the perceived double standards in responding to political violence.</p>

          <p>A memorial mural honoring the late conservative leader Charlie Kirk on Pensacola's Graffiti Bridge was defaced with offensive messages, including "a good Nazi is a dead Nazi" and "Free Palestine." In response, a group of young people gathered to restore the tribute, covering the hateful graffiti with Bible verses and positive messages. They expressed dismay at the disrespect shown, emphasizing Kirk's advocacy for free speech and open debate. This act of community restoration highlights the polarizing reactions to Kirk's death and efforts to counter negativity.</p>

This rise followed President Donald Trump's announcement that U.S.-China trade negotiations in Spain were progressing favorably. The positive sentiment was further bolstered by a "framework" deal regarding the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, signaling potential easing of trade tensions. Other Asian markets also saw gains, reflecting investor optimism about global trade relations and economic stability, despite an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting in the U.S.</p>

Her company, which generated over $20 million last year, empowers immigrants and others by providing pathways to build credit. Kim advocates for early financial literacy and starting with small, manageable loans to establish a positive borrowing history, aiming to transform a challenging system.</p>

UCLA issued a statement condemning the celebration of violence while upholding free expression, launching an investigation into the employee's remarks.

          <p>A CBS News review of FAA reports reveals that airplane fume incidents occur more than three times a day, raising serious health concerns for passengers and crew members. Experts, like Dr. Robert Harrison, note that these fumes, often described as smelling like dirty socks, can be toxic and cause nervous system problems. The issue is particularly prevalent on Airbus A320 jets, which accounted for 61% of reported incidents last year. Flight attendant associations are advocating for improved filtration systems, as current designs can allow engine oil and other particles into cabin air if seals fail.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's governing board, just ahead of a critical interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower ruling, finding that firing Cook would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act, which protects the central bank's independence from political pressure. Trump had cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, who denies wrongdoing. This decision prevents Trump from immediately appointing a fourth nominee and gaining a majority on the board, underscoring the legal and political battle over the Fed's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Legendary quarterback Tom Brady will participate in a flag football tournament in Saudi Arabia next March, alongside other NFL stars and retired players. This event, the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, is part of the NFL's strategy to expand its global presence and Saudi Arabia's broader investment in sports to diversify its economy. While not a return to professional football, Brady views it as an opportunity to raise awareness for the sport internationally. The tournament, sponsored by Fanatics, highlights the intersection of sports, business, and geopolitical soft power initiatives.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger strongly criticized the partisan effort to redraw California's congressional districts, urging students to vote against Proposition 50, which he views as undermining democratic principles. Speaking at USC, he reflected on Charlie Kirk's assassination as a tragic consequence of extreme political polarization, emphasizing the importance of respectful disagreement. Schwarzenegger, a long-time advocate for independent redistricting, warned against the nation spiraling towards a loss of democracy, blaming social media, traditional media, and political parties for dividing Americans. He called for unity and a reversal of this trend.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK is meticulously planned but fraught with potential controversies, including anticipated protests and the recent dismissal of the UK ambassador to the US. Despite extensive logistical preparations at Windsor Castle, the visit is compressed, lacking key engagements like a Downing Street visit or parliamentary address. The UK government aims for Trump to depart with a positive disposition towards Britain, focusing on ceremonial pomp and securing deals on steel tariffs and technology partnerships. However, profound policy differences and the Mandelson affair could overshadow the diplomatic objectives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that companies transition from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a suggestion the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is actively reviewing. Trump argues this change would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy, contrasting with China's longer-term business view. While current regulations require quarterly reports, the SEC could alter these rules with a majority vote. Supporters of the current system emphasize its transparency and timely information for investors, while critics, including Warren Buffett, have also advocated for less frequent guidance to combat short-termism.

A public humanities expert stated that such language reinforces negative gender stereotypes, belittling men who don't fit hyper-masculine ideals and insulting women.

Concerns over TikTok's Chinese ownership and potential data access or propaganda spread had driven the ban efforts.
