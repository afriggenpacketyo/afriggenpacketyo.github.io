          <p>Target has revised its sales outlook for the year, citing decreased discretionary spending, tariff uncertainties, and negative reactions to adjustments in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The company's first-quarter sales fell short of expectations, experiencing a nearly 3% drop compared to the previous year, with both transaction numbers and average customer spending declining. CEO Brian Cornell attributed these challenges primarily to economic factors, but acknowledged the need for improvement, particularly in expanding market share across various merchandise categories. In response to these difficulties, Target has announced leadership changes and the establishment of an Enterprise Acceleration Office focused on streamlining operations and accelerating growth.</p>

          <p>China's military is exploring methods to counteract the increasing role of artificial intelligence in combat strategies of potential adversaries. According to the PLA Daily, future warfare will require the ability to undermine an opponent's AI processing capabilities by targeting data, algorithms, and computing power. Strategies involve 'polluting' data to reduce the accuracy of an adversary's language models, using camouflage to mislead enemy learning processes, and employing irregular maneuvers to prevent foreign forces from predicting drone swarm routes. These tactics reflect China's emphasis on 'deceptive warfare' to maintain a strategic advantage in future conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fragments of West Nile virus have been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The virus was found in two samples of Aedes vexans mosquitoes as part of a research program conducted by the UKHSA and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). While there have been no cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK to date, health officials have indicated that the risk to the general public is very low. Experts suggest that the detection of the virus is related to climate change and the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases into new areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Efforts to downgrade marijuana from the government's most restrictive drug category have stalled, despite initial bipartisan support and endorsements from both former President Biden and then-candidate Trump. Resistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) during the Biden administration slowed the process and led to legal challenges, creating a time-consuming legal battle. Critics argue that downgrading cannabis could encourage harmful drug use, while supporters maintain that it would facilitate medical research and reduce criminal penalties. The DEA's drawn-out process and alleged behind-the-scenes assistance to rescheduling opponents have led to accusations of unfairness and further delays, casting uncertainty on the future of federal cannabis reform.</p>

          <p>Six civilians were killed in the crossfire of clashes between two armed groups near the Mexican resort city of Acapulco, according to authorities. The violence occurred in the town of Kilometro 30, leaving five men and an elderly woman dead and three others injured. Soldiers and police recovered weapons from an armored vehicle at the scene, where several cars were also set ablaze. Acapulco, once a popular tourist destination, has been plagued by violence linked to drug cartels, with the U.S. State Department advising Americans to avoid travel to the state of Guerrero due to high crime rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, primarily driven by increased household bills for water, gas, and electricity. This rise exceeds economists' expectations and pushes inflation further above the Bank of England's 2% target. The Office for National Statistics highlighted housing, household services, transport, recreation, and culture as significant contributors to the increase. The Bank of England anticipates inflation to peak at 3.7% later in the year before declining, but the recent data casts doubt on potential interest rate cuts, causing concern among analysts and government officials.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public access for 'open-air recreation,' including camping. Campaigners and Dartmoor National Park officials celebrated the decision, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and the need for government support in managing the area. The judgment is expected to reignite discussions about expanding public access to land across England.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group secretly incentivized nursing homes with bonuses to reduce hospital transfers, a cost-cutting tactic that jeopardized residents' health. Under the program, UnitedHealth stationed its medical teams in nursing homes and pressured them to cut expenses. In several cases, residents needing immediate hospital care were denied it, leading to permanent health damage. The initiative, which is linked to increased Medicare Advantage profits, involved tracking hospital admissions and pressuring patients to change their code status to 'do not resuscitate'.</p>

          <p>The bombing of an IVF clinic in Palm Springs, California, is raising concerns about the role of online extremism in motivating violent acts. The suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, held fringe theories of antinatalism and nihilism, which he may have found validated in online spaces. Experts suggest that the internet can amplify psychological distress and provide a platform for lone actors to connect with extreme ideologies. The incident underscores the challenge of identifying and preventing attacks by individuals who become radicalized online.</p>
