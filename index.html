          <p>Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept civilian planes that repeatedly violated restricted airspace over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey property over the weekend. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) confirmed seven violations, including one where flares were deployed to gain a pilot's attention before safely escorting the aircraft out. NORAD emphasized the importance of pilots adhering to temporary flight restrictions, warning that ignorance is not a defense for entering designated zones. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about airspace security around presidential residences.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion stock-based pay package for CEO Elon Musk, consisting of 96 million restricted shares. This decision comes six months after a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 $56 billion compensation, which Musk is currently appealing. The company aims to retain Musk's leadership through what it views as an "inflection point" as Tesla transitions into an AI-first entity, amidst intensifying competition for AI talent. The new award is designed to incentivize Musk to remain at the company, removing a perceived overhang on the stock.</p>

The incident, which occurred at 6:19 a.m., resulted in several people being treated for smoke inhalation. Video footage captured passengers panicking as they attempted to exit the smoke-filled train, while flames were visible spitting from beneath the cars on the track. The blaze suspended the Hoboken-WTC and JSQ-33rd Street lines, significantly disrupting morning commutes, with fire officials investigating the cause.</p>

          <p>The European Union announced a six-month suspension of its planned countermeasures against U.S. tariffs, which were set to begin this week. This delay stems from an agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump on July 27, aimed at restoring stability in transatlantic trade. The EU seeks to finalize a joint statement with the U.S. and will formally implement the pause on countermeasures, allowing for continued negotiations. The move represents a concession from the EU following weeks of discussions, despite lingering questions about the enforceability of certain aspects of the broader trade deal.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent uptick in inflation, experts anticipate Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates will largely remain stable through August and into the fall.

While some banks have slightly lowered rates in anticipation of future rate cuts, the overall expectation is for minimal change. Savers are advised to consider shorter-term CDs or high-yield savings accounts due to current market uncertainty and the potential for future rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bartenders in Washington D.C. are facing increased challenges as political polarization under the Trump administration creates palpable tension in hospitality venues. Traditionally, a neutral stance on politics was maintained, but the current climate makes this difficult, with some progressive bar owners toning down their rhetoric for staff safety. Even establishments perceived as pro-Trump, like Butterworth’s, experience disruptions and hiring difficulties due to their political association. Despite the challenges, some bar professionals remain optimistic that open, constructive dialogues in inclusive spaces can still foster common ground among patrons.</p>

          <p>After a decade of intensive research, scientists have identified Vibrio pectenicida as the primary bacterial culprit behind the devastating sea star wasting disease. This mysterious illness, which caused sea stars to disintegrate and wiped out millions along the West Coast since 2013, significantly impacted marine ecosystems, leading to the collapse of kelp forests. Researchers painstakingly isolated the bacterium from infected sea stars and successfully demonstrated its ability to transmit the disease. This breakthrough provides crucial insight, offering a roadmap for developing better strategies to protect and recover vulnerable sea star populations, including the critically affected sunflower sea star.</p>

          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires is significantly impacting air quality for millions across the U.S. Midwest and Northeast, triggering air quality alerts in multiple states. On Monday morning, Detroit's air quality ranked among the worst globally, with areas around the Great Lakes and the U.S.-Canada border experiencing "unhealthy" or "unhealthy for sensitive groups" ratings on the Air Quality Index. The smoke is expected to spread further into the Northeast in the coming days. This ongoing environmental event poses health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations with respiratory or heart conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts suggest that a favorable home equity loan rate in August 2025 would likely range between 7% and 10%, with anything below 8.25% for a 10-year term or 8.20% for a 15-year term considered good. Key factors influencing rates include credit score (740+ for lower rates), loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (lower LTV for better rates), debt-to-income (DTI) ratio (below 43% preferred), and loan term (shorter terms often have lower rates). Borrowers are advised to shop around, improve credit scores, borrow only what's needed, and consider total costs beyond just the rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and Technology Group, against NBCUniversal. The lawsuit stemmed from comments made by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC in March 2021, regarding a package Nunes received from a suspected Russian agent and his alleged failure to hand it over to the FBI. Judge Kevin Castel ruled that Nunes failed to prove Maddow acted with actual malice, finding no clear evidence she knew her statements were false or showed reckless disregard for the truth. This decision upholds protections for journalists against such claims.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics, are expressing deep disappointment and alarm after being excluded from the CDC's vaccine recommendation workgroups. These groups, whose experts have long provided unbiased input to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), view the decision as irresponsible and dangerous to public health. They argue that removing their expertise will undermine trust in vaccine guidance and lead to confusing, fragmented recommendations. This change follows previous alterations to the ACIP under the current administration, raising concerns about the politicization of health policy.</p>

          <p>NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff will transition to MSNBC full-time as the progressive cable channel spins off into a new standalone company named Versant. This separation means MSNBC will develop its own editorial operations, no longer relying on NBC News resources, and will remove the NBC peacock from its logo. Soboroff, known for his aggressive coverage of southern border issues, is the highest-profile talent to make this move. While most NBC News staffers are staying with the broadcast network, a surprising number of correspondents and executives are opting for Versant, despite the challenges facing cable TV.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a dip after the conglomerate reported a 4% year-over-year decline in second-quarter operating earnings, totaling $11.16 billion. The results also revealed a continued stock-selling spree and a halt on share repurchases, disappointing investors. Despite higher profits in some sectors, a drop in insurance underwriting contributed to the overall decline. The company also recorded a significant $3.8 billion loss from its Kraft Heinz stake, which had been carried above market value. Analysts suggest that increased investment activity or a large acquisition could serve as near-term catalysts for the stock.</p>

          <p>Democrats are being urged to capitalize on recent economic data and President Trump's controversial responses, which critics argue contradict his claims of a "golden age." Following a weak jobs report and an uptick in inflation, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and publicly attacked the Federal Reserve chair. This commentary piece suggests these actions, along with the unpopular "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and potential threats to Social Security, provide ample material for Democrats to challenge Trump's economic narrative. It calls for Democrats to focus on the concerns of average voters.</p>

          <p>China's air force claims to have developed a "kill chain" strategy enabling older warplanes to successfully engage more advanced stealth fighters using guided missiles. State broadcaster CCTV reported on an exercise where a 10-year-old J-10C fighter, aided by airborne warning and control system (AWACS) planes, outmaneuvered an unidentified stealth aircraft. This approach emphasizes the combined power of multiple systems, including electronic warfare platforms, over individual fighter capabilities. The development suggests a potential method for the People's Liberation Army to counter advanced American warplanes, drawing parallels to tactics used by Pakistan in a recent conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical associate professor of pharmacy explains that a significant number of reported penicillin allergies are misdiagnosed, with far fewer people actually allergic than commonly believed. Many individuals are labeled as allergic in childhood due to rashes accompanying infections, not the antibiotic itself, or from non-allergic side effects like nausea. Furthermore, about 80% of true penicillin allergies are lost after about 10 years, and they are not hereditary. Incorrectly believing one has an allergy can lead to less effective, more expensive, and broader-spectrum antibiotic treatments, increasing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Consulting a healthcare professional can help determine true allergy status.</p>
