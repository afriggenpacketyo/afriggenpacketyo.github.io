          <h2>BP Reports Lower Profits Amid Strategic Shift and Crude Price Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's first-quarter net profit fell to $1.38 billion, missing analyst expectations due to lower crude prices and a strategic reset focusing on oil and gas. CEO Murray Auchincloss highlighted strong operational performance, including record upstream efficiency and refinery output. Despite activist investor pressure to further prioritize oil and gas, BP is proceeding with a $750 million share buyback and an 8-cent dividend per share. Auchincloss dismissed speculation about a potential takeover, emphasizing BP's sector-leading growth and independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, won Canada's federal election, marking a turnaround attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Voters prioritized Canadian sovereignty and economic stability in response to Trump's actions. While domestic issues like affordability and immigration remained important, Trump's influence dominated the campaign. Carney emphasized unity and standing up to Trump, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was criticized for perceived similarities to the American president.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to form Canada's next government, marking an historic turnaround for a party that looked to be headed for collapse just months ago. But as results continue to be declared, the party has not secured a clear majority in parliament - meaning it may have to work to unite Canadians in the face of tariffs and threats from US President Donald Trump. Carney presented himself during the campaign as the most experienced leader in a time of crisis. He warned that Trump is trying to break Canada so America can own it.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party won Canada's federal election, with opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceding defeat. Carney stated that Canada will "win this trade war" with the US, following Trump's renewed calls to make Canada the 51st US state. Trump's tariffs and comments about Canada's sovereignty influenced voters, causing some NDP supporters to shift to the Liberals. Carney called for a "strong, positive mandate" after replacing Trudeau, facing off against Conservative Pierre Poilievre.</p>

While executive orders allow for swift policy implementation, they are susceptible to legal challenges and can be overturned by future presidents, making legislation a more durable route for lasting change.</p>
