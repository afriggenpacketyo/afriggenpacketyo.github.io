        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. An Education Department spokesperson stated that this decision reflects the administration's commitment to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on a fixed income. This is a significant shift in policy, as the administration had previously announced the resumption of collection activity on the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio after a nearly half-decade pause due to Covid-era policies. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering a budget package passed by the House, but several GOP senators are pushing for revisions, creating potential roadblocks to its passage. Key sticking points include Medicaid changes, deeper spending cuts, clean energy tax credits, and the state and local tax deduction. Some senators are concerned about the impact of Medicaid cuts on low-income Americans and rural hospitals, while others are advocating for more significant spending reductions. The Senate is also divided on rolling back clean energy tax credits and increasing the debt ceiling, and these disagreements could lead to significant changes to the House-passed bill.

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the popular collectible character Labubu, is gaining international recognition, prompting analysts to compare its success to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty. Labubu, a cute monster charm, has attracted a global fanbase, including celebrities like David Beckham's family, and has driven Pop Mart's stock to record highs. Some analysts suggest that Labubu's appeal lies in its ability to tap into universal emotions through strong design and clever marketing, representing a new model for Chinese cultural exports. The article also notes Pop Mart's surge in international sales, particularly in the US and Europe, which has made it a favorite among investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly stated during a daily briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, leaving FEMA staff confused and dispirited. It is unclear whether the remark was meant literally or as a joke, but it has raised concerns about Richardson's preparedness for the upcoming season. This comes amid low morale within the agency due to resignations, firings, leadership overhauls, and polygraph tests. NOAA has predicted an above-average hurricane season, with the Atlantic hurricane season officially running from June 1 through November.</p>

The study, which surveyed 110 parents and their babies, found that infants who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Researchers encourage parents to sing any songs they like, not just traditional lullabies, to provide their babies with the opportunity to hear their voice. NPR is inviting parents to upload recordings of themselves singing to their babies, with the possibility of the submissions being featured on Morning Edition.</p>

Based on Karin Slaughter’s New York Times-bestselling novel series “Will Trent,” showrunners Liz Heldens and Daniel Thomsen organically tailored the titular role to reflect Rodriguez’s real-life Puerto Rican identity.

          <p>President Trump has frequently discussed antisemitism, but his response to the recent attack in Colorado targeting a pro-Israel demonstration notably lacked any specific reference to Jewish people. This omission has drawn attention and raised questions about the nuances of his approach to addressing antisemitism. The article highlights the contrast between his general statements on the issue and his specific reactions to events impacting the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>Greg Rosen, the head of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has resigned, citing President Trump's pardons of the January 6 rioters as sending a "terrible message." Rosen believes the pardons suggest that political violence is acceptable, undermining the foundations of a constitutional republic. He also criticized the demotion or firing of prosecutors who handled the January 6 cases, calling it an affront to the independence of the department. Rosen is transitioning to a private law firm, where he will focus on representing clients facing government scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian shelling and drone attacks have resulted in power cuts across Russian-controlled territories in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine. While officials reported that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station's operations were unaffected, emergency measures were implemented, and key sites were switched to reserve power sources. The attacks prompted Russia-installed governors to introduce emergency measures and switch key sites to reserve power sources, and this marks a shift from earlier in the conflict when Ukrainian towns and villages faced similar electricity cuts due to Russian attacks.</p>

While negotiations between the two countries continue, the U.S. is expressing disappointment with the lack of progress and Russia's demands. President Trump's frustration with the situation has reportedly led to increased disengagement, and the administration has not taken steps to impose new sanctions on Moscow despite previous threats. As attacks intensify, Ukraine is urging stronger action from the U.S. to pressure Russia toward a ceasefire.</p>
