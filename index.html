          <h2>Humanitarian Groups Warn of Worsening Famine in Gaza Strip</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 15:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International aid organizations report that the Gaza Strip is experiencing a severe hunger crisis, with predictions that the entire population will soon face acute food insecurity. The situation has rapidly worsened, with a significant rise in malnutrition-related deaths, particularly among children, despite Israeli claims to the contrary. While some aid is entering through limited humanitarian pauses and a new US-Israeli-backed foundation, critics argue these measures are dangerously insufficient and inefficient. Experts stress that only an end to the war and the unimpeded flow of aid through established UN channels can avert a full-scale famine.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a statement, she mentioned a period of deep reflection led to her decision, stating her public service will continue outside of elected office for now. This move clears a potential frontrunner from the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom and keeps open the possibility of another presidential campaign in 2028. Harris also hinted at a need for new methods and thinking within the Democratic party following her 2024 election loss.</p>

          <h2>Justice Department Reveals Epstein Grand Jury Transcripts Contain Testimony from Only Two Law Enforcement Witnesses</h2>

          <p>The Department of Justice has disclosed in a court filing that the grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell investigations contain testimony from only two witnesses: an FBI agent and an NYPD detective. This revelation comes as the DOJ, under direction from the Trump administration, seeks to unseal the records to address public interest and speculation. Notably, no alleged victims testified directly before the grand juries that issued the indictments. The department argues that releasing the transcripts would inform the public about the investigation's scope while being sensitive to victims' rights.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve deciding to keep its benchmark interest rate paused, borrowers facing high-interest debt, particularly on credit cards, are unlikely to see relief soon. Financial advisors suggest this is a critical time for individuals to explore debt relief options to regain financial stability. Recommended actions include conducting a thorough budget review to identify savings, understanding the risks and benefits associated with options like debt management programs, and addressing the root causes of debt accumulation. These proactive steps can help borrowers manage their financial health while waiting for potential future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An extremely powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves and prompting evacuation orders across the Pacific, including Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan.

          <p>The ruling party in the Central African Republic (CAR) has nominated President Faustin-Archange Touadera for a third term, raising concerns among opposition and civil society groups. This follows a controversial 2023 referendum that abolished the two-term limit and extended the presidential mandate from five to seven years. The opposition, which boycotted the referendum, alleges fraud and fears the move could allow Touadera to remain in power for life. Amid persistent civil conflict and questions about the integrity of the upcoming 2025 elections, opposition leaders are demanding a national dialogue before proceeding with the electoral process.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life in a shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, identified as Shane D. Tamura, left a note suggesting he believed he had CTE and appeared to blame the National Football League, which has offices in the building. Investigators believe he intended to target the NFL but went to the wrong floor. The victims included the officer, a security guard, and employees from two different firms in the building. The investigation is ongoing, examining the shooter's mental health history and how he acquired the high-powered rifle used in the attack.</p>

          <p>High Noon is recalling two lots of its Beach Variety 12-packs of vodka seltzer due to a packaging error that resulted in some cans being mislabeled as Celsius energy drinks. The recall was initiated after a supplier mistakenly shipped empty Celsius cans to a High Noon facility, leading to the potential for unintended alcohol consumption. The affected products were distributed to several states, including Florida, New York, and Wisconsin. The FDA announcement advises consumers to dispose of any affected cans, which can be identified by lot codes and a silver lid instead of the usual black one.</p>

          <p>The city council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, a town near Stuttgart, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a mosque that is nearly finished. The decision stems from a contractual dispute with the Cologne-based Islamic association (VIKZ) that built it. The association was granted a building permit in 2014 but failed to complete construction within the contractually obligated four-year period. After a lengthy legal battle that went to Germany's highest court, the town revoked the permit and has now ordered the building to be torn down, a demand the Islamic association says it will not follow.</p>

          <p>Despite facing billions of dollars in costs from tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and foreign-made vehicles, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows that new car price increases have remained below average, as companies absorb the financial hit to maintain market share and avoid deterring already-stretched buyers. However, companies like GM, Volkswagen, and Stellantis have reported massive tariff-related losses to investors. Analysts predict this situation is temporary and that consumers will likely see higher prices or reduced incentives when 2026 models arrive later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent immigration enforcement raids under the Trump administration are already having a measurable negative impact on California's economy. Researchers analyzing census data found a significant drop in the number of people reporting to work when the raids began, a downturn comparable only to the COVID-19 lockdown period. Economists warn that the disruption to the immigrant workforce, which is crucial to sectors like agriculture and construction, could hobble businesses and have ripple effects on the state's GDP.

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a former nuclear weapons production facility, have discovered and removed a radioactive wasp nest. Routine monitoring detected the nest on a post near liquid nuclear waste storage tanks with radiation levels 10 times higher than federal regulations permit. Officials stated there is no leak from the tanks and believe the wasps built the nest using materials with legacy radioactive contamination from the site's operational days. A watchdog group has criticized the official report as incomplete, demanding more information on the source of the contamination.</p>

          <p>As Americans struggle with record-high credit card balances, credit card debt forgiveness programs can offer a path to relief by reducing the total amount owed. However, not everyone is eligible for these programs. The article explains that the strongest candidates are typically those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, which they can document. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt (often over $10,000) and those who have already fallen behind on payments are also more likely to successfully negotiate a settlement with creditors.</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has revealed extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing more than 31,000 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean's Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. Scientists believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down from above, but on chemicals produced by microbes that process carbon accumulated in the trenches over time. The discovery suggests that such complex ecosystems in the deepest parts of the ocean may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>

While fixed-rate mortgages are not directly tied to the Fed's rate, uncertainty has kept them in a high range, impacting housing affordability. Similarly, auto loan rates are near record levels, and the high rates on savings accounts, a positive for savers, are also expected to persist as a result of the Fed's decision.
