          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, says his son had changed after moving to Twentynine Palms. Richard Bartkus stated that he hadn't spoken to his 25-year-old son in over a decade and that his son was once someone who tried to help people. Federal investigators are treating the case as an international act of terrorism, and are examining Bartkus' online posts indicating anti-natalist beliefs. The FBI is seeking public assistance in identifying Bartkus' movements within Palm Springs before the explosion, which they believe he attempted to livestream.</p>

Sir Keir Starmer is meeting with EU leaders to finalize the agreement, with government sources reporting significant progress.

          <p>President Trump's budget package cleared a key hurdle in the House after negotiations with conservative Republicans who initially opposed the bill due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and increases military and border security spending, is offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. While Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in passing the legislation, it still faces challenges from conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, as well as opposition from moderate Republicans concerned about state and local tax deductions.</p>

Finland, a recent NATO member, shares an 830-mile border with Russia, which military analysts predict could become a potential hot spot.

          <p>This article argues that Russia's aggression in Ukraine mirrors the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, marked by forced citizenship, property confiscation, and attacks on national identity. The author asserts that the failure to acknowledge the Soviet occupation as a crime has enabled Russia to repeat these actions. They urge Western Europe to recognize the experiences of those who lived under Soviet rule and to build a cultural and historical concept countering Russia's divisive tactics. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for mutual knowledge and compassion to strengthen unity and counter narratives that excuse Russia's actions.</p>

This system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, aims to prevent individuals with criminal records or prior illegal stays from boarding planes to Japan.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidential election after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion had a strong first-round victory, fueled by anger over the annulled election, but Dan secured 54% of the vote. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election reflects broader dissatisfaction with mainstream parties in Romania, an EU and NATO member state.</p>
