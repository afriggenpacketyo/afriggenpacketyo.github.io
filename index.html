          <p>Home Depot has announced its intention to acquire GMS, a distributor of building products, for about $4.3 billion. The acquisition will be carried out by Home Depot's subsidiary, SRS Distribution, and is expected to close by early 2026. This strategic move aims to increase Home Depot's market share among professional contractors, such as electricians and renovators, a more consistent and profitable segment of the home improvement business. The deal also effectively ends a potential hostile takeover of GMS by billionaire Brad Jacobs's company, QXO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has initiated a "vote-a-rama," a lengthy series of amendment votes, on President Trump's major spending and tax bill. The legislation, which includes increased funding for border security and defense offset by cuts to social programs, narrowly passed the House and now faces intense debate in the Senate. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years. Republicans are pushing to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, navigating dissent from within their own party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the 1967 murder and sexual assault of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, UK. The case, considered one of the UK's oldest solved cold cases, remained unsolved for nearly six decades until modern DNA testing linked Headley to the crime scene. Investigators connected a semen swab from 1967 to Headley, a man previously convicted of sexual assault and described as a "dangerous serial offender." His palm print also matched one found at the victim's home, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a second significant heatwave with temperatures expected to exceed 30C, a phenomenon linked to a "heat dome" over Europe. Climate scientists assert that while such weather events have natural causes, their intensity and frequency are undeniably amplified by human-induced climate change, which has warmed the planet by 1.36C. Data shows that days over 32C are now more than three times as common as they were in the 1961-1990 period. This trend highlights the increasing regularity of extreme heat events in the UK.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a move that experts believe could significantly disrupt the AI industry. This decision marks a strategic shift for Baidu, which previously favored a proprietary model, and is seen as a competitive response to other open-source successes like DeepSeek. Analysts suggest that by offering a powerful model potentially at a lower cost, Baidu could pressure competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, raising the bar for the entire industry. However, the move also brings up concerns about security and data privacy.</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as a source for drones and their components, aiming to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on China. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by security concerns and China's export controls. While a complete decoupling from China's dominant drone market is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on sourcing critical parts like software and chips from Taiwan. This move reflects a broader European effort to build a "non-red" supply chain for sensitive technologies.</p>

MacRae sued, claiming a violation of her First Amendment free speech rights.

          <p>A coalition of American families who have lost loved ones to cartel violence is formally urging the Trump administration to designate the Juárez Cartel and its armed wing, La Línea, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the group argues that the FTO label would criminalize material support for the groups and help prevent future violence. This push follows the administration's earlier designation of eight other drug cartels, a policy that broadens the traditional use of the FTO label beyond extremist groups.</p>

However, unlike a virus, it possesses the genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA, which are essential for protein synthesis.

          <h2>New UK-US Tariff Reduction Deal Takes Effect, but Steel Issue Remains Unresolved</h2>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States that reduces tariffs on certain goods has officially come into force. The agreement gives British carmakers preferential access to the U.S. market and eliminates tariffs on UK aerospace exports. In exchange, the UK has scrapped tariffs on U.S. beef and ethanol. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% U.S. tariff, which could double if a separate deal is not reached by a July 9 deadline.</p>

          <p>Beijing is expressing concern that trade agreements being negotiated between the United States and other nations could be designed to undermine China's economy. Chinese officials and analysts worry these deals might compel countries to divert supply chains away from China or exit Beijing-led initiatives. The warning comes as a 90-day window for the U.S. to conclude tariff negotiations with most of its trading partners approaches its deadline. China fears that these bilateral U.S. deals could lead to a broader economic and strategic disengagement from its economy.</p>
