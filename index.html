          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to justify the success of their COVID-19 drugs, questioning why positive results from companies like Pfizer are not more widely shared. His demand comes amid significant leadership changes at the CDC, including the firing of its director, and ongoing public debate involving figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Trump urged drugmakers to release their data to clarify the effectiveness of the vaccines and therapeutics developed under his administration's Operation Warp Speed initiative.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," showcases the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, an orchestra celebrated for its unique democratic structure and financial independence. Founded by music students in 1980, all members have a say in artistic and operational decisions, which its managing director credits for its high level of motivation and success. The film highlights the orchestra's journey from a "hippie commune" to a world-class ensemble under conductor Paavo Järvi, linking its collaborative spirit to the democratic ideals in Joseph Haydn's music.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 21 others injured. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, fired through the church windows before taking their own life. Authorities are investigating the motive, with the FBI treating it as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. The shooter, whose mother previously worked at the church, had posted videos online detailing plans for an attack.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has agreed to a deal for striker Nicolas Jackson to join Bayern Munich, concluding a prolonged transfer saga. The arrangement involves an initial loan fee of £14.3 million, with a mandatory purchase obligation of £56.2 million based on appearances, bringing the total value over £70 million. Jackson, who joined Chelsea from Villarreal in 2023, reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards last season. The move is structured to allow Jackson to potentially face his former club in the Champions League.</p>

          <p>The body of Grant Gardner, a 38-year-old hiker from Minnesota, was found in Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains nearly a month after he went missing. Gardner had sent a final text to his wife from the summit of Cloud Peak, stating the climb was more taxing than expected. A professional climbing team discovered his remains under a ledge after noticing a reflection from his backpack. Authorities believe he succumbed to a tragic accident, and the discovery is expected to bring closure to his family, including his two children.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as a post-conflict security measure. Pistorius deemed it "completely wrong" to publicly discuss such sensitive topics before any peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow have occurred. He emphasized that the EU lacks the jurisdiction for troop deployments and urged caution, even while acknowledging that internal deliberations on potential future scenarios are ongoing.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement could severely impact key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy, which heavily relies on immigrant labor. Industries like agriculture, construction, and hospitality face significant disruption, with a joint study estimating a potential loss of up to $278 billion from the state's GDP. While advocates argue these workers are essential for the economy, the White House maintains its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens and that the domestic labor market can absorb any shortages.</p>

She argues that during the initial years of a 30-year loan, payments primarily cover interest, resulting in slow equity growth. According to her, if a buyer cannot afford the higher monthly payments of a 15-year term, they likely cannot truly afford the home once hidden costs like maintenance, furnishing, and increased utilities are factored in.

          <p>The deadly earthquake in eastern Afghanistan presents immense challenges for rescue efforts and accurate reporting due to several key factors. The epicenter is in a remote, mountainous region with poor infrastructure, which has been further damaged by landslides, hampering access for aid workers. Since the Taliban's takeover in 2021, international aid has been severely curtailed and many foreign journalists have left, making it difficult to verify information. The country's collapsed healthcare system is ill-equipped to handle a disaster of this scale, compounding the tragedy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. products to zero, a significant potential development in the ongoing trade disputes between the two nations. Trump characterized the U.S.-India trade relationship as "one sided" and suggested the offer should have been made years ago. The claim comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been strengthening ties with China and Russia at the SCO summit, creating a complex diplomatic picture regarding India's international trade allegiances.

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during busy weekday morning and evening hours. The move, which follows a pilot scheme, is intended to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, expects the policy to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually but believes it is a worthwhile investment to support citizens financially and benefit the environment.</p>

          <p>Amid rising UK bond yields compared to the U.S., an analyst argues that the British government must take bold, eye-catching measures to avert a potential crisis of confidence in the gilts market. The article suggests that tinkering with policy will not suffice and calls for a credible autumn budget with tough fiscal decisions. Recommended actions include significant tax reform, such as a land tax to fund reductions in taxes on labor, and growth-enhancing policies like rejoining the EU customs union to change the negative market narrative.

This minimal change is the least in European Ryder Cup history, a deliberate strategy by Donald to prepare for the challenge of playing an away match at Bethpage Black in New York.</p>

This move is part of a broader U.S. strategy to curb China's technological development, which industry insiders believe will lead to a more fragmented global chipmaking industry and greater investment in domestic Chinese innovation.

          <p>As interest rates show signs of potentially falling, financial professionals advise that short-term certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer the best returns for savers. Terms around six months are identified as a "sweet spot," providing attractive APYs without locking up funds for an extended period. While longer-term CDs have historically yielded more, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts also suggest strategies like CD laddering or using no-penalty CDs to balance maximizing returns with the need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
