          <p>Eli Lilly has significantly raised its 2025 financial outlook after its second-quarter earnings surpassed analyst expectations, driven by massive sales of its diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion, attributing the growth to strong underlying business strength and high prescription volumes in the U.S. This positive forecast comes despite potential impacts from U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The strong performance highlights the company's dominant position in the rapidly expanding market for GLP-1 medications. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a large trade deficit that is significantly inflated by the country's gold refining industry. Although gold itself is exempt, its high value in trade statistics has distorted the overall economic picture, leading to punitive measures against other Swiss goods like watches and chocolate. Swiss officials argue that the value added by refining is minimal and that the industry's inclusion in trade data is misleading. The Swiss government is currently focused on relief measures for its businesses rather than retaliatory tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trade between China and Russia reached a 2025 peak of $19.14 billion in July, an 8.7% increase from June, though this figure represents a 2.8% decrease compared to the previous year. Chinese imports from Russia saw a modest year-on-year rise, but exports to Russia declined by nearly 9%. This trade activity occurs as Russia remains a primary crude oil supplier to China, although deliveries have recently fallen. The economic data is set against a backdrop of potential U.S. tariffs on countries importing Russian oil.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price declined after President Donald Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a post on Truth Social. Trump asserted that Tan is "highly CONFLICTED" without providing further details. The demand follows recent scrutiny from Senator Tom Cotton, who raised concerns about Tan's past investments and ties to Chinese companies, questioning the potential impact on U.S. national security. Tan was appointed CEO in March as the chipmaker navigated declining sales and initiated several cost-cutting measures, including slowing construction of a new Ohio factory.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell's recent transfer to a less-secure federal prison camp in Texas has fueled speculation that the move may be a reward for cooperation with the Department of Justice. The transfer occurred shortly after she met with a deputy attorney general, prompting legal experts to suggest she may have provided valuable information. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. The timing of the move, amid ongoing political focus on the Epstein case, has led to questions about whether it foreshadows further benefits for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>According to multiple reports, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to visit China later this month for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. This would be his first trip to the country in seven years and would facilitate a meeting with President Xi Jinping, signaling a potential thaw in relations. The diplomatic outreach comes as ties between the two Asian powers have steadily improved following a deadly 2020 border clash. This development also occurs while India's relationship with the United States is strained by escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Fred Walecki, the proprietor of the iconic Westwood Music shop in Los Angeles, who became a central figure and trusted confidant to a generation of rock musicians. From the 1960s onward, his store was more than a business; it was a clubhouse where artists like Jackson Browne, the Eagles, and Joni Mitchell gathered, connected, and found the perfect instruments. Walecki was known for his integrity, his knack for matchmaking musicians with the right gear, and his role as a supportive friend. He helped shape the California Sound by providing the tools and community that allowed the music to flourish.</p>

          <p>Israel's top security cabinet is set to meet to decide on a potential full military takeover of the Gaza Strip, a plan Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly sees as the only way to dismantle Hamas. The United Nations has warned that such a move would have "catastrophic consequences" for Palestinian civilians and could be disastrous for the remaining hostages. Reports indicate disagreement within the Israeli government, with military chiefs allegedly proposing an alternative plan to encircle Hamas strongholds rather than a complete occupation, which they fear could entrap Israeli troops.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly boosted by the strong performance of its film studios, which saw a 55% increase in revenue to $3.8 billion. This success was fueled by a string of box office hits, including "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1," which collectively grossed over $2 billion globally. CEO David Zaslav credited the turnaround to new leadership at the film division and a focus on major franchise releases. The company expects the momentum to continue, projecting at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the studios segment for the full year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% will have a mixed impact on UK households. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages are expected to see their monthly payments decrease, providing some financial relief. Conversely, savers will likely face lower returns on their deposits, as average savings rates are projected to continue their decline. This economic adjustment comes as the Bank forecasts inflation to rise to 4% by September, further eroding the real-term value of savings while aiming to support a slowing economy.

          <p>A vessel carrying around 200 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, sank while crossing the dangerous Bab al-Mandab Strait from Djibouti to Yemen, resulting in at least 92 deaths. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the so-called "Eastern Route," which thousands use annually to flee economic crisis and conflict in the Horn of Africa, hoping to reach wealthy Gulf states. The International Organization for Migration notes that the route is perilous due to rough seas, heavy maritime traffic, and the absence of official sea rescue operations, with smugglers often overloading small, unsafe boats.</p>
