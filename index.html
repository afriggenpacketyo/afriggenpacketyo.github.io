          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has admitted that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on United States defense spending, a long-standing accusation from Washington. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Europe understands it must now do more for its own security, especially in light of the threat from Russia. He emphasized that Germany is significantly increasing its defense budget and is working to strengthen a triangular alliance with the UK and France. Merz expressed confidence that he and President Trump are now "on the same page" regarding coordinating efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in over 1,500 protests across all 50 U.S. states to honor the legacy of civil rights leader John Lewis and demonstrate against the Trump administration. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, held on the fifth anniversary of Lewis's death, was organized by numerous advocacy and civil rights groups. Protesters voiced opposition to the administration's policies on civil rights, immigration, and social programs. The events, which included marches, vigils, and voter registration drives, aimed to channel Lewis's call for "good trouble, necessary trouble" to effect change.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, El Salvador's most prominent human rights organization, has announced it is shutting down its operations within the country due to escalating threats and harassment from President Nayib Bukele's government. The group, which will continue its work from neighboring countries, cited espionage, defamation campaigns, and the recent arrest of one of its leaders as making it unsafe to remain. Cristosal has been a vocal critic of Bukele's hardline anti-gang crackdown, which has led to mass incarcerations and widespread human rights concerns. Its departure is part of a larger exodus of journalists and activists from the nation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has directed the Attorney General to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, following pressure from his supporters. This move coincided with a Wall Street Journal report detailing a "bawdy" birthday note allegedly sent by Trump to Epstein in 2003, which included a crude drawing and a message about keeping "secrets." Trump has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, labeling it a "hoax" and threatening to sue the newspaper, its parent company News Corp, and Rupert Murdoch. The request to release court documents is seen as an attempt to manage the political fallout from the controversy.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Jon Rahm was visibly upset during the first round of The Open Championship, scolding a fan who he claimed whistled during his backswing on a difficult hole. After his shot went into the rough, Rahm turned to the gallery and criticized the timing of the noise. He later downplayed the incident to the media, acknowledging it was likely unintentional but noting the bad timing on a challenging, windy hole. Rahm admitted his own "bad swing" was also a factor and suggested he used the moment to release some of the tension he was feeling during the major tournament.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' efforts to pass a $9 billion spending cuts bill demanded by Donald Trump have been complicated by internal party tensions over the release of Jeffrey Epstein files.

The controversy intensified after the Justice Department stated no "client list" existed, frustrating many Trump supporters who believe in a cover-up.

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, a design that enhances its deployment flexibility. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, does not require a runway, making it suitable for remote or rugged terrain. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone recently demonstrated its advanced reconnaissance and autonomous operational capabilities in a drill. Its design allows for high-speed flight comparable to fixed-wing drones while retaining the vertical launch benefits of a quadcopter.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it canceled $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, brought by the state's attorney general, claims the administration's decision was "arbitrary and capricious" and politically motivated by President Trump's personal animus toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom characterized the move as a "political stunt" that threatens jobs in the Central Valley, where construction is underway.

The Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently from political pressure to maintain economic stability, and its chairs serve fixed terms.

The article argues that if improving public health were the true goal, the focus would be on reducing overall consumption of sugary drinks, which are a major contributor to obesity and diabetes.

Despite the slight cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates.

          <h2>Political Analyst Explores Reasons Behind Diane Abbott's Renewed Suspension from Labour Party</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party's decision to suspend MP Diane Abbott for a second time was largely unavoidable to maintain consistency, according to a BBC political analysis. The suspension follows a recent interview where Abbott stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension, in which she appeared to downplay the nature of antisemitism. Given Labour leader Keir Starmer's pledge to eradicate antisemitism from the party, her lack of regret for the original remarks left the leadership with little choice but to act. The situation underscores the party's ongoing sensitivity and strict stance on the issue.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, ending the franchise after more than three decades on the air. The network described the move as a "purely a financial decision" driven by the challenging advertising market and shifting viewer habits in late-night television. Colbert, who has hosted the top-rated late-night show for nine seasons, informed his audience of the decision, stating he was not being replaced and the entire show was "going away." The cancellation reflects a broader industry trend of audiences moving away from traditional broadcast television towards short-form digital content.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit stemmed from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, with shareholders alleging that officials failed to disclose risks and violated a 2012 FTC consent order. Investors were seeking to have the defendants reimburse Meta for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company incurred as a result of the scandal. Details of the settlement were not immediately made public when it was announced in a Delaware court, preempting testimony from Zuckerberg and other key figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are facing record-high prices for beef this summer, with the cost of ground beef and steaks reaching new peaks due to a persistently tight cattle supply. The U.S. cattle herd is at its lowest level since 1951, a result of long-term trends, multi-year droughts that increased feed costs, and ranchers selling off cattle for high profits. The situation is exacerbated by a halt on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs. Experts do not expect significant price relief soon, as rebuilding the herd would take several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Abbott Laboratories CEO Robert Ford stated that the significant drop in the company's stock price following its latest earnings report was an "overreaction" from investors. Although Abbott beat revenue and earnings expectations, its stock fell over 8% after the company tightened its full-year guidance. Ford attributed the cautious outlook primarily to a weaker-than-expected performance in its diagnostics business in China, while emphasizing that the fundamentals of the company remain strong. He highlighted double-digit growth in the medical devices division and a strong generic pharmaceuticals business in emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has avoided jail time in his 2024 DUI case by pleading no contest to a lesser charge of reckless driving. The former USC star was arrested after being found asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, Addison was sentenced to 12 months of probation, a fine, and must complete two online courses. While the legal matter is largely resolved, the NFL's substance abuse policy means he could still face a multi-game suspension from the league, with the incident remaining under review.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing mounting bipartisan pressure to release all Justice Department files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, a demand he has so far resisted. The controversy, fueled by conspiracy theories within his base and his own past association with Epstein, has become a significant issue for his administration. Democrats are capitalizing on the situation, while a recent poll shows the vast majority of Trump's own supporters want the files made public. Trump has dismissed these calls, labeling the matter a "hoax" and attacking supporters who are pushing for transparency.</p>
