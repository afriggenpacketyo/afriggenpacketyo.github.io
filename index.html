          <p>Serbian students, facing increasing pressure from authorities, have issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding snap elections and urging citizens to continue pushing for change. A major protest is scheduled for Saturday, a date of particular significance in Serbian history, as students demand political and criminal accountability for a tragic incident from the previous November. The government has intensified pressure on universities, withholding professors' salaries for the period of student blockades, while high school seniors face uncertainty regarding university entrance exams. Despite repression and consequences for student allies, protests continue, reflecting a strong desire for political change and justice. </p>

          <p>Chinese defense experts are expressing skepticism regarding claims that US strikes have completely destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities, citing reports that core components remain intact. CNN reported that a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment contradicted the claim that Iran's enrichment sites were "completely and totally obliterated." Chinese analysts suggest the strikes' effectiveness was limited due to factors such as the depth of Iran's underground facilities and potential removal of enriched uranium prior to the attacks. According to one expert, the Fordow facility is buried deeper than the penetration capabilities of the bombs used, suggesting the US may not have achieved its intended operational goal.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), as customers increasingly opt for cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's car sales in the European Union, Britain, and the European Free Trade Association fell by 27.9% year-on-year, totaling 13,863 units, resulting in a market share drop from 1.8% to 1.2%. This downward trend is partly attributed to brand and reputational damage and rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players like BYD. Despite this, Tesla's revamped Model Y compact SUV has shown promise in rebounding new car sales in Norway.</p>

          <p>After decades of rhetoric and 20 months of war, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory" following 12 days of strikes on Iran and a subsequent ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu, who has long advocated for attacking Iran's nuclear program, now asserts that the circumstances have aligned to make such action possible, even recruiting the U.S. to join in. The shift occurred after October 7, 2023, as threats from groups like Hamas and Hezbollah diminished, and Israel gained experience bombing Iran. Despite a spat with President Trump over the timing of attacks, Netanyahu boasts about striking Iran, a move that has bolstered his domestic political standing.</p>

          <p>Thomas Robinson, also known as Tam O' Braan, has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for defrauding luxury hotels and stores by selling them tea falsely advertised as "Scottish-grown."

Trading as The Wee Tea Plantation, Robinson claimed his tea was grown in Scotland, but it was actually bought from a wholesaler in Oxford and resold at inflated prices. His elaborate scam, which spanned five years, involved fabricating stories about his background and embellishing the credentials of his tea.</p>

This commitment is expected to add over $1 trillion a year toward common defense, which Trump hailed as a monumental win for the United States and for Europe, as it signifies a more equitable distribution of the financial burden.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities to be sealed off, with the resumption of the enrichment program dependent on the time it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs. The assessment also suggests that some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. While President Trump claimed the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," the DIA assessment provides a more cautious outlook, leading to conflicting statements and political backlash.</p>

While the judge acknowledged the city's breach of the agreement, he deemed receivership a last resort and ordered the selection of a third-party monitor to review the city's data on homeless housing and encampments. Attorneys for the city welcomed the ruling, while the alliance expressed satisfaction that the judge would continue to hold the city accountable.

          <p>Residents are expressing fear and distress due to escalating anti-social behavior from neighbors, including threats, property damage, and relentless noise. One family in South London recounts incidents involving a neighbor threatening them with a knife and damaging their property, leaving them feeling unsafe in their own home. Complaints about anti-social behavior have doubled in the past five years, with many feeling ignored by authorities. The housing ombudsman has found that social landlords often fail to protect tenants from such behavior, highlighting a need for better support and collaboration between agencies.</p>

          <p>Eurostar passengers are experiencing severe delays and cancellations after a cable theft near Lille, France, compounded disruptions from two separate fatalities on the railway track the previous day. The theft of approximately 600 meters of copper cables has caused trains to be rerouted, leading to extended journey times and cancellations. While repairs are complete and the railway line is open again, delays are expected to persist throughout the day, impacting services connecting London with Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam. Passengers are advised to postpone their journeys or seek refunds, as the situation remains chaotic at stations.</p>

          <p>The US Midwest is experiencing a severe heatwave, with residents seeking relief at splash pads and cooling centers as cities break daily high-temperature records. The situation is exacerbated by expanding suburbs of concrete and asphalt, which act as heat reservoirs, and by "corn sweat" in rural areas, which increases humidity. Experts note that warming global temperatures contribute to more severe and unstable weather patterns, with studies indicating the Midwest is particularly vulnerable to moist heat stress. This has led to increased heat-related deaths and growing concerns about the impact of climate change on agriculture and communities.</p>

Veterans are preparing to launch civil legal action against the MoD to gain access to their medical records, which they say are being illegally withheld.
