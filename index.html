            <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump privately admitted his tariff plans could trigger a recession but was more concerned about a potential depression. He reportedly told advisors he was willing to accept some economic "pain" from the policy. Bond yields had soared and equities plummeted before Trump partially reversed course, which was influenced by rising Treasury yields and the advice of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Trump also noted investor anxiety, saying people were getting "a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid" before the decision.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Air Force has announced that an F-35A fighter jet, nicknamed "Frankenjet," is now fully operational after being constructed from parts of two previously inoperative planes.

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields experienced a significant cooldown after President Trump announced a pause on tariffs, reversing a trend of bonds gaining ground as investors sought safer assets. The yield on the 2-year Treasury fell 14 basis points, while the 10-year yield dropped nearly 10 basis points. Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research suggested the bond market's reaction, particularly speculation about China selling U.S. assets, worried Trump more than the stock market sell-off due to its impact on mortgage rates.

            <p>The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4% for the 12 months ending in March, down from 2.8% in February, indicating a deceleration in inflation. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also fell to 2.8%, the lowest since March 2021. However, economists warn that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could reverse this trend, potentially pushing the U.S. inflation rate to around 4% by the end of 2025. While gasoline prices tumbled, grocery prices remain a trouble spot, with egg prices jumping significantly due to a bird flu outbreak.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade policy, which imposes a 125% tariff on goods imported from China, could significantly increase the cost of iPhones in the US. As much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China. Some analysts suggest that if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise substantially. Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains, with India emerging as a potential manufacturing hub.</p>

            <p>The BBC has learned that national leadership from the Unite union is holding up a deal between striking bin workers and Birmingham City Council. Sources suggest that local members were close to an agreement, but the involvement of national figures has stalled progress. Thousands of tonnes of rubbish have accumulated on the city's streets, leading to a major incident declaration. The union denies the claims and says it is defending workers from wage cuts.</p>

The judge also ruled on other evidentiary matters, including allowing the prosecution to present evidence of Kohberger's Amazon purchase history but not to use his "autism related characteristics" as an aggravating factor in the death penalty phase of the trial.</p>

The pause offers short-term relief but doesn't eliminate the threat of tariffs. Evercore analysts suggest macro weakness might benefit Affirm if traditional lenders tighten credit.

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% annually, signaling a slowdown in inflation, partly due to lower fuel prices. However, experts caution that President Trump's tariffs could increase inflation later in the year. Some economists believe that tariffs are a significant threat to the U.S. economy. The president's 90-day tariff pause excludes China, which will continue to face high tariffs, also likely to push up prices.</p>
