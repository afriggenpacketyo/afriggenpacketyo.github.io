          <p>A bride was killed and a 13-year-old child was wounded when masked gunmen opened fire at a wedding party in Goult, France. The attack occurred as the bride and groom were leaving the party, and one of the assailants was killed after being run over by the couple's car as they tried to escape. Approximately 100 police officers have launched a large-scale operation to find the remaining suspects. The Avignon prosecutor's office has opened an investigation for murder and attempted murder by an organized gang, suspecting the shooting may be related to a settling of scores. </p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law that restricts property ownership in the state by citizens of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The bill, which takes effect on September 1, allows individuals with valid US visas to purchase property only if it is used as a primary residence, effectively preventing nationals from these countries from buying investment properties. Abbott expressed support for the bill, stating that it would prohibit hostile foreign entities from purchasing land in Texas. Critics plan to file a lawsuit challenging the bill's constitutionality, setting up a potentially prolonged legal battle. </p>

          <p>An analysis discusses Donald Trump's decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites, calling it a decisive action against Iran's nuclear program. The article argues that a nuclear-armed Iran could have used a nuclear weapon against Israel, and Trump was right to use limited force while holding more in reserve. The author suggests that Iran is a weak state with penetrated security and hostile citizens, and its leaders do not want to confront the United States directly. The author concludes that the world is better off because of Trump's action. </p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is not at war with Iran but with Iran's nuclear program, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Vance stated that the strikes have substantially set back Iran's nuclear program, possibly for years, and that the administration will address the issue of Iran's highly enriched uranium. He asserted that the U.S. would respond with overwhelming force if Iran retaliates, but emphasized that Trump is not interested in a drawn-out conflict in the Middle East. The administration's objective is to eliminate the Iranian nuclear program, not to achieve regime change. </p>

          <p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's "supreme leader," was reportedly absent from potential negotiations with the United States in Turkey and remained in hiding during the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. President Donald Trump had been working with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan to coordinate high-level talks between U.S. and Iranian officials, but Khamenei was unreachable for approval. According to the New York Times, Khamenei is sheltering in a bunker and has suspended electronic communications. An Iran expert suggests that diplomacy with Iran was never viable and that Trump made the right decision to act with limited military strikes. </p>

Japan is monitoring the situation with grave concern, and a poll indicates that most Japanese citizens are worried about the impact of the Middle East war on their daily lives.

          <p>Senator Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that the United States must be prepared for Iran to retaliate following strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. He echoed President Trump's warning to Iran, stating that any targeting of Americans would be met with a response far greater than the strikes. While the full damage assessment is still underway, Cotton said that the strikes have severely damaged Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure.

          <p>This article details the US airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, with President Trump claiming they were "obliterated" and Israel stating they were in "full co-ordination" with the US. The US used B-2 stealth bombers and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators to target Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iran has confirmed the facilities were struck but denies it suffered a major blow, stating that the materials had already been taken out. The article also outlines potential Iranian responses, ranging from doing nothing to retaliating hard and fast or waiting to retaliate later. </p>

Himes noted that the impact of the attack was still being assessed and that such military involvements in the region often end in the worst-case scenario. He expressed concern that the strikes were undertaken without congressional approval, which holds the sole authority to declare war. Himes outlined the worst-case scenarios, including potential loss of American soldiers and the possibility that Iran had moved nuclear material to a different location. </p>

          <p>A group of Iranian businessmen, political and military figures, and relatives of high-ranking clerics had begun hatching a plan for running Iran without Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whether in the event of the 86-year-old leaderâ€™s death or of his being pushed aside. The plotters have agreed that a leadership committee consisting of a few high-ranking officials would take over running the country and negotiate a deal with the United States to stop the Israeli attacks. Some insiders want to sue for a deal with Trump, even if that means ditching Khamenei. Others believe that Iran must fight back, because otherwise it will invite further aggression. </p>

          <p>This analysis examines potential responses from Iran following US airstrikes on its nuclear sites, outlining three strategic courses of action: retaliate hard and soon, retaliate later, or not retaliate at all. Retaliating hard and soon could involve attacking US bases in the Middle East or launching swarm attacks on US Navy warships. Retaliating later would involve waiting until tensions subside before launching a surprise attack. The article also discusses potential economic targets, such as the Strait of Hormuz, and cyber warfare. The key consideration for Iran is the survival of the Islamic Republic regime. </p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's bombing of nuclear sites in Iran without congressional approval weakens American democracy. The author points out that bypassing Congress deprives citizens of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The article draws a comparison to the 2002 authorization of military force in Iraq, arguing that the congressional debate helped educate the public and allowed voters to hold members of Congress accountable. The author suggests that the trend of denying the public democratic channels to oppose war is dangerous and could lead to radicalization. </p>
