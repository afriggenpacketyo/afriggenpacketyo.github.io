            <p>Oscar Piastri emerged victorious at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a penalty for cutting a chicane while attempting to defend his lead at the first corner. Piastri, starting strong, capitalized on Verstappen's error and maintained a consistent lead throughout the race. George Russell finished third, while Leclerc secured a podium finish with an impressive first stint, ultimately overtaking Norris. The race saw an early safety car due to a collision between Tsunoda and Gasly, but no further interruptions occurred as Piastri secured the win.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza to an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders." The IDF claimed its troops believed they were facing a threat, citing poor visibility as a factor in misidentifying ambulances. The inquiry found that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim that is unsubstantiated by any evidence. A deputy commander has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report, and the incident occurred in what the IDF described as a hostile combat zone.</p>

            <p>Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a temporary surge in economic activity followed by a summer slowdown. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of higher import levies, potentially creating an "artificially high" level of activity in April. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook, provided the country navigates the tariff situation effectively, noting that pre-tariff data showed steady employment and declining inflation.</p>

While he enjoys strong support among Republicans, independents disapprove in high numbers, potentially indicating a trend towards unpopularity.
