          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. The proposed change, which would apply in England, Scotland, and Wales, has been praised by campaigners as a significant step in formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement.</p>

          <p>Singer Jessie J has announced that tests following surgery for an early-stage breast cancer diagnosis have shown the disease did not spread. The 37-year-old artist, who underwent a mastectomy in June, shared the news with her followers on social media, expressing her relief and gratitude for their support. She has been open about her experience, sharing a video of her young son offering encouragement before the operation.

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that any country aligning with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff. This warning came after the expanded BRICS alliance, which includes China and Russia, criticized US tariff policies and proposed reforms to global financial institutions. Trump has long been a critic of the bloc, which now represents over half the world's population. The threat adds another layer of complexity to ongoing global trade negotiations, as many nations find it difficult to shift supply chains away from dominant members like China.

          <p>A CNBC report, compiling analyses from various institutions and experts, explores the severe potential consequences of the spiraling U.S. national deficit. With the deficit exceeding 6% of GDP, prominent investors like Ray Dalio see classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, while national security experts warn of risks to defense spending. The report outlines three main areas of fallout: market instability, economic strain from inflation, and weakened international standing. Experts from the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate the U.S. has less than two decades to correct its fiscal course. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit is anticipated to yield minimal strategic progress, according to Italy’s ambassador to China, Massimo Ambrosetti. He expressed a pessimistic view, citing the complex context of ongoing tariff negotiations involving the EU, China, and the US as a major complicating factor. The summit, intended to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations, is expected to be overshadowed by disagreements over trade and the war in Ukraine. While dialogue is seen as valuable, the current climate suggests the meeting will likely result in statements of principle rather than substantive breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the nationwide Medicaid work requirement in President Trump's new legislative package is a flawed policy that will create immense bureaucratic burdens and harm vulnerable people. Most non-disabled Medicaid recipients are already working or are unable to, meaning the rule primarily functions as a work-reporting mandate. This will force millions of Americans to navigate complex, likely faulty systems to prove their eligibility, leading many to lose coverage due to red tape. The author contends the policy is designed to reduce enrollment through administrative hurdles rather than genuinely encouraging employment.</p>

It also establishes new tax breaks for income from tips, overtime pay, and auto loans. Additionally, the bill creates a new type of tax-advantaged savings account specifically for children, marking a substantial overhaul of the nation's financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 82 fatalities, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, catching communities by surprise and leading to over 160 air rescues. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the hardest-hit area, Kerr County, as search and recovery operations continue around the clock. Officials face scrutiny over the lack of advance warning for what they term a historic, catastrophic weather event.</p>

After the man fell through a snow bridge, he used a walkie-talkie to call for help, but rescuers were initially unable to find his location. The Air Zermatt helicopter team eventually spotted the tiny dog perched on a rock next to the nearly invisible hole where its owner had fallen. Rescue services credited the "four-legged hero" for its crucial role in saving the man's life.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid that resulted in the arrest of eight workers at a Vermont dairy farm has sent a wave of fear through the Northeast's agricultural industry. The raid, one of the largest in the state's history, comes amid mixed messages from the White House on worksite enforcement, creating uncertainty for an industry heavily reliant on immigrant labor. Four of the workers were quickly deported, while others remain in legal limbo. Advocates and workers argue that such enforcement tactics threaten to destabilize the dairy industry, which is a cornerstone of Vermont's economy and identity.</p>

The laws grant the government broad powers to intercept and surveil all electronic communications and move the national cybersecurity agency under the Office of the President.

The Fed's structure, which requires consensus among a 12-member committee to set interest rates, insulates it from direct presidential control. While Trump can appoint some governors over time, he cannot easily stack the committee or fire the chair without cause. Powell has publicly resisted political pressure, stating the Fed will not prematurely lower rates at the risk of raising inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critiques the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, closely associated with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for its lack of concrete policy proposals regarding sleep. While MAHA leaders emphasize diet and wellness, and acknowledge poor sleep's link to chronic disease, they have not outlined a legislative plan to address America's growing sleep deficit. The author suggests that while it is easy to identify health problems, the complexity of legislating better sleep habits illustrates a key challenge for the movement. Without a clear policy, the agenda risks appearing more like a self-help brand than a serious reform effort.</p>

Legal experts warn this expands an authority limited by the Supreme Court decades ago and could chill free speech among all naturalized citizens.
