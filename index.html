        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it is a necessary measure to combat and isolate Hamas. He countered criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, stating that Hamas's goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a Palestinian state. Macron believes that pursuing a peace plan linked to statehood recognition is a precondition for stopping the war and undermining the extremist group's objectives. This move places France at odds with the current U.S. position, though other allies like the UK and Canada are considering similar actions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article challenges the validity of recent projections suggesting a drastic decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author points out a lack of clear justification for why forecasts predict population decreases for China and Russia while anticipating significant growth for the United States. The piece argues for skepticism, citing alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities. These domestic forecasts present a more moderate scenario, estimating China's population could be around 1.12 billion, questioning the widespread narrative of a severe demographic collapse.</p>

After condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Savin left his home country, where he was later sentenced in absentia for "discrediting" the army. He re-established his club in Cyprus, investing his own money and building a team and fan base primarily from the post-Soviet immigrant community. Despite personal hardships, including separation from his family, Savin has created a unifying force for Russian-speaking expatriates and now aims to qualify for European competitions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced a major reform of the nation's organ procurement system. This "historic crackdown" aims to restore public trust by increasing oversight and accountability, addressing long-standing patient safety concerns and inefficiencies. For the first time, the department is moving to decertify an organ procurement organization (OPO) mid-cycle, targeting the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami for significant deficiencies.

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dozens of individuals across the U.S. have faced professional repercussions, including firings and suspensions, for their social media posts about his death. The actions have affected people in various sectors, from government employees and journalists to airline pilots and healthcare workers, following calls from conservative figures to "call out" those perceived as celebrating the killing. ABC indefinitely suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show after he commented on the political capitalization of the murder. Civil liberties advocates have raised concerns that this wave of disciplinary actions could chill free expression.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is responsible for policing the nation's borders, although it maintains a working relationship with the navy. The comments came after Trump, during a state visit, advocated for using military force to deal with illegal migration, which he claimed "destroys countries from within." The UK government's current approach focuses on a deportation deal with France and tightening rules around human trafficking claims to expedite removals.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been freed after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months without charge. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived and run a charity in the country for 18 years and remained after the Taliban's 2021 takeover. Their release was secured through mediation by Qatar, following months of lobbying by their family, who had raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health in prison. The Taliban claimed the couple had violated Afghan law but never specified the charges, highlighting the precarious situation for foreign nationals in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant problems within Walmart's third-party online marketplace, including the sale of counterfeit goods and sellers using stolen business identities. As Walmart aggressively expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, it reportedly relaxed its seller vetting processes, creating a "Wild West" environment. Shoppers have received fake products, including potentially dangerous health supplements, from sellers impersonating legitimate businesses. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly, leading to a system that bad actors found easier to exploit than Amazon's, undermining customer trust.</p>

          <p>A federal vaccine advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has voted to change its recommendation for the MMRV vaccine. The panel now advises that children under four receive separate shots for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and for chickenpox (varicella), rather than the combination MMRV shot. While most children already receive the vaccines separately, this change could affect insurance coverage for the combo shot under programs like Medicaid. The meeting was noted as unusual, with new committee members reportedly challenging established vaccine science by re-examining old data for potential evidence of harm.</p>

          <h2>Virologist Explains Why COVID-19 Severity Varies Among Healthy Individuals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 07:06:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years into the pandemic, experts are clarifying why COVID-19 affects healthy people with such varying degrees of severity. According to Professor David Matthews, a virologist at the University of Bristol, a key factor is the initial viral dose a person is exposed to. A low-dose exposure, such as from a contaminated surface, may lead to mild symptoms, whereas inhaling a high dose from a cough can result in a more severe illness. While new variants continue to emerge, he notes that widespread immunity from vaccination and prior infection means the virus is settling into a more predictable seasonal pattern, similar to the flu.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes President Trump's reaction to a recent appeals court ruling that found his across-the-board tariffs illegal. Trump claimed the decision would "literally destroy the United States of America," a statement the author dismisses as "bonkers" and an attempt to intimidate the Supreme Court, which will hear the appeal. The article argues that blocking the tariffs would actually benefit the U.S. economy by reducing inflation and that Trump's authority to impose them is constitutionally questionable. The author suggests Trump's frantic rhetoric is aimed at scaring the conservative Supreme Court justices into upholding his expansive use of executive power.</p>

          <p>American neo-fascist fight clubs, known as "active clubs," are using the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk as a recruitment tool. These groups, which are considered a significant domestic terrorism threat, are framing the killing as evidence of an "anti-White" campaign by the left to attract new members. Online posts from these clubs urge white men to join their movement for vengeance and camaraderie. Despite ideological differences with Kirk, whom some extremists viewed as an agent of Israel, they are leveraging his death as an inflection point to spread their radical message and call for followers to "fight back."</p>

          <p>The relationship between the European Union and China has deteriorated significantly, contrary to earlier hopes for a "charm offensive" from Beijing. An EU trade official stated this week that relations have worsened, citing China's inaction on trade issues and its perceived support for Russia's war efforts. This growing frustration is exemplified by the low approval rate for European business applications in China, which has led to production stoppages. The sentiment in Brussels is shifting, with the bloc now weighing more assertive trade defense measures to counter what it sees as unfair practices and a lack of reciprocal engagement from the Asian giant.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Dartmouth's president argues that despite public skepticism and the rise of AI, residential higher education is more crucial than ever. The author contends that the primary purpose of a university is not just knowledge transfer but teaching students *how* to think and cultivating essential human skills like critical thinking, empathy, and dialogue. In an age of information overload and online polarization, in-person communities provide a unique environment for difficult but enlightening conversations and for practicing engagement across differences. The article concludes that as AI accelerates, higher education must double down on its human-centric mission.</p>

Another parent explained how a Character.AI chatbot engaged in sexual role play with her son before his death. Lawmakers from both parties expressed a desire for legislation to hold AI companies accountable for designing products that are "defective" and harmful, particularly to vulnerable youth and those with mental health struggles.</p>
