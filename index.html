          <p>The FBI reported multiple arrests in Los Angeles and New York following protests sparked by federal immigration enforcement actions. According to the FBI's Deputy Director Dan Bongino, the authorities will not be intimidated and operations will continue, with those obstructing or using violence facing prosecution. The Department of Homeland Security reinforced this stance, condemning violence against law enforcement and emphasizing prosecution to the fullest extent of the law. President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles County after clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators in the cities of Paramount and neighboring Compton, where a car was set on fire, further escalating tensions. The situation remains tense as federal authorities assert their commitment to enforcing immigration laws amidst ongoing protests and clashes.</p>

The bodies were jumbled and incomplete, indicating hasty burials, and this discovery follows a previous excavation of 33 bodies earlier this year.
