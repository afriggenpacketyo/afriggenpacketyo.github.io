            <p>The U.S. Army is set to take control of nearly 110,000 acres of federal land along the U.S.-Mexico border in New Mexico for three years, aimed at curbing illegal immigration and trafficking, according to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. This transfer, prompted by President Trump's memorandum, allows the Army to increase patrols and build infrastructure to prevent border crossings. The move also intends to protect sensitive natural and cultural resources in the region, managed previously by the Bureau of Land Management, from environmental damage caused by illegal crossings. The department also said the Bureau of Land Management will work with the Army to ensure "some" uses will continue to support local grazing and mining.</p>

            <p>Nvidia announced it expects a $5.5 billion charge related to the U.S. government's new licensing requirement for exporting H20 graphics processing units to China. This restriction, effective indefinitely, is a significant blow to Nvidia's growth in the Chinese market, where the H20 chip, designed to comply with previous export controls, had generated substantial revenue. CEO Jensen Huang had previously noted a decline in revenue from China due to export controls, and this development further complicates Nvidia's position amid growing competition from Chinese companies like Huawei. The move also raised concerns about the stifling of competition and the potential erosion of U.S. competitiveness in technology.</p>

            <p>A federal judge rebuked Justice Department attorneys for their lack of action in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, ordering government officials to testify under oath. Judge Paula Xinis emphasized the Trump administration's obligation to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release and return to the U.S., criticizing their apparent failure to take any steps to aid in his release from the notorious Salvadoran prison. The judge scheduled expedited discovery and depositions to determine if the DOJ is complying with court orders. The Trump administration alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, but has provided little evidence of that assertion in court.</p>

            <p>Senator Chuck Grassley faced a barrage of criticism at a town hall in Iowa regarding the Trump administration's policies, including its refusal to comply with court orders to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. Constituents voiced concerns about the administration's tariffs and government overreach, questioning Grassley's role in providing checks and balances on the president. Grassley defended the administration, arguing that El Salvador's president's refusal to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court was the source of the issue, not President Trump. He also attempted to address concerns about the impact of tariffs on Iowa farmers, acknowledging potential benefits and drawbacks.</p>

This decision follows a lawsuit filed by AP after its exclusion from the press pool due to a dispute over the president's Gulf of Mexico name change.

            <p>United Airlines maintained its full-year forecast but took the unusual step of offering a second forecast contingent on a potential U.S. recession, citing the economy's unpredictability. The company warned that a recession could reduce profits this year, but noted that current booking trends remain stable. United plans to cut domestic flights starting this summer to align with weaker domestic travel demand, while international bookings remain strong. The airline expects to remain profitable regardless of the economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Maryland federal judge is demanding to know if the White House is actively working to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis has called for expedited discovery, including questioning government officials under oath, to determine if the government is doing enough to bring him back. Abrego Garcia was deported despite being granted protections by a U.S. immigration judge, and the Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return. The judge expressed concern about potential "bad faith" on the part of government officials.</p>

The action seeks to align Medicare payments for drugs with hospital costs and standardize patient payment rates across locations. It also directs the FDA to facilitate approval of state importation programs and streamline approval for lower-cost generics and biosimilars. The administration also aims to resurrect a program from Trump's first term to give insulin to low-income individuals.</p>

            <p>China's economic growth could be significantly impacted by rising US import tariffs, potentially dropping by as much as one percentage point this year. However, its increasingly strong trade ties with Southeast Asia could help offset the losses. The Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) predicts that China's reliance on the US market will hinder its growth if the tariffs remain in place. China's growing trade and investment relationships with Southeast Asia will be key in filling the void left by limited access to the US market.</p>

The trial is a major test of the FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech companies and could force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
