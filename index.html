Her rise to power comes as the ruling LDP faces declining popularity due to public dissatisfaction with living standards. She has pledged to rebuild the party and boost Japan's economic growth.</p>

          <p>Over the past year, Nike has implemented significant price increases across its core products, with footwear prices rising 17% and apparel by 14%. These hikes are a key component of new CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan, aimed at restoring the brand's pricing power and reducing excessive promotions. The strategy also coincides with external pressures from tariffs on goods manufactured in Asia, which the company expects to cost it $1.5 billion this fiscal year. Analysts are monitoring whether the brand can sustain these higher prices without losing consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, upholding her 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell's legal team had argued that a 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with federal prosecutors in Florida should have protected her from being charged. With the high court declining to hear her case, her legal avenues for overturning the conviction are nearly exhausted, leaving a potential presidential pardon as one of her few remaining hopes for an early release.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine has been awarded to scientists Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi for their groundbreaking discoveries related to immune tolerance. Their collective research led to the identification of regulatory T-cells and the critical role of the Foxp3 gene in controlling them. These cells act as guardians of the immune system, preventing it from attacking the body's own tissues and thereby averting autoimmune diseases. Their work has opened a new field of immunology and is pivotal for developing future treatments.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) are offering interest rates that can exceed the rate of inflation, providing a secure way for savers to grow their money. While national average rates remain low, online banks are offering highly competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), with some short-term CDs exceeding 4%. The market is currently experiencing an inverted yield curve, where shorter-term CDs (6-12 months) often provide higher returns than longer-term ones, a phenomenon savers can leverage through strategies like CD laddering.

          <p>While the U.S. government shutdown has furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delayed pay for many others, members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries. This is because congressional pay is guaranteed by the Constitution and funded by a permanent appropriation, meaning it is not subject to the annual funding battles that can lead to shutdowns. This disparity, where lawmakers continue to be paid while the federal employees they oversee face financial hardship, is often a source of public anger and criticism during funding impasses.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of 14 such funding lapses that have occurred since 1980, when a new legal interpretation prevented federal agencies from operating without congressional appropriations. Initially, shutdowns were typically short, lasting only a few days during the Reagan administration. However, in recent decades they have become more frequent and prolonged, evolving into a tool for high-stakes political battles, exemplified by the 21-day shutdown in 1995 over budget disputes and the record 34-day shutdown in 2018 over border wall funding.</p>
