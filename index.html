        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," offers her perspective on her unsuccessful presidential campaign, arguing that a more extended timeline and less internal friction from then-President Joe Biden's staff could have yielded a stronger challenge. She details three pivotal moments that defined those critical days: a distracting pre-debate phone call from Biden, her preference for Pete Buttigieg as a running mate over Josh Shapiro, whose expectations she found "unrealistic," and her widely criticized "The View" gaffe where she struggled to articulate policy differences with Biden. The article highlights the complex internal dynamics and external pressures that shaped her political journey.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison after nearly six years, reuniting with his family following a pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. A prominent pro-democracy blogger, Abdel Fattah was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news" for a post about prisoner torture. His release, reportedly requested by the National Council for Human Rights, came after significant international advocacy and an extensive hunger strike by his mother. This event, while a cause for joy, occurs within a broader context of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Egypt, as highlighted by human rights groups.</p>

          <p>Europe faces an increasingly complex foreign policy landscape, having lost its traditional alignment with the U.S. and struggling to define its stance on China. Historically, Europe's China policy mirrored Washington's, viewing Beijing primarily through an economic lens until U.S.-China tensions escalated. Now, with an unpredictable U.S. administration, Europe grapples with economic security, trade protectionism, and its reliance on Chinese green technology. The article highlights two core dilemmas: the rise of illiberal forces in Europe, inspired by China's authoritarian success, and Beijing's practical alignment with Russia, complicating Europe's security interests, particularly regarding the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>China is actively pursuing the development of a unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from traditional Western frameworks, according to Zheng Yongnian of Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. This initiative aims to more effectively explain China’s foreign policy and its evolving global role, emphasizing intellectual autonomy as a strategic component of Beijing’s increasing international influence. The push aligns with China’s Global Governance Initiative, which advocates for a multipolar and inclusive global order centered on sovereign equality and multilateral cooperation.

          <p>Blackstone, a prominent private equity firm and owner of Jersey Mike's, has expanded its portfolio by acquiring Tropical Smoothie Cafe, a fast-casual franchise known for its healthy blends and meals. This acquisition reflects a broader trend of large investment firms capitalizing on the growth potential of restaurant chains. While such investments can drive expansion, the article cautions that they also carry risks, citing Red Lobster's bankruptcy as an example where investor actions led to financial distress rather than brand prosperity.

This strategic shift by Porsche and its parent Volkswagen highlights the considerable challenges European manufacturers face in balancing electrification targets with market realities and fierce global competition.

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's historic New Forest for the annual pannage season, an ancient tradition dating back to 1079. This practice is crucial for the forest's ecology, as the pigs consume acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to other free-roaming animals like ponies and cattle. The verderers, who manage the land, initiated pannage due to a particularly "heavy acorn crop." While celebrating this unique form of environmental stewardship, officials urge visitors to maintain a safe distance from the pigs and drive with extreme caution through the forest to prevent accidents.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a significant increase from previous costs, effective immediately. This one-time payment, aimed at encouraging companies to hire American workers, applies to new applicants but not renewals or current visa holders. H-1B visas allow skilled foreign professionals, particularly in STEM fields, to work in the U.S. when domestic talent is scarce. The tech industry, heavily reliant on these visas, is scrambling to understand the implications, while economists warn of potential weaker economic growth and a "brain drain" of skilled international graduates.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a recommendation for pregnant women to limit Tylenol use, citing a potential link to autism, a claim that contradicts established medical evidence. President Trump directly advised women, "Don't take Tylenol," based on his "common sense." However, the FDA's subsequent note to physicians was more measured, stating no causal relationship has been established and the association remains an area of scientific debate. Major medical groups, including ACOG, strongly criticized the announcement as "irresponsible" and "dangerously simplifies" complex causes of neurodevelopmental issues, emphasizing Tylenol's safety as a painkiller during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced 10 new astronaut candidates, comprising four men and six women, selected from over 8,000 applicants to train for future missions to the International Space Station, the moon, and eventually Mars. This class marks NASA's first with more women than men, including Anna Menon, who previously flew on a commercial SpaceX mission. The new astronauts join at a time of uncertainty due to Trump administration budget cuts and the planned ISS retirement. Despite challenges, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy expressed confidence in beating China back to the moon, emphasizing the ambition of the space program.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially designating Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," directing federal officials to investigate and disrupt its alleged "illegal operations." This action follows Trump's earlier threats to label the decentralized group, despite authorities not linking Antifa to the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk. Legal experts question the order's practical impact, as U.S. law lacks a mechanism for designating domestic terrorist groups or charging individuals with domestic terrorism. The White House cited Antifa's "long history of terrorizing our communities," while critics emphasize its fluid nature and the potential for chilling free speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, as major health agencies move to phase out live animal research. This shift, driven by an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan lawmakers, aims to reduce the estimated $20 billion annually spent on animal experiments. While animal tests have been crucial for developing many life-saving drugs and vaccines, new alternatives like AI-based modeling and human organ lab testing are being explored. The article highlights the ethical debate, the impact on ongoing research for rare diseases, and the scientific community's cautious approach to fully replacing animal models.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of President Trump, allowing him to dismiss Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission. The court also agreed to revisit a 1935 precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which has long shielded independent agencies from presidential interference, limiting removals to misconduct or neglect of duty. Justice Elena Kagan, in dissent, warned this ruling could grant the president full control over agencies intended to be bipartisan and independent. The decision has significant implications for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, affecting the autonomy of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

Pierson was reportedly attempting the Palisades Traverse, a formidable 20-mile mountaineering route that crosses five peaks exceeding 14,000 feet and involves navigating the Palisades Glacier. The Inyo County Sheriff’s Office and Search and Rescue teams have conducted extensive operations around Temple Crag without locating him.

Activists argue domestic legal avenues have failed, as the Supreme Court lifted bans on "roving patrols."
