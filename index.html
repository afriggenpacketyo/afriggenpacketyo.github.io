          <p>Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title by defeating American Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon women's final. The match was remarkably one-sided, with Swiatek winning 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes, marking the first time in 114 years a player failed to win a single game in the women's final. For the 24-year-old Swiatek, this victory adds a grass-court major to her previous wins on clay and hard courts. The final was a significant milestone for Anisimova as well, being her first Grand Slam final appearance after returning from a career break.</p>

          <p>A team of over 30 active duty and former Navy SEALs is assisting in search and recovery operations in Texas Hill Country following devastating floods. Leveraging their expertise in difficult terrain and diving, the volunteers are navigating the debris-strewn Guadalupe River to locate victims and provide closure for families. The SEALs, working with the non-profit 300 Justice Road, described the destruction as unprecedented and emotionally taxing, particularly when discovering children's belongings from a nearby camp. Their efforts are part of a wider community response to the disaster, which has claimed numerous lives.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Revoking Rosie O'Donnell's Citizenship Amid Escalating Feud</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 23:09:41 EDT</div>

          <p>The long-standing feud between Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell has intensified, with Trump suggesting he is considering revoking the comedian's U.S. citizenship. In a social media post, he labeled O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, a "Threat to Humanity." O'Donnell responded sharply, calling Trump a "criminal con man" and a "danger to our nation," highlighting their 18-year history of public animosity. Legal experts note that unilaterally revoking the citizenship of a natural-born citizen is constitutionally prohibited, making the threat largely symbolic but indicative of the deep-seated political and personal conflict.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" investigation details the 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden, whose body was discovered on Florida's Gulf Coast, leading detectives to a bloody motel room. The case uncovered her involvement in a volatile three-person relationship, or "throuple," with Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. The investigation revealed a history of alcohol-fueled violence, jealousy, and control within the trio, culminating in a brutal beating in their shared motel room. Ultimately, Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison for his role in Seiden's death.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities arrested 319 people in raids on two licensed cannabis farms in Southern California, an operation that resulted in protests and one farm worker's death. The worker died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during one of the raids, according to a family member and DHS. The raids, based on criminal warrants for harboring and employing undocumented immigrants, led to a tense standoff between agents and community members in Camarillo. The incident has heightened fear in immigrant communities and prompted a federal judge to temporarily halt such raids in the region.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department and FBI are facing internal and external backlash after deciding not to release more records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating a much-hyped "client list" never existed.

Trump publicly defended Bondi, urging his base to unify and dismiss the focus on Epstein, whom he called "somebody that nobody cares about."

This process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese without any animal involvement. While proponents highlight the environmental benefits and potential for better taste than current vegan options, they face significant hurdles, including regulatory approval, high initial costs, and declining sales in the broader plant-based market.

          <p>A wildfire near Grand Canyon National Park has exploded in size, scorching over 20,000 acres and forcing evacuations, as another nearby fire threatens historic structures. The rapid growth of the White Sage Fire is occurring amid an intensifying wildfire season that is also seeing smoke from Canadian wildfires drift across the U.S. This has resulted in unhealthy air quality alerts for much of the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota. All of Manitoba, Canada, is under a state of emergency, with thousands evacuated as fires there burn a record amount of land.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas killed at least 129 people over a holiday weekend, with dozens still missing. The disaster, which heavily impacted a summer camp, was caused by a massive, slow-moving weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone region. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of warnings and evacuations, with some survivors stating they received no alert before the deluge. As a massive search and recovery effort continues, discussions have emerged about the need for a more robust, state-funded flood warning system to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, was beaten to death in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to his family. The incident reportedly occurred on Friday when Musallet was visiting family and confronted settlers while protecting his family's land in the town of Sinjil. His family alleges that settlers surrounded him for hours, preventing paramedics from reaching him, and they are demanding a U.S.-led investigation. The State Department has confirmed the death of a U.S. citizen and is providing consular assistance, while referring investigative questions to Israeli authorities amid ongoing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Investigators have begun a two-year excavation at the site of a former church-run children's home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of hundreds of babies and toddlers. The St Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, with death records showing 796 children died there. The grave's existence was uncovered by an amateur historian in 2014, and a 2017 test dig confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The full excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a painful chapter of Irish history to light.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from both the European Union and Mexico, with the new duties set to take effect on August 1. In letters posted to social media, Trump cited the need to address large trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb narco-trafficking. The move represents a significant escalation of his administration's protectionist trade policies, threatening to disrupt global supply chains and provoke retaliatory measures from two of America's largest trading partners. The EU stated it would take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from conducting "indiscriminate" arrests of individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit alleging that federal agents were unconstitutionally profiling people based on race, ethnicity, or location without reasonable suspicion. The order specifically prohibits arrests based solely on speaking Spanish or being present at certain locations like bus stops. This legal setback comes amid the administration's intensified immigration enforcement efforts, particularly in California, which have sparked widespread protests.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting a positive tone for the Los Angeles Dodgers as they snapped a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. In his return to the mound after Tommy John surgery, Ohtani pitched three scoreless innings, allowing only one hit while striking out four. Although bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the struggling team needed. His performance is an encouraging sign of his potential as an elite starting pitcher as he continues to build up his workload.</p>

In the final moments, a crucial break by Guy Pepper set up his fellow replacement van Poortvliet for the decisive score. The series win is a significant achievement for coach Steve Borthwick's side, which was missing numerous key players and faced a strong Argentinian team in their home territory.</p>
