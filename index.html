          <h2>Trump Administration Eases Some Automotive Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 17:19:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some automotive tariffs, aiming to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports resulting from levies on steel and aluminum. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will continue, the order provides partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for vehicles assembled in the U.S. for two years. The reimbursement offsets could equal 3.75% of a U.S.-made car's value assembled before May 1, 2026, and 2.5% until April 30, 2027. The administration claims these measures will help automakers during the 'little transition,' retroactively applying to tariffs from April 3.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties impacting advertising demand. CEO Evan Spiegel noted headwinds at the start of the current quarter, leading to a cautious approach to investment. The company expects daily active users to be around 468 million and lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses. Snap's first-quarter sales rose 14% to $1.36 billion, with a net loss of $140 million, which they attributed to restructuring charges.</p>

          <p>A study comparing life expectancy for individuals born between 1900 and 2000 reveals minimal changes in many southern states, particularly for women, while northeastern and western states show significant improvements. West Virginia had the lowest increase for women, with life expectancy rising by only one year. Conversely, New York showed substantial gains, with women expected to live two decades longer. Researchers attribute these regional discrepancies to variations in state public health policies, tobacco regulations, vaccine policies, and socioeconomic factors, highlighting the impact of state-level decisions on longevity.</p>

          <p>UPS plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting effort linked to delivering fewer packages for Amazon, its largest customer. The layoffs, impacting over 4% of its workforce, are part of a plan to consolidate facilities and potentially close additional buildings. Despite this move, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs, according to the Teamsters general president. UPS expects to save $3.5 billion this year through consolidation, while Amazon claims it offered to increase UPS's volumes before the delivery company decided to reduce shipments.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens of the New York Times interviews Dane Chapin, a business owner who voted for Trump in the last election, about his concerns regarding the administration's trade policies. Chapin's company, USAopoly, relies on manufacturing in China to keep prices affordable, and the recent tariffs threaten to obliterate the toy business. He notes that while Apple receives tariff exceptions, smaller businesses like his are left in deep peril. Despite these concerns, Chapin doesn't regret his vote, seeing Trump as the better option compared to the Democratic alternative, but he does regret the current trade policy.</p>

However, success rates vary based on the debt, creditors, and the debt settlement provider chosen. Preparing with a clear understanding of your financial situation and explaining your hardship can improve the chances of a successful debt settlement. (not investment advice)</p>
