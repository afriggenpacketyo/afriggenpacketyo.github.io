          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested 890 individuals at a demonstration protesting the UK government's ban on the group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for showing support for a proscribed organization, with a smaller number for offenses including violent disorder and assaults on police officers. The government banned Palestine Action in July after activists damaged military aircraft at an RAF base, making support for the group a criminal offense. Protest organizers, Defend Our Juries, condemned the police response as violent and described the ban as unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will step down, succumbing to mounting pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party. The decision follows a significant defeat in the July parliamentary election, where his ruling coalition lost its majority in the upper house, compounding an earlier loss in the lower house. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to resign, citing the need for political stability amidst economic challenges and regional tensions. However, facing a virtual no-confidence vote, his resignation paves the way for a party leadership election in early October to select his successor.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first win as head coach for the University of North Carolina, leading the Tar Heels to a 20-3 victory over Charlotte. The game followed an embarrassing season-opening loss and showed signs of improvement for the team. Following the win, Belichick addressed reports about his relationship with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC facilities. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome at his, highlighting the deteriorated relationship since his departure in 2024.</p>

          <p>London is experiencing its first major Tube strike since March 2023, as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union begin a five-day walkout. The rolling industrial action is centered on disputes over pay and "fatigue management," with the union demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but deemed the reduced work week proposal unaffordable. The strike is causing significant disruption, with little to no service expected on most lines from Monday to Thursday, impacting commuters and forcing the rescheduling of major events like Post Malone concerts.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Increased Coal Power Serves as a Shock Absorber for Renewables Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China's recent expansion of coal power capacity, while seemingly a setback for climate goals, is a pragmatic strategy to support its massive transition to renewable energy. The country added a record 212GW of solar capacity in the first half of the year, leading to increased power curtailment where generated clean energy cannot be used. Simultaneously, droughts have reduced hydropower output.

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask television partners to refrain from broadcasting any crowd disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. This move is seen by critics as a hypocritical and cowardly act of censorship, especially given the tournament's history of televising other disturbances, such as climate protests. The directive sacrifices the event's authentic and unfiltered New York atmosphere to shield a political figure from public disapproval. This contrasts sharply with the USTA's brand of championing diversity and breaking barriers, making the decision appear as a capitulation to political pressure.</p>

          <p>The second-hand fashion app Vinted, now a billion-dollar company, originated from a simple problem faced by its co-founder, Milda Mitkutė, in 2008: she had too many clothes for her new, smaller apartment. After discussing the idea of selling her unwanted items online with friend Justas Janauskas at a party, they quickly launched a basic website. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a "buy" button, the platform's popularity grew through word of mouth, expanding from Lithuania to Germany and beyond. Vinted overcame a major crisis in 2016 after a failed attempt to introduce seller fees, eventually becoming Lithuania's first tech unicorn by focusing on a user-friendly, fee-free model for sellers.</p>

One of the prominent targets was the cabinet building in Kyiv's historic government district, which sustained damage to its roof and upper floors.

          <p>A recent study of sauropod fossils from Brazil reveals that these giant, long-necked dinosaurs were afflicted with osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection, approximately 80 million years ago. Researchers analyzed the skeletons of six individuals from the same paleontological site and found lesions indicative of the disease, which is caused by pathogens like bacteria or fungi. The fossils showed no signs of healing, suggesting the infections were active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor. The findings indicate that the ancient swampy environment of the region likely provided ideal conditions for pathogens to thrive and infect multiple dinosaurs.</p>

Sources indicate Prince has been in Kyiv, pitching his services and attempting to acquire Ukrainian drone manufacturing companies, which are now considered strategic national assets. This move comes amid discussions in the Trump administration about using private contractors in a postwar Ukraine. Prince's interest is seen as opportunistic, following a pattern of seeking profit from conflict zones with valuable natural resources, though his reputation has made some in the industry consider him "universally untouchable."</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is actively promoting Christian prayer in public schools, specifically encouraging students to recite the Lord's Prayer. This comes as a new state law allows schools to set aside time for prayer and reading religious texts, a move critics argue violates the constitutional separation of church and state. Paxton's stance is contrasted with his past actions in 2017, when he raised concerns about a classroom being used by Muslim students for prayer, suggesting it excluded other faiths. This apparent double standard aligns with a broader Christian nationalist agenda that seeks to prioritize one religion within public institutions, raising alarm among civil liberties and interfaith groups.</p>

Pulte accused Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on loan applications, an allegation her lawyers call a "clerical error."

The parasite, which lays eggs in open wounds of warm-blooded animals, can decimate livestock herds and has already caused over a billion dollars in losses to Mexico's cattle industry.

Rayner's exit, prompted by a stamp duty controversy, has triggered a major government reshuffle and a contest for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party. Burnham suggested the deputy leadership race is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a successor from the north of England to counter a "London centricity."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis argues that President Donald Trump's economic policies increasingly resemble the Peronist model that historically damaged Argentina's economy. This approach includes "import substitution" via high tariffs, personal dealmaking where the president decides corporate winners and losers, and exerting significant government control over private companies, such as taking equity stakes in firms like Intel and U.S. Steel. Furthermore, Trump's attempts to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence and his use of emergency powers to unilaterally impose trade policies echo Juan Perón's methods. This shift away from market capitalism towards a centralized, personality-driven economic model risks entrenching cronyism and creating long-term instability in the U.S. economy.</p>

While the IRS imposes a federal tax of about 37%, some states levy additional income taxes that can exceed 10%, while others charge none at all. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to maximize their prize. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This breakdown underscores the considerable financial advantage for jackpot winners residing in states without a lottery tax.</p>

After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his Indian Premier League commitments, he lost his place in the Test XI and served as a spare batter for four matches against India. Bethell acknowledged the lack of playing time but suggested the break might have been beneficial ahead of a busy upcoming cricket schedule.</p>

          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took charge of Starbucks and pledged constructive engagement, the company and the Starbucks Workers United union are still at a standstill over a first contract. Despite over 12,000 workers unionizing at nearly 650 stores, progress on negotiations has stalled under Niccol's leadership. Workers criticize his "Back to Starbucks" strategy for increasing demands without improving pay or staffing, with 91% of surveyed employees reporting understaffing issues. The union continues to grow and is planning further actions to pressure the company, highlighting the vast disparity between Niccol's $97.8 million compensation and the median worker's salary.</p>

          <p>Despite public commitments from Donald Trump and the Justice Department to fully investigate Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, lawyers representing approximately 50 of his survivors say they have not been contacted by federal investigators. This lack of outreach casts serious doubt on the administration's dedication to transparency and uncovering the full extent of Epstein's network. Attorneys for the survivors find the silence appalling, especially contrasting it with the deputy attorney general's lengthy interview with convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. The failure to engage with victims suggests the government's efforts may be more focused on political damage control than achieving justice for the survivors.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are utilizing deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in one of these statuses. Deferments are often preferable, as the government may cover the interest on subsidized loans, particularly in cases of economic hardship or unemployment. Forbearances are more accessible but typically result in interest accumulation, which can significantly increase the total debt over time. While these tools can prevent default, experts advise they are short-term solutions and encourage borrowers to explore income-driven repayment plans for more sustainable, long-term affordability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proliferation of advanced surveillance technologies, from satellite imagery and camera traps to home security cameras and drones, is making it increasingly difficult for animals to remain unseen. This constant monitoring raises philosophical and ethical questions about whether animals have a right to privacy. Some philosophers argue they do, pointing to behaviors like seeking seclusion or altering communication to avoid being overheard, suggesting an interest in controlling their social exposure. While surveillance can aid conservation, it can also lead to harm, such as disturbing nesting birds or enabling poaching. The issue is particularly acute for pets, who are subject to constant human control over their space and intimacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's aggressive deportation campaign, combined with historically low U.S. birth rates, could cause the nation's population to shrink for the first time on record in 2025. With natural increase (births minus deaths) at a low of about 500,000, a significant decline in net immigration could tip the balance into negative growth. This demographic shift poses serious economic risks, as immigrants are crucial to key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare. A shrinking workforce could lead to labor shortages, higher prices for consumers, and a strain on services for an aging population, potentially pulling forward a national decline that demographers didn't expect for decades.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a widespread and often asymptomatic condition known as the "silent killer," affecting over half of Americans by age 40. New American Heart Association guidelines recommend initiating treatment once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg to prevent severe health issues like heart disease, stroke, and dementia. For initial stages, lifestyle changes such as a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction are advised. For higher readings (140/90 or above), starting with two types of medication is recommended, as evidence shows this is more effective for lowering blood pressure into a healthy range.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of more military and other non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of the Labour government's strategy to accelerate the process of moving people out of hotels, which have become costly and a source of public tension. The new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is expected to announce formal proposals soon. While the government has already been using two former military bases for this purpose, this expansion signals a broader, cross-departmental effort to manage the rising number of asylum seekers and the associated accommodation costs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term is marked by a chaotic and systematic assault on the established norms of U.S. economic policy, creating a model that is increasingly unrecognizable. His interventions range from imposing high tariffs and taking government equity stakes in major tech companies like Intel to attempting to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and firing heads of labor and statistics agencies. This approach combines deregulation with direct state control, smashing the post-2008 "Washington consensus" of free-market capitalism. While the AI-fueled stock market has so far remained buoyant, the radical uncertainty created by Trump's unpredictable policies poses significant long-term risks to economic credibility and stability.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the concept of "security theatre" in Donald Trump's immigration policies, exemplified by the controversially named "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center in a Florida swamp. The facility, which has faced legal challenges over environmental rules, serves as a powerful symbol of a tough-on-immigration stance, regardless of its practical effectiveness or legality. This approach prioritizes visible, often harsh, displays of enforcement to project an image of control and deterrence. The sinister branding and location of such facilities are key components of this strategy, designed to resonate with a political base and create a spectacle of security.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have continued their record-breaking surge, gaining approximately 35% this year to reach nearly $3,600 an ounce, attracting significant investor attention. Analysts attribute the rally to gold's status as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tension, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. For those looking to invest, most financial experts recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), citing their liquidity and cost-effectiveness over physical bullion. Despite the strong performance, advisors typically suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
