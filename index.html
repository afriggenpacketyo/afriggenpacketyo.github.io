          <h2>US Inflation Report Released Amidst Trump-Fed Disagreement on Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:38:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent inflation report indicated a 2.7% annual rise in June, marking an acceleration from the previous month but staying below the 3% rate recorded when President Trump took office. This report surfaces amid a notable disagreement between Trump and the Federal Reserve regarding the potential inflationary impact of tariffs. While Trump confidently declares inflation "dead" and the economy "roaring," the Fed, along with numerous economists and major retailers, forecasts a rekindling of price increases due to his levies. The central bank has maintained steady interest rates, assessing the fluctuating policy's effects, a posture that has drawn sharp criticism from the president who believes he could manage the Fed better.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing grants of up to £3,750 to reduce the cost of new electric cars, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles. These discounts, part of a £650 million scheme, apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000, with more environmentally friendly models receiving larger reductions. While the initiative is welcomed by some carmakers, critics highlight the persistent need for significantly more public charging points, especially for households without driveways. The policy seeks to make zero-emission cars more affordable and support the automotive sector, despite concerns from some political figures about forcing families into more expensive vehicles.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts aboard a SpaceX capsule successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, concluding Axiom Space's 20-day private Ax-4 mission to the International Space Station. The pre-dawn return included a sonic boom that rattled parts of southern California. This mission marked several milestones, including the maiden voyage of SpaceX's newest capsule, Grace, and extended Commander Peggy Whitson's record for cumulative time in space by a U.S. astronaut. The crew, which included astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, conducted approximately 60 scientific experiments, making it the most research-intensive Axiom Space flight to date.</p>

The move reflects Hong Kong's broader strategy to embrace digital assets and attract global investors, as traditional financial institutions increasingly engage with the crypto industry.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested he could officially change the U.S. term "soccer" to "football," aligning the country with global nomenclature for the sport. Speaking to DAZN TV during the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, Trump, who was present at the match, jokingly entertained the idea of an executive order for the renaming. While "football" is widely used internationally, the U.S., Canada, and Australia commonly refer to the game as "soccer." This comment, made as the U.S. hosted a newly expanded global tournament, underscores Trump's increasing engagement with what the British call "the Beautiful Game" and its cultural terminology.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially debuted its Model Y electric SUV in India, with an initial price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other major markets like the U.S. This launch coincides with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai, with another planned for New Delhi. The high pricing is attributed to India's substantial import tariffs and luxury taxes on EVs, positioning the Model Y as a premium competitor against brands like BMW rather than mass-market local EVs. Experts suggest Tesla is primarily "testing the waters" in India, focusing on early adopters and strategic soft power moves rather than immediate large-scale sales or local manufacturing commitments.</p>

          <p>The Alger family in Augusta, Georgia, devout Roman Catholics with eight children and another on the way, choose home births due to a deep distrust of hospitals and the medical system. Their skepticism, partly fueled by vaccine concerns and Georgia's high maternal mortality rate, aligns with a broader national decline in trust in medical institutions. While data shows hospitals are safer, the Algers prioritize avoiding interventions and seek more control over the birth process, even using an out-of-state licensed midwife. This trend highlights a societal shift and advocates' calls for increased federal support for diverse maternal health options, including safer home birth frameworks.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins, a rapidly growing segment in cryptocurrency, are garnering significant attention from major companies like Amazon and Walmart, and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase. Designed to be stable by being backed one-to-one with reserves like the U.S. dollar, they offer the promise of instantaneous, borderless money transfers, circumventing traditional banking fees and delays. While Congress is on the verge of adopting legislation to regulate them, critics raise concerns about their safety, potential for illicit use by actors like drug dealers, and the risk of "runs on the bank" that could impact the financial system.

The EU has imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs and demands reciprocal market access, while China accuses the EU of protectionism.

Analysis shows the team has diversified its goal scorers and adapted its attacking focus, particularly utilizing Lauren James on the right flank. While conceding more goals than in 2022, the defense has improved after a tough opener against a higher-ranked opponent.

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that the country did not violate international law by failing to prevent or strictly monitor U.S. drone attacks in Yemen that utilized signals from the Ramstein air base. The case was brought by two Yemenis whose family members were killed in a 2012 drone strike. While acknowledging Germany's obligation to protect human rights abroad, the court found insufficient evidence that the U.S. used unjustifiable criteria for targets or that the attack had a strong enough connection to German state authority. The ruling concludes a decade-long legal battle, despite arguments that Ramstein is crucial for U.S. combat drone operations in Yemen.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino remains ambitious for the Club World Cup, despite past criticisms, with discussions ongoing about expanding the tournament to 48 teams in 2029 and even staging it more frequently. The recent tournament's $1 billion prize fund, which saw Chelsea bank £85 million, has spurred interest from top clubs. Real Madrid, a major commercial success for the event, has even suggested a biennial format. While FIFA has no immediate plans for a two-year cycle, the prospect of a larger tournament and new host nations is actively being considered, reflecting Infantino's drive to further globalize and commercialize club football.</p>
