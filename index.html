          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has called for the Trump administration to impeach "corrupt judges," a sentiment echoed by prominent MAGA figures. This call comes amid a significant increase in threats against U.S. federal and local judges, which experts attribute to rhetoric from senior administration officials. Critics argue these tactics mirror those used by authoritarian leaders globally to undermine judicial independence and subvert democratic accountability by intimidating judges into ruling in favor of the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, a Ron DeSantis appointee, is leading an initiative to audit and expose alleged wasteful spending in Democratic-run cities and counties in Florida. However, the effort is facing criticism for being politically motivated and for employing intimidating tactics, such as sending armed police to the home of a retired veteran who sent a non-threatening postcard. Officials in targeted areas like Broward County are also pushing back, claiming Ingoglia's calculations of "wasteful spending" are based on inaccurate data and ignore state-mandated costs.</p>

          <p>The article explores the security differences between using a wired Ethernet connection and wireless Wi-Fi for home internet. While Ethernet is inherently more secure due to its physical nature, which makes data interception difficult, a well-configured Wi-Fi network with strong passwords and modern WPA3 encryption can be very safe. Ultimately, overall network security depends more on user practices like updating router firmware, using antivirus software, and managing connected devices than on the connection type alone.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan announced that its forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border. The clashes represent a significant escalation in tensions, which Afghanistan attributes to repeated violations of its territory by Pakistan, including recent bombings. Pakistan has not confirmed the casualties and accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul denies, leading to the closure of key border crossings and raising regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, planning to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports starting next month. This new tariff will be added to the existing 30% duties, bringing the total to 130%. The move is a direct response to China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, which are critical for numerous high-tech and defense industries. The announcement caused major U.S. stock indexes to fall sharply, signaling renewed market volatility and uncertainty over future trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

The family alleges the team knew or should have known that former communications director Eric Kay was supplying players with illicit drugs. Kay was convicted and sentenced to 22 years for providing the fentanyl-laced pills that led to Skaggs' overdose in 2019.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is centered on a dispute over extending enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which make health insurance affordable for 24 million Americans. Democrats insist on extending the credits before the November 1 open enrollment period, warning that premiums could double otherwise. Republicans argue there is more time, as the credits don't expire until December, but insurance commissioners warn that delaying will cause confusion and could lead to millions becoming uninsured.

          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are reportedly discussing the sale of portions of the government's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to private investment firms. The move aligns with a broader goal of reducing federal involvement in student lending but raises significant concerns among borrower advocates. Critics warn that transferring debt to private entities could strip borrowers of federal protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the potential for loan forgiveness, while prioritizing profit over borrower welfare.

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are experiencing growing anxiety as a government shutdown persists, with the Trump administration threatening mass firings and suggesting that legally guaranteed back pay might be withheld. Furloughed employees express fear for their job security and financial stability, describing the situation as being used as "political pawns." Union leaders and watchdog groups are demanding clarity, emphasizing that a 2019 law signed by Trump himself guarantees retroactive pay for all furloughed workers once a shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have utilized an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, where unrelated species independently develop similar traits like echolocation or flight. Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but this AI approach can analyze complex, high-order features in the 3D structure of proteins. The study's findings reveal a previously underrated sequence basis for how different species can evolve similar functions, offering new insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive this evolutionary process.</p>

          <p>The swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat elected to Congress in a special election in Arizona, is being delayed by Speaker Mike Johnson, who claims it cannot be done during a pro forma session. However, this justification is being questioned, as two Republicans were sworn in under similar circumstances earlier this year. The delay is preventing Grijalva from taking office and leaves her one signature short of the 218 needed on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing unclassified government files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move opposed by the White House.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case, Chiles vs. Salazar, that challenges a Colorado law banning conversion therapy for minors, a practice widely discredited by medical organizations. The case places the 1st Amendment's free speech protections for therapists against a state's interest in protecting children from harmful psychological practices. Proponents of the ban share harrowing stories of family damage and youth suicide resulting from attempts to change a minor's sexual orientation, while opponents argue that therapy is merely conversation and should not be regulated based on its viewpoint.</p>

          <p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has warned that "uncertainty is the new normal" for the global economy, a sentiment underscored by the Trump administration's latest tariff threats against China. While the global economy has shown some resilience, Georgieva cautioned that it has not been fully tested against threats like escalating trade wars, unfunded U.S. tax cuts, and a potential "sharp correction" in the AI-driven tech market. The analysis suggests that while some countries are forging new trade connections to bypass the U.S., the risk of a synchronized global downturn remains significant. (not investment advice)</p>
