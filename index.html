          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier reports being confined within the state Capitol after refusing a mandatory escort by the Department of Public Safety. This measure was imposed on House Democrats who had previously left the state to break quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting plan aimed at creating more GOP-leaning congressional seats. Collier states she is challenging the decisions being made and that Democrats are preparing a legal fight against the new maps. The situation highlights the intense political battle over redistricting in Texas following the walkout.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced the deployment of 4.5 million militia members in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. This move follows the U.S. administration increasing the bounty for his arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and launching anti-drug operations in the Caribbean. Maduro characterized the U.S. actions as aggressive and called for the formation of peasant and worker militias to defend the nation's sovereignty. The announcement escalates tensions between the two countries amid ongoing political and economic crises in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>A summit in Washington involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump, and several European leaders marked a potential turning point in the approach to the war in Ukraine. The meeting focused on establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, which President Trump endorsed, describing them as similar to NATO's mutual defense clause without formal membership. Following the talks, Trump proposed a trilateral summit with Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a new diplomatic path. European leaders expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing unity and Ukraine's sovereignty while remaining wary of Russia's intentions.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking its first miss on both metrics since 2014. Despite this, the company maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating sales growth driven by professional contractors and a gradual recovery in home improvement activity. Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail noted that while homeowners still show a "deferral mindset," there are encouraging signs, such as an increase in big-ticket transactions. The company's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could further stimulate the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly pouring money into Europe's top soccer clubs, driven by soaring revenues and valuations that have grown exponentially over the past few decades. The Premier League and other major European leagues have seen revenue balloon, making teams attractive assets for American owners and private equity firms. This trend has popularized the multi-club ownership model, which offers marketing and financial benefits but is drawing scrutiny from regulators like UEFA. As broadcast revenue growth slows, new strategies, such as stadium enhancements and playing regular season games overseas, are being explored to sustain financial expansion.

The regional "Sigma Plan" involves giving rivers more space through "depoldering," creating controlled flood zones and nature reserves that absorb excess water and release it slowly. While initially met with resistance, these projects have proven effective and now serve as international models for climate adaptation and community engagement.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume operations after its flight attendants' union, CUPE, announced a tentative agreement, bringing an end to a days-old strike that disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The walkout, which began over the weekend, centered on demands for better pay and compensation for ground duties, for which attendants were not previously paid. The strike had been declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, but the union initially defied the order. The resolution followed renewed negotiations with a mediator, averting further travel chaos during the peak summer season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal author Ingrid Seward, Prince William's deep mistrust of Meghan Markle is a primary reason for the persistent rift with his brother, Prince Harry. Seward claims that William is influenced by the Duchess of Sussex's unpopularity among monarchists in the U.K., who view her as damaging to the royal family. The article suggests that concerns over private family discussions becoming public for commercial projects also prevent reconciliation. Despite Harry's reported desire to mend fences, particularly with his ailing father, the lack of trust, stemming from the couple's tell-all interviews and Harry's memoir, remains a significant barrier.</p>

          <p>A jury has convicted 38-year-old Donald Jamesbrown Henry of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing his friend, Shawn Popp, during a 2022 argument. The dispute reportedly began over differing views on Donald Trump's business history and whether his companies had gone bankrupt. Henry claimed he acted in self-defense after Popp allegedly struck him, but investigators found insufficient evidence to support the use of deadly force. He now faces a sentence ranging from over 16 years to life in prison for the killing, which highlights the dangerous potential of polarized political discourse.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research survey found that nearly half of Americans believe public behavior has become more impolite since the pandemic, sparking a debate about a potential "crisis of rudeness." Etiquette expert Lizzie Post suggests that while every generation tends to view the past as more polite, today's society faces a crisis of attention, with technology making people less aware of their impact on others. Experts also point to increased stress and societal negativity as contributing factors to incivility. What is considered rude varies across cultures and generations, but the consequences, such as poor mood and decreased cooperation, are widely felt.</p>

          <p>German law enforcement has been active on several fronts, including conducting large-scale raids targeting motorcycle gangs in three states on suspicion of extortion. In a separate incident, police arrested a driver on the autobahn with a dangerously high blood-alcohol level of 4.16 g/L after he was reported for speeding and swerving erratically. Additionally, high-profile trials are underway, one involving nine individuals with ties to the far-right Reichsbürger movement accused of terrorism, and another for a former far-left RAF terrorist for her role in a 2016 armored truck robbery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively rolling back federal efforts aimed at curbing gun violence, a move that critics argue will disproportionately harm Black communities. Gun violence is the leading cause of death for American children, with young Black men being the most affected group. The administration is pushing to weaken federal oversight of the gun industry, cut funding for violence intervention programs, and permit gun sales without background checks. This reversal of policies implemented under the previous administration comes as communities like Bogalusa, Louisiana, continue to grapple with a surge in firearm deaths that began during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described the recent White House summit on Ukraine as a significant step forward, particularly praising President Trump's commitment to U.S. involvement in security guarantees for the nation. Starmer, who attended the meeting with other European leaders, hailed the progress toward a potential meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin as a positive development for achieving a lasting peace. Despite lingering anxiety about Ukraine's future, the UK government appears focused on strengthening Ukraine's position for any negotiations, viewing the U.S. commitment as a key factor that allows for greater diplomatic flexibility.</p>

          <p>Cardiotonic steroids, potent toxins produced by animals like the cane toad, can induce a fatal heart attack in predators, serving as a powerful defense mechanism. However, evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi's research reveals that some predators have developed adaptations to safely consume these toxins. Interestingly, these same compounds have been utilized in human medicine since ancient Egypt. Today, specific versions of these toxic steroids are prescribed by doctors to treat congestive heart failure, showcasing a fascinating intersection of evolutionary biology and modern pharmacology where a poison can also be a life-saving treatment.</p>

          <p>The interpretation of crime data in Washington, D.C., has become a central point of contention between the Trump administration and local city leaders following the deployment of the National Guard. While the White House points to a near-doubling of the homicide rate since 2012 to justify its intervention, Mayor Muriel Bowser highlights that overall violent crime is at a 30-year low despite a recent spike. Experts explain that crime trends can be framed differently depending on the chosen timeframe, and while D.C. faces challenges, its situation is not the worst among similarly sized cities, making direct comparisons complex.</p>

The musical's creators, Jason Robert Brown and Alfred Uhry, emphasize the timeliness of the story, which explores themes of hatred and injustice in America. They see performing the show on this prominent national stage as a crucial opportunity to present a counternarrative to rising currents of intolerance.</p>

          <p>A free summer camp at Princeton University, AI4All, is working to close the emerging "AI divide" in education by teaching high schoolers from low-income families about artificial intelligence. Research indicates that affluent, suburban school districts are more likely to provide AI training and resources than their urban, rural, or high-poverty counterparts, creating an equity gap. The camp provides an intensive, three-week on-campus experience where students learn the principles behind AI and work on real-world applications. The program aims to democratize AI education and empower a more diverse generation of students to shape the future of the technology.</p>

          <p>As students return to school, immigrant families across the U.S. are experiencing increased fear and anxiety due to the Trump administration's focus on deporting undocumented migrants. In response, major school districts like Los Angeles and Chicago have implemented new guidelines to protect students and limit access for federal immigration agents on school grounds without a judicial warrant. Educators report that this climate of fear has led to student absenteeism and even families unenrolling their children from school. Despite DHS assurances that schools are not being targeted, the lifting of restrictions on raids in sensitive areas has left many communities on edge.</p>

Political analyst Thapelo Tselapedi suggests this criticism is a strategic U.S. response to South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice and its role in the BRICS bloc. The U.S. actions, including tariffs and aid cuts under the Trump administration, are seen as attempts to undermine South Africa's international standing. The South African government has called the U.S. report "deeply flawed" and based on discredited information.</p>
