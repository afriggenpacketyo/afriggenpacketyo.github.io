          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of Donald Trump's tariffs has minimal immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports to the US. While the UK has a deal with the US to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this agreement has not yet been implemented. The UK government is working to implement the deal quickly, but the White House intends to appeal the court's decision, creating uncertainty for businesses.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter earnings revealed strong sales growth of 69%, driven by demand for its data center GPUs used in artificial intelligence, however, US export controls restricting sales of its H20 chip are hindering growth in the Chinese market, which Nvidia estimates to be a $50 billion opportunity. The company expects to sell $45 billion in chips during the July quarter, but missed out on $2.5 billion in sales during the April quarter due to these restrictions. Cloud providers, including Microsoft and Google, remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, where its GPUs serve AI models to millions of customers, driven by surging demand for reasoning AI. (not investment advice)</p>

An inverted yield curve has led to short-term CDs offering higher rates than longer-term options, and investors can consider laddering CDs to take advantage of these high rates while saving for the long term.

A warehouse run by the U.N.â€™s World Food Program was broken into by hungry Palestinians seeking food, resulting in reported casualties. Israel and Hamas are considering a new cease-fire proposal mediated by President Trumpâ€™s special envoy, which includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The main point of contention remains Israel's insistence on resuming fighting if Hamas does not surrender and disarm, while Hamas demands guarantees of a permanent cessation of hostilities.</p>

Despite Hamas threats, Palestinians are flocking to aid sites erected by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), leading to chaotic scenes. Hamas aims to portray the aid delivery negatively to regain power, but the GHF reports distributing thousands of food boxes and meals.

          <p>President Trump's strategy of praising and excusing Vladimir Putin has failed to achieve progress towards peace in Ukraine, leading to questions about whether Trump is being misled. Despite Trump's claims of leveraging his relationship with Putin, Russia has continued its aggression, prompting Trump to express disappointment and consider distancing himself from negotiations. Trump's recent warning to Russia, describing Putin as "absolutely CRAZY!," contrasts with his earlier admiration. Experts and members of Congress are increasingly critical of Trump's approach, arguing that Putin is exploiting him and that a tougher stance is needed.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump would be wrong to withdraw from cease-fire talks regarding Ukraine, as it would encourage further aggression from Putin. The board acknowledges Trump's valid points about the human cost and potential economic benefits of ending the war, but asserts that an American withdrawal would embolden Russia. Instead, Trump should increase pressure on both sides to reach a deal, leveraging potential sanctions and support for Ukraine. A likely deal would involve Russia retaining territory and promises of lifted sanctions, while Ukraine receives security guarantees and closer integration with the European economy.</p>
