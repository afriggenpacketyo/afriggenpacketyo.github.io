          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair and President Trump Publicly Disagree on Renovation Costs</h2>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement over the cost of renovating the Fed's headquarters during a site visit. Trump claimed costs had ballooned to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining it incorrectly included a building completed years ago. Despite the friction and prior threats from Trump to fire Powell over the project, the president stated such a move isn't necessary. The exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the two, particularly concerning Trump's pressure for the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>Israeli and U.S. negotiating teams have departed from ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, citing a lack of good faith from Hamas. A U.S. special envoy stated that Hamas's latest response showed no desire to reach an agreement, prompting a re-evaluation of options to secure the release of hostages and end the conflict. An Israeli official clarified that the withdrawal was not a total collapse of negotiations but a necessary step due to Hamas's rigid stance. The departure comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the UN reporting severe malnutrition.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, was hit by severe flash flooding following another bout of heavy rainfall, leading to road closures and rescues. Video footage captured a home being swept away by the rushing waters, a stark illustration of the flood's power. This event is the latest in a series of floods to devastate the community this summer, as past wildfires have left the mountainous terrain unable to absorb the intense monsoon rains. While significant property damage occurred, authorities reported no fatalities or injuries from this most recent incident.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. Macron framed the decision as part of France's commitment to a just peace and urged an immediate ceasefire and massive humanitarian aid for Gaza. The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it rewards terrorism. The United States also rejected the announcement, calling the decision reckless and a setback for peace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, arguing that its sanctuary city laws unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit claims these policies prevent necessary communication between local and federal law enforcement, thereby endangering public safety by releasing criminals onto the streets. This legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty CBP officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. City officials and immigrant advocacy groups defended the policies, stating they are crucial for ensuring all residents, regardless of status, feel safe reporting crimes.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to experimentally observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces, using folded graphene. Their findings, published in Nature Communications, revealed a surprising effect where some thicker folds of the material slid more easily, challenging classical physics principles. The scientists traced this phenomenon to how bending the material altered its electronic structure, making it harder for motion to convert into heat. This breakthrough could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices and machines with minimal wear and tear.</p>

The boom is driven by affordable housing, attracting first-time homeowners from the expensive Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, this explosive growth has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt construction to allow its infrastructure, including sewer lines, water, and roads, to catch up.

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge ruled that the complainant's testimony was not credible or reliable, and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The case centered on whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player, consented to subsequent sexual acts with the other four who entered the room. The players' lawyers argued she gave consent, a position the judge ultimately found more plausible based on the evidence presented.</p>

          <p>Four traders convicted of rigging the Libor benchmark interest rate are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark UK Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were prosecuted in the same wide-ranging investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The original scandal, which came to light after the 2008 financial crisis, involved banks manipulating rates for profit. This new legal challenge suggests the fallout from the Libor affair is far from over.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating political pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a top Justice Department official met with his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche occurred in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is imprisoned for sex trafficking. This development follows the DOJ's controversial announcement that it would not release more Epstein documents, drawing criticism from across the political spectrum. The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the files and Maxwell's testimony, intensifying the focus on the late sex offender's network.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient from California is facing deportation to El Salvador after he accidentally drove across the border into Mexico while working as a rideshare driver. Upon trying to re-enter the U.S. minutes later, he was detained by border officials who determined he had "self-deported," thereby invalidating his DACA protections. His lawyer says he made an honest mistake after missing a freeway exit, but he is now in a detention facility slated for expedited removal.

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is scorching Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for an unprecedented number of days. The extreme heat is disrupting life in the Arctic region, affecting the famed reindeer who are fleeing to roads to escape insects, and puzzling tourists who expected cool weather. While this specific event isn't directly caused by climate change, scientists state that global warming has amplified its intensity. The heatwave serves as a stark reminder that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.</p>

As part of the deal, Skydance has made commitments to the FCC to install a news ombudsman to evaluate bias complaints and end diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, drawing sharp dissent from the commission's sole Democrat, who called it a blow to press freedom.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes major tech companies are underspending on artificial intelligence, arguing that the field represents a "winner-take-all" opportunity. He asserts that increased capital expenditures, such as Alphabet's recent $10 billion addition, are both urgent and necessary to secure dominance. Cramer dismisses skepticism about the technology's profitability, comparing the current AI race to the early days of internet search. He predicts the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly and reap hundreds of billions in profits. (not investment advice)</p>

The challenge lies in matching the vibrancy and shelf life of artificial dyes, which consumers have come to expect. This shift is driven by new FDA regulations and pledges from major food giants to eliminate synthetic dyes from their products amid growing health concerns.</p>
