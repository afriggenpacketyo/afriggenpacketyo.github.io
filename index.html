            <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 10,000 pages of previously classified records related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The disclosure, supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to provide maximum transparency into the decades-old killing and includes handwritten notes by Sirhan Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene photos, and FBI memos. While many details were already known, the release could reignite speculation about the assassination, particularly given RFK Jr.'s doubts about Sirhan's guilt. The documents also include FBI memos about Sirhan's background and Ethel Kennedy's reaction to the shooting.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been moved to a new prison with improved conditions after being traumatized in the CECOT mega-jail. Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, stated that Garcia expressed sadness over his imprisonment for crimes he did not commit. The Trump administration maintains Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his family and attorneys deny, and insists he will not be allowed back into the U.S. Despite court orders to facilitate his return, the White House continues to assert that he is a violent person.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, now in its sixth week, has highlighted the disparity between wealthier and poorer areas of the city, with waste piling up in densely populated, inner-city neighborhoods. Residents describe the smell as horrendous and report infestations of rats, while wealthier areas experience fewer problems. The strike began after bin workers were told some workers would be downgraded and have their pay cut. Efforts to resolve the strike are ongoing, with the council aiming to reorganize waste collection to make it fairer once the strike is over.</p>

The government alleges the migrants are members of the Tren De Aragua gang. The ACLU contends the notices given to migrants are inadequate and violate their rights to contest deportation.</p>

This stance contrasts with previous administrations that emphasized the need to contain Russian expansionism. Rubio's comments follow landmark talks in Paris and precede a meeting in London, which he suggests will be decisive. This comes as the U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral resources, potentially intertwined with the peace push.</p>

Kevin Warsh is being considered as a potential replacement for Powell, although Warsh has advised Trump to let Powell finish his term.

            <p>California Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff are urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to end unannounced "welfare checks" on students at Los Angeles schools, calling the actions "terrorizing" and undermining public trust. The senators are demanding answers from DHS officials about the nature, scale, and objectives of the checks, as well as policies surrounding them. Federal agents showed up at two elementary schools without warrants and asked to speak with students, falsely claiming families had given permission.</p>

            <p>The ACLU has filed an emergency request with the US Supreme Court to halt what they describe as imminent deportations of Venezuelan men detained in Texas. The ACLU argues that the men are being deported without the judicial review previously ordered by the court, in violation of the Alien Enemies Act. They claim the men were given notices stating they were classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and would be deported immediately. Federal judges in other districts have blocked similar deportations until detainees have a chance to argue their case in court.</p>

            <p>Apple's global supply chain, heavily reliant on manufacturing in China, has become a vulnerability amidst rising US tariffs on Chinese imports. While smartphones were temporarily exempted, the Trump administration is investigating the electronics supply chain, raising concerns about future tariffs. The US is pushing for companies to onshore manufacturing, but moving Apple's assembly operations to the US is considered unrealistic. Apple's dependence on China creates a complex situation as US-China tensions escalate, with potential impacts on both economies.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national, is at the center of a deportation case after being mistakenly sent to an El Salvador mega-prison by the Trump administration.

The case has sparked a legal battle, with a judge demanding daily updates on efforts to bring him back to the US. Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Ábrego García in El Salvador, reporting he had been moved to a new prison with better conditions.</p>

            <p>A recently agreed mineral deal between the US and Ukraine, intended to support Ukraine's recovery in exchange for a share of profits from its natural resources, has been overshadowed by a threat from President Trump to withdraw from peace negotiations. This threat undermines Ukraine's diplomatic position and benefits Russia, which continues to demand more Ukrainian territory. While Kyiv agreed to a ceasefire after the US paused military aid, Moscow has not softened its demands. Deadly Russian missile strikes on civilians continue, but have not elicited condemnation from the White House.</p>
