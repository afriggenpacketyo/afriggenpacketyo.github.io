          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 20:38:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a plan to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. to match those of other high-income countries, threatening price caps on Medicare reimbursements if pharmaceutical companies don't comply. He claims this "most favored nation" approach could reduce prices by 50% to 90% almost immediately. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this, arguing it would stifle innovation and give foreign governments control over U.S. drug pricing. Pharmacy benefit managers praised Trump's recognition of the price issue, though the plan also aims to cut out these 'middlemen' by allowing direct purchases from manufacturers.

          <p>An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report, obtained and published by the Environmental Defense Fund after the EPA failed to release it, shows that the U.S. is not reducing greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to meet its climate goals. The report, analyzing data from 1990-2023, indicates that gross emissions dropped 17% since 2005, but a 61-66% reduction is needed by 2035. Concerns are rising that the Trump administration's policies, which prioritize fossil fuels and weaken clean energy investments, could reverse the progress made in reducing emissions from the transportation and electric power sectors. The transportation sector currently produces the most carbon dioxide emissions, followed by the electric power sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump justified his plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar by comparing it to accepting a 'gimme' putt in golf, referencing a saying attributed to golfer Sam Snead. This New York Times article details the ethical concerns surrounding the gift, considering Trump's previous criticisms of Qatar and his family's ongoing business deals with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Critics argue that accepting such a gift blurs the lines between public office and personal gain, echoing previous controversies over Trump's business dealings while in office. Trump dismissed the concerns, stating that he would be 'stupid' to turn down a free jet.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to explore potential cost-saving measures for the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project connecting Baltimore to Washington, D.C. The project's estimated cost has increased from $6 billion to $8.5 billion, prompting the FRA to seek alternative solutions. However, this New York Times article notes that the discussions have raised concerns about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given his advisory role to President Trump and his leadership of companies regulated by federal agencies.

The release occurred as President Trump departed for a trip to the Middle East, and Hamas stated it was a goodwill gesture towards a lasting ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Simultaneously, Japanese scientists are building Hyper K, an advanced version of their existing neutrino detector.

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the second Trump administration's apparent disregard for ethical norms and potential conflicts of interest. The article cites examples such as the plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar, the auctioning of access to the president through a cryptocurrency, and the dismantling of a Justice Department unit investigating cryptocurrency crimes. It argues that the administration is openly leveraging the president's position for personal gain and that traditional guardrails around public service are being disregarded.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reveals that some participants in the contest to dine with President Trump, which required buying his family's memecoin $TRUMP, secured invitations even though they held zero coins at the end. This was due to a quirk in the rules that selected winners based on average holdings during the contest. The president and his partners who control a majority of the coins stood to benefit if the price stayed high. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the contest as selling access to the government for personal profit.</p>

The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, however, as New Jersey traditionally leans left. Democrats are also locked in a competitive primary for governor.</p>

          <p>A former top campaign aide to Kamala Harris claims that Joe Biden's delay in dropping out of the 2024 presidential election "totally fucked us." According to a new book, David Plouffe, former Obama campaign manager, believes Biden's decision to cling on after a catastrophic debate performance against Trump doomed Harris's chances. The book describes growing concerns about Biden's mental acuity and desperate efforts to hide his decline. Other prominent figures, including Obama and Chuck Schumer, reportedly tried to intervene and convince Biden to step aside.</p>
