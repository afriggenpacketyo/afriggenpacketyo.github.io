          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has officially launched its eye-scanning identity verification system in the United States. The project uses a spherical biometric device called an Orb to scan irises, creating a unique "IrisCode" to verify human identity and prevent fraud. Users receive Worldcoin's cryptocurrency, WLD, for free and can use their World ID for sign-in with integrated platforms like Minecraft and Reddit. Worldcoin has partnered with Visa to introduce the "World Visa card" and Match Group to pilot World ID with Tinder in Japan, and it plans to deploy 7,500 Orbs by the end of the year, and has faced scrutiny over data storage practices, with the project decentralizing data to protect user privacy.</p>

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, are expected to leave their posts in the Trump White House. Waltz faced scrutiny after mistakenly including a journalist in a Signal chat discussing plans for a military strike on Houthi targets. President Trump signaled his support for Waltz at the time, but sources suggest the departures are framed as part of a reorganization. Wong previously served as deputy special representative for North Korea and helped negotiate Mr. Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, while potential replacements for Waltz include Stephen Miller and Seb Gorka.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine signed a minerals deal that could bring significant investment into a joint fund to rebuild Ukraine after the war with Russia. The agreement establishes an investment fund managed by both Kyiv and Washington, focusing on critical minerals, oil, and gas projects. While the deal omits a security guarantee that Ukraine sought, it ensures the U.S. could send more military aid if a peace deal isn't reached, and this agreement signals to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine over the long term. The deal ties Mr. Trump to Ukraine’s future, potentially ensuring continued U.S. interest in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals and two Mexico-based entities linked to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The sanctions target the group's fuel theft network, which U.S. officials allege is involved in the transportation and distribution of illicit drugs into the United States. One of the sanctioned individuals, Cesar Morfin Morfin, is accused of owning exotic animals and luxury vehicles, and the U.S. Treasury released an image of a jaguar seized from him. The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with the sanctioned entities, and the cartel is led by Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, for whose capture Washington has offered a $15 million reward.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that semaglutide, known as Wegovy and Ozempic, may benefit patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition linked to obesity and diabetes. The study found significant improvements in liver health among patients treated with semaglutide, reducing liver inflammation and scarring. Dr. Celine Gounder notes that this is significant as there has been no specific FDA-approved treatment for this condition, which affects an estimated 17 million Americans. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm these promising results.</p>

The report claims medical treatment harms are "sparse" and therapy should be favored, contradicting major medical associations. This review responds to an executive order calling for a review of evidence by the health department. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticize the report as "discredited junk science" akin to conversion therapy, while the report supports the position of right-leaning states banning gender-affirming treatments.</p>

The order clarifies that his permanent injunction does not prohibit administration officials from moving forward with removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act, but the decision is likely to be appealed.</p>
