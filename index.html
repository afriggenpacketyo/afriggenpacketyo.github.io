          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia are returning home, following warnings from the South Korean president and Hyundai's CEO about the raid's impact. The workers' departure was delayed due to a request from the White House, and President Lee Jae Myung expressed concerns that the raid would deter future investments in the US. The US government defended the operation, stating that foreign companies are welcome to bring workers into the country legally.
