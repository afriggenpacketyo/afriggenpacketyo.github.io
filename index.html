          <p>Silver prices experienced a significant surge, reaching their highest level in 13 years, mirroring a broader rally in precious metals markets.

          <p>Bryana Bongolan testified in the Sean Combs trial, recounting an alleged incident where Combs purportedly dangled her over a balcony, which Combs' defense team contends never occurred. Bongolan stated that she has no doubt the incident happened, though she could not specify the exact date. The defense argued that Bongolan's testimony was motivated by financial gain, suggesting she was seeking to become a millionaire through the lawsuit, which Bongolan denied. The judge warned Combs against making facial expressions during the testimony, threatening to exclude him from the courtroom if such behavior continued. Optimism regarding the outcome of the trial is low, considering the conflicting accounts and potential motivations of the witnesses.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and Donald Trump engaged in a public dispute after Musk criticized Trump's budget bill, which is currently under consideration in the Senate. Trump responded by stating that Musk opposed the bill due to the elimination of electric vehicle credits and the president's rejection of Musk's NASA pick. Musk fired back, asserting that Trump would have lost the election without his support and financial backing, claiming to have spent over $250 million on Trump's 2024 campaign. The exchange highlights a significant fracture between two influential figures, raising questions about the future of their relationship and the potential impact on Republican unity. </p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April as demand for imports declined, following a surge related to President Trump's tariff announcements. The deficit fell to $61.6 billion, a significant decrease from the previous month's $76.7 billion, as imports decreased by 16.3% and exports increased by 3%. This shift reflects adjustments in trade patterns following the imposition of tariffs, though some economists caution against interpreting the deficit reduction as entirely positive news. While the trade imbalance with China remains the largest, ongoing trade talks suggest potential for further adjustments in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" faces scrutiny due to potential cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which provide healthcare and food assistance to millions of Americans. The bill proposes significant reductions to Medicaid, potentially causing approximately 10.9 million people to lose coverage over the next decade, and cuts to SNAP, totaling an estimated $230 billion over 10 years. Republicans argue these cuts aim to reduce waste and abuse in these programs to fund tax cuts and increase funding for border security and defense. The proposed changes include stricter work requirements, increased eligibility checks, and limitations on coverage for undocumented migrants, impacting access to essential services for vulnerable populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of U.S. gun manufacturers, blocking a lawsuit filed by the government of Mexico that sought to hold the companies accountable for the trafficking of their weapons to cartels. Justice Elena Kagan stated that federal law grants broad immunity to U.S. gun companies and protects them from Mexico's claims. The lawsuit sought $10 billion in damages and safety regulations for U.S.-made guns, but the court determined that Mexico did not meet the bar for proving the gun companies aided and abetted unlawful sales. The decision is the first time the high court has weighed in on gunmaker immunity, with reactions ranging from disappointment to support.</p>

          <p>Families are pleading for the release of migrants being detained at routine check-ins with the Department of Homeland Security, with reports of increased arrests and expedited deportations. One case involves a Colombian-Venezuelan family who sought asylum in the U.S. and were separated at the border, with the husband now facing detention and potential deportation. Attorneys are raising concerns about the Trump administration's expansion of expedited removal processes, which allow for streamlined deportations without requiring migrants to appear before a judge in some cases. The detentions have sparked emotional reactions from families and questions about the fairness of the immigration enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>Democrats and civil rights groups have strongly criticized President Trump's travel ban on 12 countries, labeling it as "reckless," "racist," and an attempt to distract from his tax bill. The ban, which includes countries like Afghanistan and Haiti, is defended by Trump as necessary for national security, citing factors such as foreign policy and counter-terrorism goals. Critics argue that the ban is discriminatory, isolates the U.S., and will not improve national security. The move has sparked concerns about the separation of families and the potential for the policy to put people at deadly risk, with some suggesting it is rooted in racism rather than security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether President Joe Biden used an autopen to sign documents while in office, alleging a conspiracy by Biden aides to cover up his cognitive decline. Trump tasked White House Counsel David Warrington with investigating whether individuals deceived the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercised presidential authorities. Biden has dismissed these claims as ridiculous and false, stating that he made the decisions about pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations during his presidency. The investigation follows renewed scrutiny of Biden's mental and physical capacity, and raises questions about the validity of executive actions.</p>

          <p>Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, potentially driven by growing concerns about the retirement system's stability amid cutbacks under the Trump administration. The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% through May, with new filings on track to reach 4 million for the federal fiscal year. Experts suggest the surge is linked to job cuts at the Social Security Administration and fears about the program's future, although demographic shifts and policy changes may also contribute. While claiming early provides immediate benefits, it results in a permanently lower monthly payment, leading to recommendations to delay filing if possible. (not investment advice)</p>
