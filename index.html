          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has found that the fire at an electrical substation that caused a major shutdown at Heathrow Airport was due to a problem first identified in 2018. The issue, involving moisture in electrical components, was reportedly left "unaddressed" for years, with planned maintenance by National Grid being canceled. The power failure affected over 66,000 customers, including the airport, leading to widespread flight cancellations and travel chaos for approximately 270,000 passengers. Following the findings, energy regulator Ofgem has launched an investigation into National Grid for the significant infrastructure failure.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for their Colombian forward, Luis Diaz. The Premier League club has made it clear that the 28-year-old player is not for sale at any price this summer and they will not engage in transfer discussions. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Diaz is considered a key player for Liverpool, having scored 22 goals for his club and country last season and playing an integral role in the team's success.</p>

The verdicts on the other charges, which include sex trafficking and transportation for prostitution, have not been disclosed. The judge has urged the jurors to continue their efforts to reach a unanimous decision on the complex racketeering charge, which carries a potential life sentence.

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation over a sandal design that critics say was copied from traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals. Following a social media outcry and a call from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, a Prada executive acknowledged the design's inspiration from the handcrafted Indian footwear. The company stated the design is in an early phase and may not reach the market, committing to a dialogue with Indian artisan communities. This incident has prompted Indian authorities to pursue a patent for the traditional sandals to protect them from future copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>A wild storm has battered Australia's southeast coast, causing significant disruption, including power outages for over 35,000 properties in New South Wales. The severe weather conditions, which included intense rainfall of up to 150 millimeters in some areas, led to the issuance of seven emergency warnings. Major airlines Qantas and Virgin Australia canceled at least 55 domestic flights in and out of Sydney, and some international flights were delayed. Emergency services reported that communities heeded warnings, which helped mitigate property damage and loss of life, though conditions are expected to worsen before easing.</p>

          <p>Santander has announced a deal to acquire TSB from its Spanish owner, Sabadell, for Â£2.65 billion, a move that would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current accounts. While the deal requires shareholder and regulatory approval, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which could lead to the disappearance of the TSB brand from High Streets. Santander's chief executive indicated that while no final decisions have been made, the bank typically uses the Santander brand globally. The merger is expected to create efficiency savings, likely resulting in job cuts and branch closures where there is overlap. (not investment advice)</p>

In some of the most disturbing cases, sponsors who falsely claimed to be family members impregnated the minor girls placed in their care. The initiative was launched to locate at-risk children placed with improperly vetted sponsors, highlighting systemic failures in the protection of vulnerable minors who crossed the border.</p>

          <p>A landmark truth-telling inquiry in Victoria, Australia, has formally concluded that British colonists committed genocide against the state's Indigenous population. The Yoorrook Justice Commission's report found that mass killings, disease, and cultural destruction caused the Aboriginal population to fall from 60,000 to 15,000 within two decades of colonization in the 1830s. The report includes 100 recommendations for redress, including potential reparations and a significant overhaul of the education and health systems to combat endemic racism. The Victorian government has stated it will carefully consider the findings, which have been called "indisputable" by Indigenous leaders.</p>

Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, arguing Saenz's crimes were "senseless" and "sadistic."

The university stated it was always in compliance with NCAA rules at the time but acknowledged the competitive disadvantage some athletes faced.

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has directly addressed the issue of intense price wars plaguing many of the country's industries. At a high-level economic meeting, Xi stated that the government must lawfully regulate "disorderly low-price competition" to protect innovation and product quality. This explicit language marks a shift from the vaguer term "involutionary competition" previously used by officials. The move signals Beijing's intent to tackle the harmful effects of companies aggressively cutting prices to capture market share, which can hinder industrial upgrading and overall economic health.

          <p>Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview. The lawsuit alleged election interference due to how an answer from then-Vice President Kamala Harris was edited and presented across different programs. Legal observers described the lawsuit as weak, suggesting the settlement was a strategic business decision by Paramount, whose sale to Skydance Media is under review by the Trump-led FCC. The deal, which includes no apology, is seen by critics as a blow to journalistic independence.</p>
