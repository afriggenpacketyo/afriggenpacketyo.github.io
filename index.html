          <h2>Cheap Chinese Solar Panels Disrupting Pakistan's Energy Market</h2>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should take a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by exporting solar panels, potentially creating a model for the Global South; however, a Chinese energy scholar questions the financial viability. The increasing influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, leading to stranded assets. Pakistan has become the second-largest destination for Chinese solar panels due to a zero tax rate, causing a strategic contradiction where China's solar panels are outcompeting its own power plants. The country has witnessed a rapid transition to distributed solar power generation on rooftops in recent years.</p>

          <p>Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor, argues that President Trump's tariff policies have disrupted the global trading system, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The constant threat of tariffs undermines trade and weakens economic ties, destabilizing international relations. By disregarding free trade agreements and hindering the World Trade Organization, Trump has undermined the international rules-based order. Ultimately, Prasad concludes that these tariffs will make the world a poorer and more perilous place. (not investment advice)</p>

The Japan Tourism Agency is shifting its focus from inbound visitors to domestic travelers, whose numbers are down 8.2 percent compared to 2019. The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that encourages engagement between travelers and locals, moving away from the typical tourist experience, aiming to increase the frequency and duration of domestic trips, while hot spring resorts and local food remain popular trip themes for nearly all age groups.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, citing national security interests and insufficient vetting processes. The ban affects citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and also partially restricts entrance for nationals of seven other countries. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017, which was later ended by President Biden in 2021, and Democratic lawmakers have voiced opposition to the new ban, arguing it will not make America safer, while certain travelers, such as U.S. permanent residents and athletes attending major sporting events, are excepted from the rule.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Biden conspired to deceive the public about his mental state by using an autopen to sign documents. Trump argues that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to conceal his cognitive decline and assert Article II authority. The investigation aims to determine if there was a conspiracy to shield the public from information about Biden's health and whether his aides unconstitutionally exercised presidential authority. House Republicans have also launched an investigation into Biden's fitness to authorize the use of the autopen during the final months of his presidency.</p>

          <p>Italians will participate in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum is considered a rare chance for Italians to make the country’s bureaucracy slightly more benevolent, as the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules for the past three decades. Prime Minister Meloni and several high-profile ministers are encouraging people to skip the vote, hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls. By relaxing the rules on naturalization, Italians would be recognizing the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process.</p>

          <p>Japanese police investigated more than 1,300 cases of stalking in 2024, the highest since a law criminalizing the act was enacted in 2000.

Police received 19,567 stalking consultations, slightly fewer than the previous year but still around the 20,000 annual mark seen recently.

          <p>Thousands of students are in limbo as the Trump administration seeks to shut down Job Corps centers, citing concerns about the program's outcomes and serious incident reports. A U.S. District Judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Trump administration's move to suspend Job Corps operations, a move they say is illegal. Students are required to abandon their dorms, and staff are working to find them housing.</p>

          <p>The future of high-stakes negotiations over Iran's nuclear program remains uncertain as the U.S. and Iran publicly clash over the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, slammed the proposal, vowing that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil. President Trump stated that any agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium, contradicting the U.S. officials who said the initial interim proposal did not prohibit Iran from enriching uranium at low levels. Optimism among both U.S. and Iranian officials appears to have cooled in recent days.</p>

          <p>Dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber have shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers were able to gain insight into how feathers evolved during this era, dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

Sable Offshore Corp. must halt restart efforts on the operation’s onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The court’s temporary restraining order on pipeline work will remain in effect through at least July 18, when a full hearing on the matter will occur.
