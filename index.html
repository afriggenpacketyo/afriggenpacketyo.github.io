          <p>Over 50 million people in the U.S. Northeast are under flood watches due to slow-moving storms capable of producing up to four inches of rain per hour. Flash flood warnings are active for major cities including New York City and Washington, D.C., with New Jersey's governor declaring a state of emergency. Widespread flooding has already been reported in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, leading to stranded vehicles and life-threatening conditions. Authorities are urging residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel as the severe weather continues.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and smoke, rescuing numerous residents over ladders, though about 30 were hospitalized. While the cause is under investigation and not considered suspicious, union officials have raised concerns about inadequate fire department staffing. The fire chief described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy" and emphasized the need for mental health support for first responders.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in history, processing a record 892,340 container units as shippers rushed to import goods before new U.S. tariffs on Chinese products take effect. Port executives describe this as a "tariff whipsaw effect" rather than a sustainable surge, anticipating a significant drop in volume once the tariffs are implemented in August. Importers are facing substantially higher costs, with some businesses seeing their tariff bills increase twenty-fold. This uncertainty complicates planning for businesses that rely on Chinese manufacturing and global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 54-pound Martian meteorite, the largest piece of Mars known to exist on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's and is expected to fetch up to $4 million. Discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023, the meteorite, designated NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, accounting for only 0.6% of all meteorites found. The rock was likely ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before traveling 140 million miles to Earth, offering a significant dataset for scientific study.</p>

          <p>A year after historic flooding devastated their South Dakota farm, the Oberg family is rebuilding their lives, having constructed a new home on a man-made hill. Lacking flood insurance, they used their savings and sold off farmland to recover from the disaster, which saw nearly a year's worth of rain fall in two months. The event highlights the growing threat of "whiplash weather" linked to climate change, where extreme precipitation is followed by drought. Despite the emotional and financial toll, local farmers are hopeful as this year's crops appear to be growing as expected.</p>

Having come into office believing he could broker a quick peace deal, Trump has grown angry as Putin has ignored his efforts and escalated attacks.

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has become a central topic of conversation at the MLB All-Star Game following his unexpected selection to the team. The 23-year-old's inclusion, after only a month in the major leagues, has drawn controversy, with some players calling it a "joke." Misiorowski's profile skyrocketed after a dominant 12-strikeout performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers last week. Despite the backlash, NL manager Dave Roberts confirmed Misiorowski will pitch in the game, stating that if it brings excitement and attention to baseball, he is all for it.</p>

          <p>"MasterChef" presenter John Torode has confirmed he is the individual alleged to have used racist language on one occasion, a claim upheld in an inquiry. The inquiry was initially ordered to investigate separate allegations against his co-host, Gregg Wallace. In a statement, Torode said he has "no recollection" of the alleged 2018 or 2019 incident and does not believe it happened, but affirmed that any racial language is "wholly unacceptable." The revelation comes after the inquiry substantiated 45 allegations of inappropriate behavior against Wallace, who has since apologized.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has publicly broken with President Trump on key issues, has amassed a significant campaign fund of over $1.7 million. This strong fundraising performance comes as Trump's political allies have launched a super PAC specifically aimed at unseating Massie in his 2026 primary. Massie's votes against Trump's tax bill and his stance on military action have drawn the former president's ire. The substantial funds will be crucial for Massie to defend his seat in an expensive district against a concerted challenge from Trump's operation.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo, who resigned as New York's governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, has announced he will run for mayor of New York City as an independent. His decision follows a loss in the Democratic primary to progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo's entry creates a complex race, as he will compete against Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent after a federal indictment. Pundits suggest the crowded field of independents and a Republican could split the vote, potentially clearing a path for Mamdani.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters in a mutual model. This "fresh vision" comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, where hundreds of postmasters were wrongly convicted, and aims to rebuild trust and transform the organization's culture. While the government does not plan to reduce the number of branches, it is exploring long-term structural changes, including mutualization or a charter model similar to the BBC. Any major change is unlikely before 2030.</p>

The decision, issued from the Court's "shadow docket," allows the administration to move forward with what the Education Secretary called "the first step on the road to a total shutdown" of the department. Critics and dissenting justices argue this move amounts to an unconstitutional impoundment of funds, as it cripples federal programs mandated by Congress by eliminating the staff needed to run them.</p>
