          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a $200 million settlement to resolve claims from the Trump administration that it discriminated against Jewish students. While not admitting wrongdoing, the university acknowledged that Jewish students and faculty have faced unacceptable incidents and that reforms are necessary. The agreement, which includes oversight by a federal monitor, will restore hundreds of millions in federal grants that had been threatened. The university will also provide certain information about foreign students to immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media highlights a significant trend of teenagers using AI chatbots for companionship, advice, and emotional support, with over 70% having used them. Researchers express concern that this could hinder the development of real-world social skills, critical thinking, and emotional resilience. While some teens find AI helpful for building confidence, experts worry about the potential for AI to replace human relationships and exacerbate youth mental health issues. The study raises alarms about the unregulated nature of AI companions and their deep integration into adolescent life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite record-high median home prices, the U.S. housing market is showing early signs of a shift that could benefit homebuyers. According to real estate firm Redfin, there were 34% more sellers than buyers in May, the highest rate since 2013, leading to increased housing inventory. However, experts note it remains a seller's market overall, as homeowners with low interest rates are hesitant to sell, keeping prices elevated. For prospective buyers, this changing dynamic may present opportunities, especially for homes that have been on the market longer or require renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete files on the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, introduced by a Democrat, passed with bipartisan support as three Republican members joined in the vote, defying their party's leadership. Republicans amended the subpoena to also seek Epstein-related communications involving the Biden administration. This move for transparency comes amid growing public pressure and recent DOJ statements that no incriminating "client list" existed in the files.</p>

While not legally binding, the decision is seen as a major victory for climate justice advocates and could set a powerful legal precedent for climate litigation worldwide.

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the 2006 investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the Justice Department's arguments for release, citing public interest and transparency, did not meet the high legal standard required to overcome grand jury secrecy rules. The decision effectively ties the court's hands in Florida, though separate requests to unseal materials in New York are still pending. This ruling is a setback for the administration's push for disclosure amid intense public and political pressure regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to ensure U.S. leadership in the global AI race, particularly against China. The plan includes over 90 policy actions focused on accelerating innovation by removing regulatory hurdles and supporting infrastructure development like data centers and semiconductor plants. Key pillars of the strategy involve creating rules to prevent ideological bias in government-contracted AI and establishing a program to export American AI packages to allies. The initiative follows an executive order that removed AI guardrails previously implemented by the Biden administration, emphasizing a pro-growth, deregulation-focused approach.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, have filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. against conservative influencer Candace Owens. The suit addresses claims repeatedly made by Owens on her podcast and social media that the first lady was born male. The legal action, filed in Delaware, states that Owens has spread "outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions" and refused to retract them. Owens has responded by standing by her allegations, calling the lawsuit a "desperate public relations strategy." The conspiracy theory has circulated for years on the fringes of the internet.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump has aggressively reshaped U.S. immigration policy, backed by the largest domestic enforcement funding in the nation's history. A report from NPR's 'Consider This' details the administration's 'shock and awe' approach, which has rapidly moved to fulfill the campaign promise of conducting the largest deportation in history. Congress has allocated tens of billions of dollars to fuel this mass deportation campaign, which has upended decades of federal policy. The segment examines the significant changes in immigration enforcement and their impact since Trump returned to office.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a dangerous power play that threatens the central bank's independence. The author contends the issue is not about monetary policy disagreements but an attempt to force the Fed to accommodate government spending through lower interest rates, a situation known as "fiscal dominance." While acknowledging Powell's past policy errors, the piece warns that politicizing the Fed to mask reckless budget deficits will inevitably lead to higher inflation and financial instability. The true problem, it concludes, is excessive government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM shares dropped in extended trading despite the company reporting second-quarter earnings and overall revenue that beat Wall Street estimates. The decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, while growing 10%, came in just below analyst consensus. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware and that geopolitical tensions led a few clients to be more cautious. On a positive note, IBM's consulting and infrastructure segments both exceeded revenue expectations, and the company's generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion.

          <p>The word "OK" is one of the most universally recognized terms on the planet, an American invention with a surprisingly playful history. Scholars trace its origin to a Boston newspaper in 1839, where it appeared as a joke abbreviation for a deliberate misspelling of "all correct" as "oll korrect." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. Its simplicity and versatility made it perfect for the telegraph age and its use has since spread globally, becoming an indispensable part of modern communication.</p>
