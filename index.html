          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film about Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Clarkson discusses Ledbetter's remarkable journey and the injustices she faced, including misogyny and ageism. Ledbetter filed a lawsuit after discovering she was paid significantly less than her male counterparts and although she initially won, the verdict was overturned, but she later became a symbol of unequal treatment in the workplace. Clarkson emphasizes that Ledbetter's story resonates with many, regardless of background, and the actress also acknowledges her own experiences with pay inequality in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has nominated Casey Means, a wellness influencer and medical doctor with an inactive license, as the next US Surgeon General. Means is known for her criticism of mainstream medicine and advocacy for a healthier food supply. Her nomination is attributed to the influence of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. However, Means's inactive medical license and criticism from right-wing figures pose significant hurdles to her confirmation. The article also raises concerns about Means's involvement with health technology companies and their potential impact on privacy and public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's selective application of the concept of "freedom of choice," noting a divergence between economic and political spheres. While promoting expanded consumer options, Trump's administration simultaneously restricts choices related to political expression, ideology, and individual identity. The author argues this reflects a new form of authoritarianism that prioritizes consumerism while curtailing other freedoms. The piece traces the historical evolution of choice as a central value in capitalist democracies and highlights the potential dangers of limiting political and intellectual options.</p>

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that Elon Musk's partnership with President Trump is ending with Musk as the clear loser. Nasaw asserts that Musk's reputation as a genius has been damaged by his unorthodox and often chaotic approach to government. His criticisms of Trump's policies and appointees, along with his bullying behavior, alienated him from the administration. The author concludes that Musk's failure demonstrates the importance of elected officials and confirmed appointees in the American system of government.</p>

          <p>The United States is pulling back from its role in promoting democratic ideals abroad under President Donald Trump. The administration has decimated the Agency for Global Media, restructured the State Department to eliminate a global democracy office, and gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development. Experts warn that these moves will create a vacuum for promoting freedom and representative government, potentially accelerating anti-democratic trends globally.

The offer follows a warning from European leaders about further sanctions if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire. While Putin claims to want peace, he insists it must be on Russia's terms. By proposing talks without an immediate ceasefire, Russia may be trying to prolong the war and split the Western coalition backing Ukraine, hoping for sanctions relief and improved relations with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Pakistanâ€™s Chinese-made weapons have demonstrated strength against Indiaâ€™s Western and Russian arms in the Kashmir conflict. Tensions between the two countries escalated after India conducted military strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a terrorist attack. While India deployed French-made Rafale jets, Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft, including three Rafales. Analysts caution that it is too early to determine which side's arms technology will ultimately prove superior in combat.</p>

          <p>After losing their home in a fire, the author and his wife initially planned to rebuild in Pacific Palisades. However, the election of Donald Trump and the growing sense of a more frightening America led them to reconsider. They decided to move to Spain, citing concerns about rising costs, potential labor shortages due to mass deportation, and the overall political climate. The author acknowledges the privilege of having this option but expresses a desire to return to rebuild their home when the United States feels more optimistic.</p>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of doomsday prepping in America, discussing its roots in American history and culture. It examines the reasons why people engage in prepping, ranging from concerns about societal collapse to individual responsibility in the face of inadequate government response to disasters. The article also touches on the role of conspicuous consumption among the ultra-wealthy and the anxieties surrounding grid failure and other potential catastrophes. It raises the question of whether individual preparedness is sufficient or if collective action is necessary to confront these challenges.</p>

          <p>A large-scale air and ground search is ongoing for a British hiker, Eli Sweeting, who has been missing for a week in New Zealand. Sweeting, originally from Bristol, was reported missing after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak in Fiordland National Park. More than 40 staff and volunteers are involved in the search, which is made difficult by the challenging terrain. Helicopters, dogs, and locals are assisting, and some of Sweeting's family have flown out to help.</p>

The UK businesses secretary has indicated that the wider aerospace industry will have a "specific guarantee of zero tariffs" in the agreement. The deal is important for both the UK and the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines and US-based repair facilities require a steady supply of parts.
