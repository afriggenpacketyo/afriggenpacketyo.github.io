          <p>This article explores the history and intended flexibility of the United States Constitution, featuring insights from historian Jill Lepore and National Constitution Center CEO Jeffrey Rosen. They discuss how the document was designed by the founders to be a work in progress, frequently amended to reflect the nation's growth, as seen with the Bill of Rights and amendments abolishing slavery and granting women suffrage. The experts express concern that modern political polarization and an overreliance on the Supreme Court for interpretation have stalled this process, creating governmental dysfunction not envisioned by the framers. Despite these challenges, they argue the Constitution's core principles remain timeless and essential for preventing tyranny.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is not cooperating with the investigation. Authorities have identified the alleged shooter as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who is now in custody with charges expected soon. The governor also confirmed the suspect's roommate was his boyfriend, who is a transgender woman and is cooperating with law enforcement. While a motive remains unidentified, the governor noted that information about the suspect's alleged "leftist ideology" has so far come from family and acquaintances rather than direct evidence.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reveals that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user of a website known for hosting graphic violence and white supremacist content. The site, which originated on Reddit before being banned, was also frequented by other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization and glorification of violence. The shooter, Desmond Holly, had posted images of another school shooter and other extremist figures on social media prior to the attack. The ADL highlights the role of these online platforms in creating a throughline between violent acts, urging for greater accountability from service providers like Cloudflare.</p>

          <p>Following a far-right march in London organized by activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that the British flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and violence. He emphasized that the flag represents the nation's diversity, tolerance, and respect, values that stand in opposition to the intimidation seen on the streets. While affirming the right to peaceful protest as a core British value, Starmer stated that assaults on police officers and the intimidation of citizens based on their background or skin color will not be tolerated. The march reportedly drew over 150,000 participants to the city center.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Urges Honest Portrayal of Charlie Kirk's Controversial Legacy After His Death</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues against the recent trend of sanitizing the public image of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk following his assassination. The author criticizes commentators, including some on the center-left, for inaccurately portraying Kirk's provocative and often hateful rhetoric as a form of virtuous political debate. The article asserts that while political violence is unequivocally wrong, an honest assessment of Kirk's career must acknowledge his opposition to civil rights, promotion of replacement theory, and disparaging remarks about women and minorities.

          <h2>Analyst Argues Israeli Society is Insulated from the Realities of the Gaza War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that Israeli society has become largely detached from the suffering in Gaza, with the ongoing war becoming a normalized backdrop to daily life. The author describes a media bubble where Palestinian casualties are abstract, and the conflict is primarily experienced through domestic political debates or memorials for fallen soldiers. The piece suggests this detachment is enabled by a military strategy that uses contractors and targeted reservist call-ups, minimizing disruption for the general public. It argues that this normalization, combined with a mythical narrative of victimhood, prevents meaningful engagement with the conflict's reality and hinders any potential for a lasting political solution.</p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing increased fear and apprehension following a Supreme Court decision that permits federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and profile individuals based on appearance. The ruling overturns a temporary restraining order that had previously limited such actions, leading to vows from the Department of Homeland Security to intensify enforcement. This has placed undocumented workers in a difficult position, forcing them to choose between the risk of deportation by going to work and the risk of eviction by staying home. Community organizers and volunteer groups are increasing their efforts to monitor ICE activity and inform residents of their rights.</p>

Many experts believe the Minnesota Lynx, driven by a desire for redemption after a controversial loss last season, are the team to beat, citing their top-ranked defense and MVP-level play from Napheesa Collier. However, the Las Vegas Aces, led by A'ja Wilson and finishing the season on a 16-game winning streak, are seen as a formidable opponent and a strong contender for the title. The absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese is viewed by some as a chance for other league stars and compelling team dynamics to take center stage.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune has expressed significant frustration with Senate Democrats for systematically delaying the confirmation process for President Trump's administrative appointments. Thune noted that this resistance is unprecedented and has forced the Senate to spend two-thirds of its time on personnel matters, a stark contrast to the smoother confirmations under previous presidents. This commentary argues that the delays are a self-inflicted problem for Republicans, who have failed to challenge Trump's nominees, many of whom are criticized for lacking competence and being chosen primarily for their loyalty. The author suggests that despite Thune's complaints, the slow pace of confirmations may ultimately be beneficial for the country.</p>

CBS News's parent company, Paramount, now controlled by Trump ally Larry Ellison's family, has appointed a conservative think tank head as its ombudsman and is reportedly considering acquiring CNN's parent company. This trend is mirrored by a settlement ensuring the Murdoch family's conservative control over Fox News and the Washington Post's move to champion free-market opinions.

          <p>The recent fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has brought renewed attention to a state law allowing permitted individuals to carry firearms openly on college campuses. The bill, which passed in August, expanded upon Utah's existing permitless carry laws and had already raised concerns among university staff about safety in classrooms and labs. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle used is unclear, the timing of the shooting has highlighted the state's permissive gun legislation. Utah lacks red-flag laws, and legislative efforts on campus safety have historically focused on hardening K-12 schools rather than restricting firearm access.</p>

This creates significant labor and financial burdens, as parents navigate complex shopping routines and budget constraints to meet these stringent dietary ideals.

Mamdani's success is attributed to a sharp focus on affordability, offering clear, compelling policies like free bus transport and a rent freeze, and crafting a strong narrative that picks a side against the wealthy elite. Furthermore, his savvy use of social media, particularly TikTok, has allowed him to connect with voters directly. In contrast, Labour is perceived as lacking a clear, overarching vision and struggling to communicate its popular policies effectively, failing to resonate with a public that increasingly consumes information through new media.</p>

          <p>A scrapbook gifted to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, has renewed questions about Donald Trump's relationship with the late sex trafficker. The book includes a mysterious message on a drawing of a female torso, attributed to Trump, which reads, "We have certain things in common, Jeffrey." Trump has denied the authenticity of the note and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for previously reporting on it. The book, released by House Democrats, contains numerous sexually suggestive entries and lists Trump, Bill Clinton, and others as "friends," fueling calls for greater transparency regarding Epstein's network of powerful associates.</p>

          <p>In this op-ed, UN Special Rapporteur Mary Lawlor shares the harrowing experiences of Palestinian human rights defenders working in Gaza amidst the ongoing war and famine. These individuals risk their lives daily, navigating active conflict zones to document atrocities, gather testimonies, and provide evidence for international accountability, often while struggling to find food and water for their own families. They report a collapse of the social order and a loss of faith in international law, which they feel has failed to protect civilians. Lawlor relays their urgent plea for an end to the violence and for the international community to ensure that war crimes have consequences.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is raising alarms among experts who see it as a potential turning point in a rising trend of political violence in the United States. Data shows a nearly 40% increase in terrorism and targeted violence plots in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, with mass casualty attacks up significantly. Analysts draw parallels to the politically turbulent 1960s but warn that modern social media and the availability of lethal weapons make the current era more dangerous. The response from political leaders is seen as crucial in either de-escalating or inflaming tensions in an already polarized environment.</p>

          <p>A bold proposal by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has been significantly scaled back following criticism from public health experts and President Donald Trump. Ladapo initially announced an effort to end every vaccine requirement, framing it as a fight for freedom. However, after Trump defended the efficacy and necessity of vaccines for diseases like measles and polio, the Florida health department clarified its position. The state is now only proposing to remove requirements for childhood immunizations not mandated for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B, leaving the major school-entry mandates in place for now.</p>

          <p>Nepal's newly appointed interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, has vowed to address the corruption that fueled recent deadly protests, which resulted in the ousting of her predecessor. The demonstrations, largely driven by young activists from "Gen Z," led to at least 72 deaths. Karki, a former chief justice whose name was put forward by protesters, acknowledged their demands for good governance and economic equality. In her first public address, she called for calm and cooperation, promising to hold elections by March 5 and to hand over power to a new government within six months, stating she did not wish to remain in the position long-term.</p>

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing the families of Israelis held by Hamas, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the sole obstacle to securing the release of their loved ones. The group claims that every time a potential deal for the hostages' return has neared, Netanyahu has sabotaged it, pointing to the recent Israeli strike in Qatar as the latest example. Netanyahu has defended the strike, arguing that eliminating Hamas leaders is necessary to free the hostages. The families counter that this is an excuse to prolong the war and cling to power, costing the lives of hostages in captivity.</p>

          <p>This op-ed tells the story of Kelvin, the birth father of the author's adopted children, who was deported to El Salvador immediately after being paroled from a California prison. While incarcerated for armed robbery, Kelvin actively pursued rehabilitation, earning certifications, taking classes, and building a positive relationship with his children. Despite his transformation, an old deportation order was enforced, sending him to a notoriously dangerous prison in El Salvador, where he is likely to be tortured. The author argues that deporting individuals who have demonstrated genuine rehabilitation undermines the justice system's goals, wastes state investment, and is ultimately inhumane and counterproductive.</p>

          <p>This article details the story of Leah Marx, a young FBI agent who, in 2010, initiated an investigation that exposed deep-seated corruption and abuse within the Los Angeles County jail system under then-Sheriff Lee Baca. Posing as a human trafficking investigator, Marx conducted secret interviews with inmates, uncovering a pattern of brutality by jailers. Her investigation escalated after orchestrating a sting involving a contraband cellphone, which led to an aggressive and obstructive response from Sheriff Baca's department, including attempts to intimidate her. This reaction ultimately expanded the federal probe from civil rights violations to a wide-ranging obstruction of justice case that convicted 22 department members, including Baca himself.</p>

Eagle was convicted of a gang-related shooting despite having a strong alibi and being on crutches from a previous injury, making it unlikely he could have committed the crime. His case was plagued by ineffective legal counsel and questionable conduct by detectives from the LAPD's infamous C.R.A.S.H. unit, which was at the center of the Rampart scandal. The California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's conviction review unit jointly filed the motion that ultimately secured his freedom.</p>

          <p>Following a request from President Trump, Missouri's state Senate has passed a new congressional voting map designed to give Republicans an advantage in a district currently held by a Democrat. This move is part of a broader, Trump-driven effort across multiple states to redraw maps mid-decade to secure the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. While Republicans in states like Texas and potentially Indiana and Florida are pursuing partisan gerrymanders, Democrats in California, Illinois, and Maryland are threatening to counter with their own redistricting plans. The actions are setting the stage for legal challenges and expensive political battles over voting power.</p>
