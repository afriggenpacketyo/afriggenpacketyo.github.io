          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in at least eight deaths and over 30 injuries across several regions of Ukraine, including Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv. This follows a day after Kyiv experienced one of the most intense assaults since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. Russia's defense ministry claims its air defense units intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over various Russian regions, including Moscow, during a four-hour period with no reported casualties. The ongoing conflict has resulted in Russia controlling approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014, and the drone attack also caused a temporary suspension of flights at Moscow airports.</p>

          <p>A Qatari businessman's campaign to lead the International Table Tennis Federation is under scrutiny amid concerns about Gulf nations' growing influence over global sports. Khalil Al-Mohannadi, a Qatari businessman, is running for president of the ITTF. A Swiss whistle-blower, Georg Silberschmidt, was detained and interrogated in Doha after distributing fliers for a players’ union. The ITTF's integrity unit is investigating potential monetary influence attempts in the upcoming election, while Mr. Al-Mohannadi has faced accusations of vote-buying in the past, which were brought to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us," a show about a zombie apocalypse caused by a fungus, and how it serves as a distraction from real-world anxieties. She reflects on how horror movies helped her cope with a miscarriage by providing a temporary escape from grief. Feintzeig acknowledges the discomfort the show brings but recognizes its value in offering a break from the overwhelming concerns of modern life. She concludes that escaping into a terrifying alternate reality can be a way to cope with the relentless nature of the real world.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian pediatrician in Gaza lost nine of her ten children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis, according to hospital officials. The doctor's husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is in intensive care, while their only surviving child was also injured. The IDF stated its aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure near IDF troops and that the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians is under review, adding that the area is a dangerous war zone from which civilians were evacuated. The WFP reports aid trucks have been looted in southern Gaza, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing a growing threat from cyberattacks targeting state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure, potentially disrupting essential services and endangering lives. The Conference for National Cybersecurity in Potsdam highlighted the urgent need for improved digital security, particularly for smaller companies and state authorities. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) reported over 333,000 registered cybercrimes in 2024, with an estimated 90% of cases going unreported, and attackers are increasingly using artificial intelligence. Despite advancements in hi-tech sabotage prevention, Germany remains vulnerable due to outdated IT systems and a need for closer cooperation between the state and businesses to enhance overall resilience.</p>

          <p>A British survey reveals that nearly half of young adults in Europe would prefer a time without the Internet, prompting a Dutch startup to organize offline meetups. The Offline Club, with almost 530,000 Instagram followers, encourages people to disconnect from social media and engage in real-world activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies show that young people spend over three hours daily on smartphones, leading to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.

Ohtani is scheduled to face batters in a simulated game, marking his first time since elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers initially considered an earlier return but prioritized his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehabilitation. The natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes a pre-All-Star return unlikely.</p>

While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful for a robust summer season.

Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning from contaminated seafood in the Minamata Bay area, with the Japanese government recognizing the cause in 1968.

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, arguing that they are a violation of human rights, even as much of the world has moved on from the pandemic. These restrictions include limiting visitations and requiring masks and temperature checks, even for terminally ill patients wishing to see loved ones. The health ministry has recommended ensuring visitation opportunities while maintaining infection control, but specific policies are left to individual hospitals. Physicians argue there is no scientific evidence that visitation restrictions are effective in preventing the spread of infections.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass anxiety to their dogs. Researchers found that when owners dwell on work problems, their dogs exhibit more stress-related behaviors like whining and pacing. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The study suggests that employed dog owners should avoid work-related ruminations at home to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, arguing that emissions from these plants do not significantly contribute to climate change. The agency contends that eliminating these emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, though power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change. The proposed regulation is part of a broader effort to uproot policies aimed at curbing climate change.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase the salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to over 6 million yen annually, up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen. This move aims to improve working conditions and attract talent amid growing competition as Japanese cuisine gains popularity worldwide. The government will also cover the cost of rented accommodation for chefs who prefer it, and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries. These improvements are expected to enable chefs to "draw their career paths more easily."</p>
