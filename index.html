          <p>A devastating house fire in Brent, north-west London, resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman, a 15-year-old girl, and two boys aged eight and four. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, in the early hours of the morning. A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, while two other individuals were hospitalized. The fire, which engulfed two three-story terraced houses, required the efforts of eight fire engines and approximately 70 firefighters to bring under control. Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire. </p>

          <p>A recent report cited by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to justify an FDA safety review of mifepristone, a drug used in most abortions in the United States, is facing scrutiny for its methodology and lack of transparency. The report, published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claims a high rate of adverse events associated with mifepristone, contradicting numerous scientific trials. Experts question the study's data sources, criteria for defining adverse events, and failure to distinguish between abortion and miscarriage outcomes. Critics worry that the FDA review may be influenced by political motivations rather than scientific evidence. </p>

          <p>Global financial markets are reacting negatively to President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which includes extending tax cuts and imposing tariffs on EU imports. The yield on 30-year US government bonds has risen, and Moody's has stripped the US of its triple-A credit rating. Concerns center on the US's 'twin deficit' and the potential for Trump's policies to fuel inflation and recession. Economists debate the dangers of high debt levels, but investors warn that patience is wearing thin as Trump's policies undermine confidence in US assets. (not investment advice) </p>
