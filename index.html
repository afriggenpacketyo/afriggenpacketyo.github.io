          <p>Oil prices experienced volatility, initially rising sharply due to concerns about a potential conflict between Israel and Iran disrupting crude supplies. President Trump commented that an Israeli attack on Iran was possible but not imminent, which contributed to the price fluctuations. The U.S. State Department advised nonessential personnel to leave Iraq, and the Pentagon authorized voluntary departures for military families in the Middle East, further fueling concerns. An analyst at JPMorgan suggested oil prices could surge to $120 per barrel if Iran blocked the Strait of Hormuz, though she deemed the risk of such a blockade as low. (not investment advice)</p>

California's governor and attorney general filed an emergency request to block the expansion of this deployment, arguing it constitutes unlawful militarization. The state contends that the situation in Los Angeles does not warrant federal intervention, while the Department of Justice argues that restricting the military's role would impede federal law enforcement.

The EPA argues that power plant emissions do not significantly contribute to the climate crisis and that the rollbacks will save the country $19 billion over two decades.

The governors argued that the deployment undermines state sovereignty and expressed confidence in local law enforcement. Republicans on the committee accused the governors of overseeing a rise in crime and blocking ICE's actions, while the governors insisted that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government. The hearing highlighted the ongoing debate over sanctuary policies and federal-state relations on immigration issues.</p>

          <p>A Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher, Kseniia Petrova, was released from U.S. custody after being arrested for smuggling frog embryos into the country. Petrova, who had been detained since February, was freed on bail with travel restrictions. The case drew attention as one of several involving academics and students detained during Trump's immigration crackdown. Petrova claimed she feared persecution if deported to Russia due to her opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, and her colleagues at Harvard emphasized her irreplaceable expertise.</p>

          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation, with recent data on consumer and producer prices remaining benign. However, expectations persist that prices will rise in the coming months due to Trump's trade policies. Factors such as companies stockpiling imported goods, the time lag for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power among companies have kept inflation in check so far. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will materialize in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

The "No Tax on Tips" provision in the GOP spending bill, which would remove federal taxes from tips for workers earning less than $160,000, could offer relief to millions of tipped workers.</p>

Middle-income families would see smaller gains, but those at the bottom of the income ladder would be worse off due to cuts in government benefits. The tax cuts would deliver the biggest savings for top earners, while families earning less than $55,000 a year would experience a net loss.
