          <p>Kathryn Bigelow's new movie, "A House of Dynamite," offers a chillingly plausible depiction of nuclear war, where a US president faces an 18-minute window to decide on retaliation after an unknown missile launch. The film starkly illustrates human fallibility within complex systems, even among rational actors, and underscores the enduring existential threat of nuclear proliferation. The article highlights the movie's intention to reignite public conversation about this critical, often-ignored danger.</p>

          <h2>Rethinking "Screen Time" as a Pervasive Reality of Modern Life</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article posits that "screen time" has evolved beyond a simple metric to be reduced, becoming an inescapable and defining aspect of contemporary existence. With screens integrated into nearly all daily activities, from work to social interactions, attempts to curtail it are largely ineffective. The author advocates for understanding this systemic omnipresence and its profound impact on human attention and perception, rather than focusing on individual mitigation efforts.</p>
