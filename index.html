          <h2>Chevron Finalizes $53 Billion Hess Acquisition Following Legal Victory Over Exxon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:21:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers, setting a significant precedent for the industry. The resolution of this dispute removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein were told to specifically flag any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin questioned the motives behind this directive and the broader handling of the Epstein files, which the administration had previously promised to release. The senator's inquiry adds to the scrutiny over the administration's decision to withhold further evidence, especially following a recent report of a letter from Trump to Epstein. This development intensifies the political controversy surrounding the late sex offender's connections to powerful figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics fell over 30% amid concerns that its key gene therapy, Elevidys, may be pulled from the market. The FDA is reportedly investigating two patient deaths linked to the treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and may ask the company to halt all shipments. Elevidys, which constitutes more than half of Sarepta's revenue, has a controversial history, having gained expanded approval despite failing to meet its primary goal in a key trial. The recent deaths have amplified safety concerns, particularly given the therapy's uncertain benefits, placing the company's future in jeopardy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International tourism to the United States experienced a 3.4% decline in the first half of 2025, primarily driven by a sharp 19% drop in visitors from Canada. This decrease in Canadian travel resulted in an estimated $1.9 billion loss in spending, significantly impacting the U.S. tourism industry. The decline was partially offset by a 12.5% increase in visitors from Mexico, who contributed nearly half a billion dollars in travel spending. The U.S. Travel Association noted that while travel remains a priority, broader economic concerns are influencing consumer behavior, with Canada being a notable exception to otherwise resilient international markets.</p>

In a social media post, she clarified that her father is not returning, stating, "You had your time." Saban, who retired after the 2023-24 season, has previously expressed frustration with the new name, image, and likeness (NIL) landscape in college athletics, suggesting it has shifted focus away from player development.</p>

          <p>Even individuals earning high salaries can struggle with credit card debt, often due to lifestyle inflation where expenses rise with income. This article outlines several strategies for high earners to manage and eliminate significant debt balances. Options include using a debt consolidation loan to combine multiple high-interest debts into a single, lower-rate payment, which can save thousands in interest. Another approach is leveraging a 0% APR balance transfer credit card to pay down the principal without accruing interest for a promotional period. Other methods discussed involve negotiating directly with creditors for lower rates or engaging a financial advisor for a tailored payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," effective when his contract ends in May 2026, citing purely financial reasons amid challenges in late-night television. However, the decision has fueled speculation that it is politically motivated, coming shortly after Colbert criticized a $16 million settlement between parent company Paramount and Donald Trump. The move is seen by some as an attempt by Paramount to curry favor with Trump, as the company seeks approval for a merger. This event is being interpreted not just as a corporate decision but as a symbolic end to an era of late-night political comedy.</p>

However, the rise of Christianity led to centuries of stigmatization and severe punishment for non-normative sexualities, often justified by religious texts.

This initiative, called Eliquis 360 Support, aligns with an industry trend toward greater price transparency and comes ahead of a lower Medicare-negotiated price set for 2026.

This growth helps insulate the company from broader concerns about a consumer slowdown. However, a notable weak spot has emerged in travel spending, specifically in economy class domestic airfare, which remained flat compared to last year. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings saw strong growth, the stall in lower-cost air travel could be a concern given Amex's extensive airline partnerships. The trend is partly attributed to declining airfare prices, meaning consumers are spending less per ticket.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring a nonimmigrant visa, including tourists, business travelers, and students. This fee, part of the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected when a visa is issued. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if the visa holder complies with all conditions, such as not overstaying their visit. However, implementation details remain unclear, and immigration experts advise clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in obtaining the money back.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi visited Alcatraz Island as part of the Trump administration's directive to convert the historic site back into a federal penitentiary. The plan, announced by President Trump, is to house the nation's "most ruthless and violent offenders" in a rebuilt facility. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from local officials like San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who called the idea foolish. They argue it ignores the site's current role as a major tourist attraction that generates millions in revenue and economic activity for the city and the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>Heightened tensions between President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are creating uncertainty for the U.S. economy and consumer finances. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates, arguing that high rates stifle the housing market and put the U.S. at a disadvantage. In contrast, Powell has indicated that the Fed is holding rates steady due to inflation risks posed by the administration's tariff policies. Economists warn that pressuring the Fed to lower rates prematurely could reignite inflation, ultimately forcing the central bank to raise rates again, which would be counterproductive for consumers waiting for borrowing costs to ease.

          <p>British author Philippa Langley, known for helping find the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. The conventional narrative holds that their uncle, Richard III, had them murdered to secure the throne. However, after a decade-long investigation called the Missing Princes Project, Langley asserts that both princes survived. Her research uncovered documents she says provide proof of life, challenging the historical account largely shaped by the subsequent Tudor dynasty. This new thesis shifts the burden of proof, arguing detractors must now find evidence the boys died.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been extradited to Oregon to face a murder charge in the 1983 death of his then-girlfriend, 27-year-old Teresa Peroni. Peroni was last seen alive arguing with Sanfratello at a party before they walked into the woods together. The case went cold for decades until it was reopened in 2024, when investigators used modern forensic testing and re-interviewed witnesses. A skull found in 1994 near where she disappeared was definitively identified as Peroni's, leading a grand jury to indict Sanfratello. The arrest highlights the potential for new technology to bring resolution to long-unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England, including London, as severe thunderstorms are expected to bring torrential rain and potential flash flooding. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning, with the dry, parched ground from a recent heatwave increasing the risk of fast-flowing surface water. The severe weather is likely to cause significant disruption to transport, power outages, and flooding of homes and businesses.

          <p>This article examines the nutritional differences between bison and beef, concluding both can be part of a healthy diet depending on individual health goals. Nutrition experts note that bison is a leaner choice, offering fewer calories, less total and saturated fat, and lower cholesterol than beef, making it beneficial for heart health and weight management. Conversely, beef's higher fat and calorie content can be advantageous for growing children, athletes, or those needing to gain weight. While bison has slightly more protein, beef is often more affordable, accessible, and available in a wider variety of cuts for different cooking styles.</p>

The measures include a lower, dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on future transactions via the Nord Stream pipelines, and an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the EU has sanctioned more Russian banks and numerous non-EU shipping vessels in Russia's "shadow fleet."

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that U.S. consumers' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with expectations falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The July survey showed the one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary. The overall consumer sentiment index also rose slightly, indicating a modest improvement in economic confidence despite ongoing price pressures and economic uncertainty.</p>
