          <p>Instagram's new "Map" feature, which allows users to share their real-time location, has sparked controversy among privacy experts over potential safety risks. While Meta, Instagram's parent company, states the feature is opt-in and off by default, critics argue users may not fully understand their privacy settings. Experts are particularly concerned about the risks for younger users, citing social pressures and the potential for stalking or harassment. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between social connectivity features and the protection of personal data on social media platforms.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China, has identified geopolitics as the primary challenge to academic freedom and international scientific collaboration. Xi Youmin stated that global divisions, driven by conflicts and trade wars, are increasingly permeating university campuses and research environments. He argues that political pressures are forcing universities to make abnormal concessions, thereby stifling open inquiry. To counteract this, he suggests that China should ease visa restrictions for foreign students and visitors to foster better international understanding and cooperation.</p>

He posted a photo of his promotion certificate with the caption, "It’s them good jeans," alluding to the ad's play on words between "genes" and "jeans" that drew some online criticism. The post was met with supportive and amused comments from followers, injecting a moment of levity into the debate.

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes diplomatic relations and mutual respect for territorial integrity. A key component of the agreement is the creation of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, named after President Trump, which grants the U.S. exclusive development rights. The accord is seen as a significant geopolitical development, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to occupy Gaza City, a move largely opposed by the Israeli military establishment and public but pushed by Prime Minister Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners. This analysis suggests Netanyahu's decision is primarily driven by his reliance on these hard-right parties for his political survival, as losing their support could trigger an election he is projected to lose. While Netanyahu has publicly stated the occupation would be temporary, his actions appear to align with his coalition's goals, creating a significant disconnect between his government's policy and the desires of the Israeli majority.</p>

          <p>Shares of rare earth miner MP Materials rose over 4% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics, and the production increase signals progress toward profitability. The positive results follow a major investment from the Department of Defense, which recently purchased $400 million in preferred stock, making the federal government the company's largest shareholder and reinforcing its strategic importance.

          <p>The U.S. government, across both the Biden and Trump administrations, has provided significant federal assistance to bolster the domestic mining and metal refining industries to reduce reliance on foreign materials. An example is a former coal mine in North Dakota being repurposed to process nickel, a critical component for electric vehicle batteries, with the help of a $114 million grant from the Department of Energy. This bipartisan effort, which includes Pentagon involvement via the Defense Production Act, aims to secure domestic supply chains for strategic assets and counter China's dominance in the critical minerals market.</p>

          <p>Health officials in China's Guangdong province are taking drastic measures, reminiscent of COVID-19 tactics, to control the region's largest-ever outbreak of the chikungunya virus. More than 8,000 people have been sickened by the mosquito-borne illness, which causes fever, rash, and severe joint pain. The response includes widespread insecticide fogging and forced hospitalization for positive cases to prevent further spread. While the virus is rarely fatal, the population's lack of immunity has prompted an aggressive public health campaign to contain the outbreak and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds.</p>

          <p>Legal professionals across the U.S. are expressing growing concern over the tactic of ICE agents making arrests inside criminal courthouses. Lawyers and prosecutors argue this practice creates a chilling effect, discouraging not only undocumented defendants but also victims and witnesses from appearing in court for fear of deportation. This fear can impede the legal process, pressure individuals into unfavorable plea deals, and make it harder to prosecute cases.

Author Kelly Corrigan advocates for simple tactics like three-minute dance breaks to music, which she calls the cheapest way to change one's emotional state. Other suggestions include taking phone calls while walking and tidying one's workspace to reset focus. The key insight is to work with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them, treating movement as an integral part of the creative process.</p>

An Israeli defense official stated that such condemnations would not weaken the country's resolve.

          <p>President Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners is fueling concerns among some economists about the risk of stagflation—a period of high inflation combined with low economic growth. The new import duties, which have raised the effective average tariff rate to its highest point since 1934, could lead to higher consumer prices as businesses pass on costs. Simultaneously, these costs could cause businesses to scale back hiring and investment, potentially slowing down the economy and creating a challenging scenario for Federal Reserve policymakers.
