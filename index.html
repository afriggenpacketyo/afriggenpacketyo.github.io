          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), with a potential bid expected as early as next week. This news caused WBD's stock to surge by over 28%, its best single-day performance ever, while Paramount Skydance shares also rose significantly. A merger would create a media giant, combining assets like CBS, MTV, and Paramount+ with WBD's portfolio, which includes CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio. The potential consolidation reflects a broader trend of transformation in the media industry as companies navigate the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming-dominated consumption.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, reaching an average of 6.35% for a 30-year term, their lowest level in almost a year. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential homebuyers and those considering refinancing to evaluate their financial situations, as the current climate may present a valuable opportunity. However, it also cautions that rates are volatile and there is no guarantee they will fall further, making the decision to act now a calculated risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting bribes, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car, in exchange for her husband's political influence. During sentencing, the judge acknowledged her health issues but emphasized her role as a "central participant" in the conspiracy. Despite her tearful apology in court, where she claimed she blindly followed her husband, the sentence reflects the severity of the corruption case that also led to the former senator's imprisonment.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American projects funded by Tokyo's $550 billion investment until the initial amount is repaid. This investment is a key component of a new trade deal where Japan faces a 15% baseline tariff. After Japan recoups its investment, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., with America receiving 90% and Japan 10%. The funds are intended to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, representing a strategic economic partnership between the two nations.</p>

This leadership change signals a return to the company's foundational strategies, with the new CEO planning to leverage artificial intelligence to simplify home buying and selling.

          <p>Oracle's stock fell by 6% after a record-setting rally, driven by concerns that its explosive growth forecasts are overwhelmingly dependent on a single client, OpenAI. The company's stock had surged 36% following an earnings report that detailed multi-billion-dollar cloud infrastructure contracts and projected a 14-fold revenue expansion by 2030. However, subsequent reports revealed that OpenAI is expected to account for $300 billion of this revenue over five years. This heavy reliance on one customer has tempered investor enthusiasm, raising questions about the sustainability and diversity of Oracle's future growth in the competitive AI infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether classic literature by authors like Goethe should remain central to the school curriculum, or if reading lists should be updated to include more contemporary and diverse voices. Proponents of reform argue that current required texts, dominated by historical white male authors, fail to resonate with a student population where over 25% have an immigrant background. While some educators and student representatives call for more relevant material, others stress the importance of classics for understanding history and developing critical thinking. The discussion highlights a broader challenge within the German education system to balance tradition with the need to reflect modern society.</p>

The lawsuit argues that these actions violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by denying disabled individuals equal access to Uber's services.

          <p>Actress Nina Dobrev and Olympic snowboarder Shaun White have mutually decided to call off their engagement and end their relationship after more than five years together. A source close to the couple confirmed the split was amicable and made with love and respect. The pair began dating in 2019 and became engaged in October of last year after White staged a surprise proposal in New York. They had been living together since the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. In a recent interview, Dobrev had indicated they were in no rush to plan a wedding, preferring to enjoy the engagement phase of their relationship.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has declared that offshore wind energy has no future in the U.S. under the Trump administration, citing high costs and unreliability. Speaking at an energy conference, Burgum confirmed the administration's intent to halt the industry's development, a stance initiated by President Trump's executive order barring new leases. The Department of the Interior is now reviewing five major offshore wind farms already under construction, with one project by Danish company Orsted already ordered to stop work due to national security concerns. This policy marks a significant reversal from previous efforts to develop renewable energy sources in federal waters.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the assassination of Charlie Kirk as a symptom of a worsening cycle of political violence in the United States. The author contrasts the reactions of those calling for calm and unity with others on social media who are declaring war and demonizing political opponents. While acknowledging the dangerous rise in violent acts, the piece argues that most Americans do not desire a civil war and are attached to the stability of daily life. It concludes by urging leaders and citizens to reject incendiary rhetoric and unequivocally condemn all political violence to prevent further escalation and preserve democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including prominent activists and journalists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange for the releases, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. Authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko framed the release as a humanitarian gesture aimed at rebuilding trade relations, which could include reopening the U.S. embassy in Minsk. While this marks a step towards diplomatic engagement, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in Belarus following widespread protests in 2020.</p>

          <p>Several NATO countries, including the Netherlands, Czech Republic, and France, are deploying troops, air defense systems, and fighter jets to Poland to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank. The move comes after multiple armed Russian drones violated Polish airspace and were subsequently shot down, an act Poland described as an unprecedented provocation. The incident has heightened regional tensions, especially as it coincides with major joint military exercises between Russia and Belarus. In response, Poland is closing its border with Belarus and has called for a UN Security Council meeting to address the incursion.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a controversial rule change to streamline the confirmation process for President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees, a move Democrats have warned against as going "nuclear." The proposal would allow for nominees to be considered in groups, bypassing the individual delays that have stalled many appointments. Majority Leader John Thune argues the change is necessary to overcome Democratic obstruction and allow the president to staff his administration effectively. Democrats, however, contend that Republicans are weakening the Senate's deliberative role and have urged them to reconsider a bipartisan nominations deal that was previously rejected by the White House.</p>

          <h2>Inflation Data Shows President Trump's Tariffs Are Beginning to Impact Consumer Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent inflation data indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising prices for a range of consumer goods, including apparel, electronics, and groceries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report for August showed price increases in several tariff-sensitive categories at a time when the labor market is showing signs of weakness. While administration officials have maintained that tariffs would not drive inflation, economists note that the price hikes are squeezing middle-class consumers. This stagflationary environment presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it weighs potential interest rate cuts to support a slowing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Based on the latest inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would be a modest increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. While higher than this year's increase, the projection is well below the record-high COLAs seen in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was surging. The official COLA will be announced in October, but retirees remain concerned that rising costs for essentials like Medicare premiums could outpace the adjustment to their benefits.

          <p>Health care inflation is accelerating, with medical care costs rising 4.2% annually in August, outpacing the overall inflation rate of 2.9%. This trend is driving up health insurance premiums and is projected to cause the largest increase in health spending for large employers in 15 years. Costs for doctor's visits and hospital services have jumped, while expensive prescription drugs, particularly for cancer and obesity, remain major drivers of spending. As a result, both consumers on ACA exchanges and employees with corporate plans may face higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

This project is widely condemned internationally because it would effectively divide the West Bank and isolate East Jerusalem, which Palestinians envision as their future capital.

The raid targeted a facility under construction on the Hyundai auto plant campus, a project previously hailed as a major economic development for the state. The incident prompted South Korea's president to call for improvements to the U.S. visa system, warning that Korean companies might hesitate to make future investments.
