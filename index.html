          <p>WhatsApp is facing scrutiny over its new AI feature, Meta AI, which is embedded in the messaging service and cannot be turned off, prompting privacy concerns from users. While WhatsApp maintains that the feature is "entirely optional" and can only access messages shared with it, critics argue that it could be a privacy violation and that Meta is exploiting its market position. Concerns have been raised about Meta's data collection practices and the use of personal data to train AI models. The Information Commissioner's Office has stated it will monitor Meta AI's technology and its use of personal data within WhatsApp.</p>

          <p>Fox News commentator David Marcus proposes stringent measures to discourage illegal immigration, including hefty fines for employers who knowingly or unknowingly hire undocumented workers, and the elimination of all federal benefits for those residing in the country illegally. He argues that while courts may hinder deportation efforts, the government can still make it economically unsustainable for undocumented individuals to remain. Marcus draws a contrast with the Ellis Island era, where immigrants received no federal aid, emphasizing self-reliance and community support. The measures aim to disincentivize illegal immigration and shift the burden of support away from the state. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen with intellectual disabilities, was detained by Customs and Border Protection agents in Arizona for 10 days, sparking controversy.

Hermosillo's parents say he wandered away from his girlfriend's home in Tucson, where he was visiting, leading to his arrest.

          <p>The United States is reportedly intensifying its diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, with talks occurring in London and a U.S. envoy scheduled to meet with President Putin in Moscow. The US has proposed a ceasefire along current lines, with Russia potentially conceding control over parts of eastern Ukraine in exchange for de facto recognition of occupied territories and Crimea, and a guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO. However, President Zelensky has stated that Ukraine would never concede that Crimea is Russian territory, and European powers have voiced disagreement with Russian sovereignty over Crimea, making the success of the proposal unlikely.</p>

          <p>China's National Health Commission (NHC) has accused the U.S. of fabricating the theory that COVID-19 originated from a Wuhan laboratory, asserting that it has "no scientific basis." This response follows the Trump administration's updated COVID-19 website promoting the lab leak theory, which claims the virus has a "biological characteristic that is not found in nature." The NHC maintains that evidence suggests an earlier appearance of COVID-19 in the United States and urges the U.S. to cease its smear campaign against China and address its own issues.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 71 percent drop in first-quarter profits, leading CEO Elon Musk to blame organized protests against his political activities and role at DOGE. Musk announced he will reduce his time at DOGE to focus on Tesla, acknowledging the impact of his distractions on the company's performance. The company faces challenges, including declining sales in the U.S. and Europe due to Musk's political stances, increasing competition from other EV brands, and the rise of advanced electric vehicles in China.

The cuts will affect over 80% of the 100,000-plus refugees living in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, with adult refugees in standard households seeing their monthly allowance reduced to roughly one-fifth of its previous level.
