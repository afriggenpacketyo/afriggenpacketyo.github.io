        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding between traditional pretax and after-tax Roth 401(k) contributions can be complex, and financial planners suggest looking beyond simple marginal tax rates. While many weigh their current versus expected future tax brackets, it is more practical to consider one's effective tax rate in retirement, which is often much lower than anticipated. A single person with a $200,000 income might be in the 24% marginal bracket but have an effective tax rate of only 18.5%. This distinction is crucial, as pretax contributions could be more advantageous if a lower effective tax rate is expected during retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

Ben Ami explains that seeing television reports of Israelis fighting for the hostages' release gave him hope to survive. Now free, he says he feels like he is still a hostage in his soul and cannot truly live until the remaining 48 captives are returned home, urging all sides to compromise for peace.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025 in September, experts anticipate that home equity loan and HELOC interest rates will continue to fall in October. The market is already pricing in expectations of another Fed rate cut later this month, which would further lower borrowing costs for homeowners. Financial experts note that while variable-rate HELOCs will see more immediate reductions, fixed-rate home equity loan rates will also likely trend downward more gradually. This environment could present a timely opportunity for homeowners looking to tap into their home's equity for more affordable financing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, led to significant flight delays at several airports, including those in Denver, Newark, and Burbank. Federal data indicates that more air traffic control facilities are now flagged for low staffing than at any point since the summer of 2022. Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers and are expected to work without pay during the shutdown, which has led to a slight increase in sick calls. The situation highlights the fragility of the aviation system amid a national shortage of these critical safety professionals.</p>

As the mayor of Foumban and chair of the Democratic Union for Cameroon party, Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress." to lead the nation into a new era. Despite facing disparaging remarks from competitors, she has gained the support of a dozen former presidential candidates who are urging the divided opposition to unite behind her.

The hearing will likely focus on accusations that the Trump administration is weaponizing the Justice Department to target political opponents, such as the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Lawmakers are also expected to press Bondi on the administration's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, amid accusations of a cover-up.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case involving Colorado's 2019 law that bans licensed mental health professionals from practicing "conversion therapy" on minors. The challenge was brought by a Christian counselor, Kaley Chiles, who argues the law violates her free speech rights by censoring conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from a harmful and ineffective practice. The case could have significant implications for states' ability to regulate the healthcare profession and the scope of First Amendment protections for therapists.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, analysts suggest that an upcoming military pay date on October 15 could be a critical event forcing a compromise between the White House and Congress. The prospect of 1.3 million active-duty service members missing a paycheck is seen as a significant political risk that neither party may be willing to take. Goldman Sachs economists predict the shutdown will likely end by mid-October due to this pressure.

To secure the best possible rates, financial experts advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s.

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass by sending her numerous disturbing items over a four-year period. The man, Peter Windsor, sent packages to the Classic FM studios that included a gun, handcuffs, and a police uniform. During the trial, Ms. Klass described her "sheer terror" upon learning about the escalating nature of the items. Windsor, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, also targeted fellow presenter Katie Breathwick. He is scheduled to be sentenced next month, with options including prison or a hospital order.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya has clarified that her legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules is far from over, despite recent reports suggesting otherwise. Semenya, who has a difference of sexual development (DSD) resulting in higher natural testosterone levels, stated that she is still deciding on the next steps with her legal team. She criticized the governing body's regulations, which require DSD athletes to medically lower their testosterone, as discriminatory and a sign of "weak leadership." Semenya emphasized that she is committed to fighting to ensure that all athletes are protected and treated fairly.</p>

          <p>Glenn Medical Center, the only hospital serving 28,000 residents in a rural Northern California county, has been forced to close after 75 years. The closure occurred after the federal government eliminated its "critical access" designation, a status that provides enhanced funding to ensure healthcare access in remote areas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services determined the hospital no longer met the 35-mile distance requirement from the next nearest facility. The shutdown leaves tens of thousands of people without a local emergency room, forcing them to travel over 30 miles for urgent medical care.</p>

          <p>With the Bureau of Labor Statistics shuttered due to the government shutdown, investment firm Carlyle has released proprietary data indicating that U.S. employment growth was nearly flat in September. The analysis showed a gain of just 17,000 jobs, which would be lower than the modest 22,000 gain reported for August. This figure aligns with other private-sector data suggesting a significant hiring slowdown. Despite the weak employment numbers, Carlyle's data also indicated underlying economic strength, with GDP growth running at a 2.7% annualized pace and a notable acceleration in business investment.

The company also noted a trend of lower demand among Hispanic consumers, which it attributes to concerns over the current administration's immigration policies and potential job losses.

This environmental challenge has become a key test for the country as it pursues European Union membership, with environmental reform being one of the most complex and costly requirements for accession.

          <p>CNN's chief White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins, has shared insights from Trump administration staffers about the challenges of traveling with the president. According to Collins, the most dreaded aspect is that President Trump "does not sleep" and is constantly active. She recounted hearing from aides that the president will have staff woken up if he wants to talk, leading to exhaustion, particularly on long international trips. A Fox News producer reportedly shared a similar experience, stating that their staff is working double-time because the president's schedule is relentless, disrupting their own sleep patterns.</p>

While Pride events proceeded in Hanoi, the move is seen by some as part of a broader clampdown on civil society under the new leadership of Communist Party General Secretary To Lam. Analysts suggest the government may fear youth-led protests, similar to those seen elsewhere in Asia. The cancellations mark a worrying shift for a country that had previously made strides, such as declaring that homosexuality is not an illness.</p>
