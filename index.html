          <p>German startup DeepL is now utilizing Nvidia's latest chips to drastically reduce the time required to translate the entire internet, decreasing it from 194 days to just 18 days. DeepL, which develops its own AI models, competes with services like Google Translate. The deployment of Nvidia's DGX SuperPOD system, containing 36 B200 Grace Blackwell Superchips per server rack, will provide significantly more computational power for DeepL's research scientists. This infrastructure upgrade aims to enhance products like Clarify, a tool that ensures context is incorporated into translations, pushing the boundaries of what's technically feasible in AI-driven language processing.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles experienced a curfew for the first time since anti-ICE protests began, prompting the Trump administration to deploy Marines and National Guard troops to protect federal facilities, despite objections from state and city officials. NPR's Up First newsletter also details the potential legal implications of this deployment, referencing Posse Comitatus, a law barring the military from acting as police within the United States. Separately, an appeal hearing is scheduled for Trump's criminal conviction involving hush money payments. NPR is also dedicating a week to climate solutions, including home insurance challenges and the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitors for health management.</p>

          <p>Protests have spread across numerous U.S. cities, including Boston, Houston, and Philadelphia, following demonstrations in Los Angeles against federal immigration raids. The unrest was sparked by the arrest of unauthorized immigrants in areas with large Latino populations, leading to rallies nationwide. In response to planned demonstrations, Texas Governor Greg Abbott deployed the state's National Guard to San Antonio, while New York City Mayor Eric Adams deemed similar protests to those in LA as unacceptable. The protests have seen varying levels of intensity, with some cities experiencing peaceful gatherings and others facing violence and arrests, reflecting a widespread concern over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a resurgence in 2025 after a slowdown the previous year, with registrations of electrified vehicles increasing by 20% from January to April. This recovery is partly driven by an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions, incentivizing corporate sales through attractive leasing deals and new EV models. However, consumer skepticism remains, with interest in EVs stagnant and hybrids favored due to charging concerns, and Tesla's sales have declined amidst controversy surrounding CEO Elon Musk. Despite these challenges, Chinese automakers are gaining ground in the European market, underscoring the evolving dynamics of the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a significant increase, rising 12.5% last week to reach the highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This surge occurred despite minimal movement in mortgage interest rates, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increasing slightly to 6.93%. Applications to refinance and purchase homes also rose, driven by increased available listings and easing home prices.
