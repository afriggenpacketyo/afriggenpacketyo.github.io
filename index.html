          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck the Texas Hill Country, leading to what officials are calling a "mass casualty event" with at least 24 reported fatalities. The Guadalupe River surged an astonishing 26 feet in under an hour, causing widespread destruction of property. In addition to the deaths, a major search and rescue operation is underway for over 20 children who are unaccounted for from a local summer camp, Camp Mystic. State and federal resources, including helicopters and drones, have been mobilized to assist in the ongoing recovery efforts amid the catastrophic conditions.</p>

The government's growth guidelines focus on improving production and developing future vessels, such as autonomous and eco-friendly ships. This strategic push aims to re-establish the nation as a global maritime power, creating jobs and driving exports. The initiative comes as both South Korea and Japan are positioned to increase their roles in the industry, particularly as the United States focuses on China's shipbuilding dominance.

          <p>A controversial law in Connecticut that allows towing companies to sell impounded vehicles after just 15 days is facing sharp criticism from residents and advocates. Critics label the practice as predatory, arguing that it disproportionately targets working-class and low-income individuals who cannot afford to pay hundreds of dollars in fees on short notice. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of specifically targeting apartment complexes in these neighborhoods. The company owner defends the practice as a necessary enforcement of parking rules set by the properties.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire has rapidly expanded to over 70,800 acres in San Luis Obispo County, establishing it as the largest wildfire in California so far this year. With only 10% containment, the blaze poses a significant threat, with evacuation orders in effect for over 200 people and 50 structures at risk. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire has prompted a massive response involving more than 600 personnel and numerous air tankers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall within certain income thresholds. Policy experts note that this provides some relief but is misleadingly framed as a full repeal of the tax. The deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just Social Security, and will primarily benefit higher-income seniors rather than those who already pay no federal income tax.

          <p>A new study reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against global warming. These creatures engage in an epic migration in the Antarctic Ocean, consuming carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface and then sinking hundreds of meters deep. As they burn their fat reserves in the deep ocean, they effectively lock away vast amounts of carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. This natural process is now understood to be a much more significant contributor to carbon sequestration than previously thought, highlighting the crucial role of these overlooked animals.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The demonstration was a response to recent widespread raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) across the Southland and the passage of a budget bill that allocates billions more in funding for immigration enforcement. Protesters, including local political leaders, marched to City Hall and the Federal Building, expressing that the increased enforcement has instilled fear and terror in immigrant communities and is disrupting daily life.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a victory over Poland, but the win was tempered by a significant injury concern. Team captain Giulia Gwinn left the pitch in tears during the first half after an apparent knee injury, casting a shadow over the team's performance. Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, and her participation in the remainder of the tournament is now in serious doubt. While goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the win, the potential loss of their captain is a major blow for the eight-time champions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will implement significant changes at America's national parks. The order directs federal agencies to increase entry fees for foreign tourists while aiming to improve affordability and provide preferential treatment for U.S. residents in lotteries or permit systems. In a separate major policy shift, the order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the management and storytelling within the national park system, aligning with the administration's broader move to end government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>Geopolitical friction between India and China continues to pose challenges for Global South-based organizations that require consensus for decision-making. A recent meeting of defense ministers from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) failed to produce a joint statement due to disagreements over language related to terrorism. This event underscores how India can act as a counterbalance to China's influence within alliances like the SCO and BRICS. The inability to reach a consensus highlights the ongoing strategic rivalry between the two regional powers, which can stall collective action.</p>

          <p>A board-certified cardiologist, drawing on two decades of experience treating heart disease, outlines five "toxic" food categories he avoids giving his own children. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and establish unhealthy cravings. The doctor advocates for healthier, home-prepared alternatives like air-popped popcorn and plain yogurt with fresh fruit to promote long-term cardiovascular health.</p>
