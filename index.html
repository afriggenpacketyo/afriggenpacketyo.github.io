          <p>New York Yankees star Aaron Judge has hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone in just 1,088 games. This makes him the fastest player in MLB history to reach this mark, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team victory would have made the moment better. The two-time AL MVP continues to have a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) and UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting are scheduled to meet next week to negotiate a potential end to the ongoing pay dispute. Resident doctors in England have announced a five-day strike starting July 25th, demanding a better pay offer than the current 5.4% increase. The BMA argues that real-term pay has fallen significantly since 2008 and will only call off the strike if a credible new offer is made. The government maintains it cannot improve its current offer, warning that further strikes would be disastrous for patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanis, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a California cannabis farm. Alanis, who was reportedly his family's sole provider in Mexico, fell about 30 feet while allegedly fleeing from agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated Alanis was not being pursued by law enforcement at the time of the fall. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from the United Farm Workers union, which described the federal actions as violent and cruel, highlighting the human cost of such enforcement operations.</p>

The cuts, which affect both civil and foreign service officers, are aimed at streamlining the department and eliminating what the administration calls redundant offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the layoffs will weaken U.S. diplomacy and national security. Several key offices, including those focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and Afghan relocation efforts, have been severely impacted by the staff reductions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on his supporters to stop focusing on the Jeffrey Epstein case, following dissatisfaction from his base over the Justice Department's handling of related files. The administration faced criticism after the DOJ and FBI stated that a rumored client list never existed and that Epstein died by suicide, a conclusion many supporters reject. In a social media post, Trump defended Attorney General Pam Bondi and urged his base to focus on other matters, such as his unsubstantiated claims of a stolen 2020 election.

          <p>Despite recent speculation about resuming production, Boeing's iconic C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft was originally discontinued in 2015 primarily due to a lack of demand and defense budget cuts. The U.S. Air Force had completed its purchase order, and with few remaining international buyers, production was no longer financially viable. The 2011 Budget Control Act led to significant defense spending reductions, making the expensive aircraft a target for cuts. Although renowned for its massive cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways, the high operational costs contributed to its retirement from production.</p>

These companies aim to launch their products within the next few years, targeting consumers looking for alternatives that more closely mimic the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese. However, they face significant hurdles, including high production costs, regulatory approval, and a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales. The success of this novel food will depend on overcoming consumer concerns about price, taste, and the perception of it being an ultra-processed food.</p>

          <p>An official excavation has begun at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where the remains of up to 796 babies and young children are believed to be buried in an unmarked mass grave. The St. Mary's home operated from 1925 to 1961, housing unmarried mothers and their children, who were often separated. The horrific discovery was brought to light by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research uncovered death records for the children but no corresponding burial records. The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a measure of truth and dignity to the victims after decades of secrecy.</p>

The victory was a statement of intent from a Swedish side that has historically fallen short in major tournaments despite consistent high performance. Chelsea midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed confidence that this year's squad has a different quality and can "go the whole way." Having won all three group matches, Sweden now awaits its quarter-final opponent, with players and fans feeling a new level of belief in their chances for the title.</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing federal traffic data from 2019 to 2023 has identified the most dangerous times to drive in the ten most populated U.S. states. The research, by the Frank Santini Law Firm, found that evening hours are overwhelmingly the deadliest, with the 6:00 PM to 6:59 PM window being the most fatal in four of the ten states. In California, the most dangerous hour is 8:00 PM to 8:59 PM, while in Texas, it is 9:00 PM to 9:59 PM. Pennsylvania was the only outlier, with its deadliest hour occurring in the afternoon, between 3:00 PM and 3:59 PM, highlighting the risks associated with rush hour and dusk.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from "indiscriminately" arresting individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The ruling by Judge Maame Frimpong states that there is a "mountain of evidence" that officials have been conducting unconstitutional "roving patrols." The order prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, speaking Spanish, or being present at a specific location. This legal setback for the administration's immigration crackdown comes amid widespread protests and criticism of recent raids in California.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, setting the tone for the Los Angeles Dodgers to end their seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.

Although bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the official win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed. The performance is a promising sign for the two-way superstar's continued recovery and his impact as a pitcher for the team's second half.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence technology advances, it is increasingly seen as a factor contributing to China's declining birth rate by fulfilling needs traditionally met by family, such as companionship and elder care. Many young professionals now feel less pressure to marry and have children, believing AI-powered robots will provide support in their old age. While this trend exacerbates demographic concerns, some experts argue it may not be entirely negative. They suggest that the AI revolution could redefine societal structures around life and family, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete in a technologically advanced future.</p>

Trump labeled O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, a "threat to humanity." Legal experts quickly pointed out that the president has no authority to revoke the citizenship of a native-born American, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling. This is the latest instance of the president threatening to use state power against a political or personal adversary, reigniting debates about executive overreach and constitutional limits.</p>
