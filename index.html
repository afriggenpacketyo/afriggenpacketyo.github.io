          <p>The Federal Reserve's July meeting minutes revealed officials' significant concerns regarding the state of the labor market and persistent inflation, though a majority still agreed it was too soon to lower interest rates. This meeting marked a rare divergence of opinion, with two Fed governors voting against holding rates steady, advocating for immediate cuts—a split not seen in over 30 years. Policymakers specifically noted the uncertain effects of President Trump's tariffs as a central discussion point, citing them as a key upside risk to inflation. These deliberations occurred just before a Bureau of Labor Statistics report confirmed weaker-than-expected payroll growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York, Richard Berman, declined the government's request to unseal grand jury material in the Jeffrey Epstein case, stating prosecutors failed to demonstrate "special circumstances" for their disclosure. The judge noted the material was largely hearsay testimony from a single FBI agent and paled in comparison to the Justice Department's already vast "Epstein Files." Berman emphasized the government's responsibility for comprehensive public disclosure and cited concerns for victims' safety and privacy as reasons to maintain secrecy. This ruling occurs amidst significant public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information about Epstein's alleged sexual assault and associated investigations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is tracking up the Atlantic as a Category 2 storm, threatening North Carolina's Outer Banks with coastal flooding and strong winds, though it is not expected to make U.S. landfall. Evacuation orders have been issued for vulnerable areas like Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, with officials urging residents to act immediately due to life-threatening surf and rip currents. The article details Erin's fluctuating strength, its current 110 mph winds, and its projected path between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda through early Friday. Dangerous storm surge and rough ocean conditions are anticipated across much of the East Coast, leading to swimming prohibitions in several beach communities as a precaution.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for New York Attorney General Letitia James, Abbe Lowell, sharply criticized Department of Justice official Ed Martin for visiting James' Brooklyn residence and publicly calling for her resignation. Lowell described Martin's visit as a "bizarre, made-for-media stunt" intended to prejudice James amidst federal investigations into her. The article notes these probes, one tied to her civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and another regarding mortgage fraud allegations, are viewed by James' camp as clear political retribution. Lowell asserted that the DOJ has firm policies against using prosecutorial power for political ends and that James would not step down from her position.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller faced intense heckling from protesters during a photo opportunity with National Guard troops at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station. The officials, who were thanking the troops and buying them lunch, were met with loud chants of "Free DC" that largely drowned out their remarks to the press. Vance and Miller dismissed the protesters as "crazy" and "communists." The article highlights Vance's justification for troop deployment at the station, claiming it was overrun with homeless people and unsafe, a assertion he declined to support with specific evidence.</p>

          <p>Grants Pass, Oregon, a city central to a major U.S. Supreme Court homelessness ruling, has reached a settlement agreeing to provide at least 150 ADA-compliant camping spaces for unhoused individuals. The agreement stems from a lawsuit by Disability Rights Oregon, which accused the city of discrimination and violating state law requiring "objectively reasonable" camping regulations. This development follows a Supreme Court ruling that allowed cities to criminalize outdoor sleeping even without available shelter. The settlement mandates the availability of drinking water and hand-washing stations at these sites and includes a $60,000 grant for homeless services, marking a significant step towards addressing the city's long-standing homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>At least 50 people were killed in a widespread attack by criminal gangs, known as "bandits," on Muslim communities in Nigeria's Katsina state. Gunmen initially targeted a mosque in Unguwar Mantau, killing around 30 worshippers, before proceeding to other villages where they killed an additional 20 people and burned homes. The article reports that dozens were also kidnapped, with survivors describing harrowing scenes of women and girls being dragged away. This violence is part of a broader trend in northwestern Nigeria, where organized crime, including cattle rustling, kidnappings for ransom, and extortion, has escalated from initial land disputes, exacerbated by limited state presence.</p>

          <p>This article explains the common reasons why homeowners might not qualify for a reverse mortgage, a popular option for seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments. Key disqualifying factors include not meeting the age requirement (generally 62 for HECM, with implications for younger spouses), insufficient home equity (less than 50%), and existing mortgage balances that the reverse mortgage cannot cover. Property type and condition restrictions, such as FHA standards for structural integrity and habitability, also play a crucial role. Additionally, issues with credit and financial assessments, like unresolved bankruptcies or insufficient income to cover property expenses, can lead to denial, as can failing to complete mandatory counseling.</p>

          <p>A newly emerged image appears to show a very large, low-observable, flying-wing aircraft in flight over China, matching descriptions of a huge drone previously identified in satellite imagery. The rear-aspect photo reveals landing gear and B-2-style split rudders, consistent with takeoff or landing. While its exact identity is unconfirmed, the article suggests it is likely a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) stealth drone, similar to the purported U.S. RQ-180. This development underscores China's rapidly accelerating next-generation air combat programs and its ambition to field large, stealthy flying-wing designs as part of its future military ecosystem, possibly influencing projects like the H-20 bomber.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the critical strategic importance of Donetsk for Ukraine's defenses, especially as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly seeks to freeze the war along current front lines in exchange for the surrender of the remaining region. Ukraine still controls about 6,600 sq km of Donetsk, including major urban centers, which form part of a heavily fortified "fortress belt" built over 11 years with trenches, bunkers, and minefields. Analysts emphasize the terrain's defensibility, particularly high ground like Chasiv Yar, which is crucial for observation and coordinating artillery. For Ukraine, relinquishing western Donetsk would mean a grievous loss of land and a vital bulwark against future Russian advances.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares have plummeted 20% from recent highs, entering bear market territory after six consecutive days of heavy selling—its longest losing streak since April 2024. This significant drop follows a broader market sell-off and a critical short seller report from Citron Research, which deemed the company "detached from fundamentals and analysis," suggesting a much lower valuation. While Palantir had previously surged to record highs this year, becoming a top U.S. tech firm due to the AI boom and government contracts, the article notes that even with the recent decline, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 193 times indicates shares remain expensive compared to peers.</p>

The U.S. Department of Education halted loan discharge on IBR while responding to recent court actions impacting the Biden administration-era SAVE plan, which previously counted certain forbearance periods towards forgiveness. This freeze is a significant setback for 1.97 million federal student loan borrowers, especially those nearing their 20 or 25-year forgiveness timeline.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new type of cell in Burmese pythons' intestines that enables them to completely digest the skeletons of their prey, even large animals like deer. This finding, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, explains why no bone fragments are excreted. Professor Jehan-Hervé Lignot identified these specialized cells, which manage the absorption and excretion of excess calcium and phosphorus from the consumed bones. The article notes that while pythons are an invasive species in Florida, posing a threat to native wildlife, this biological adaptation highlights their remarkable digestive capabilities, shared with other large snakes like boa constrictors and the Gila monster.</p>
