          <p>Following a deadly Russian strike on Kyiv that killed at least nine and injured dozens, President Trump publicly called on Vladimir Putin to cease attacks. Trump expressed disapproval of the strikes, citing their bad timing amidst ongoing negotiations to end the war, with White House officials reportedly pressuring Ukraine to consider ceding territory. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, currently in South Africa, is returning to Ukraine early. The Russian military confirmed the strike, stating they targeted military and near-military targets, but Ukraine's Ministry of Defense condemned the attacks as evidence that Russia is not seeking peace.

          <p>As of April 24, 2025, the price of gold is $3,336.72 per ounce, influenced by supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and as a hedge against inflation. The price of gold can fluctuate in the short term, so it's important to keep an eye on these changes if you want to buy gold at the right time.

          <p>Orders for durable goods in March saw a significant increase of 9.2%, driven by companies accelerating purchases of big-ticket items like autos and appliances to avoid President Trump's impending tariffs on U.S. imports. Transportation equipment orders led the surge, particularly in nondefense aircraft and parts. While this increase suggests a pull-forward effect, a Federal Reserve report indicated broader apprehension about economic conditions due to the tariffs.

          <p>Germany's economy is facing significant challenges, including the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs, which are expected to hinder growth. While a new government is set to take power with promises to spur growth through increased spending, economists warn that underlying structural issues, such as bureaucracy and high energy prices, need to be addressed. Companies are scaling back their growth outlooks as they assess the impact of the 10 percent blanket tariff on goods exported to the United States. The country is also grappling with a shrinking workforce and rising anti-immigrant sentiment, making it difficult to attract skilled foreign workers. Optimism Score: 30</p>
