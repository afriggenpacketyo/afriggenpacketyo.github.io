          <p>Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago, has been apprehended in New Orleans. The jailbreak, described by Louisiana's governor as the worst in recent state history, has brought intense scrutiny upon Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who attributes the escape to poor facility infrastructure. With Massey's capture, only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, remains at large, and authorities have arrested over a dozen individuals for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Haitian migrants, effective September 2. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits for approximately 348,000 Haitians, who have been protected since the 2010 earthquake. The Department of Homeland Security argues that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return, a stance that contrasts with the State Department's own Level 4 travel advisory warning Americans against visiting due to severe violence and instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques major automobile manufacturers for their disproportionately low advertising investment in the Hispanic market, despite this demographic's significant and growing purchasing power. The author argues that this constitutes "economic racism," citing data showing that brands like Hyundai and General Motors spend a very small fraction of their ad budgets on Spanish-language media, even though Hispanics account for a substantial percentage of their sales. The piece suggests that this neglect is a missed opportunity, as Hispanic consumers are loyal and increasingly purchasing luxury and high-end vehicles.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Justice Department report has revealed that a hacker working for the Sinaloa drug cartel successfully targeted an FBI official in Mexico City in 2018. The hacker obtained the official's phone records, including call logs and location data, and utilized the city's public surveillance camera system to track their movements. This information was then used by the cartel to identify, intimidate, and in some cases, kill potential FBI informants, highlighting the growing threat of technical surveillance being exploited by criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Despite Prime Minister Keir Starmer making concessions on controversial welfare reforms, many Labour backbench MPs remain angry and bruised by the process. The government agreed to apply stricter benefit criteria only to new claimants, pacifying some but not all of the rebels who feel the changes are still flawed. The internal conflict has exposed deep frustrations within the party, with some MPs feeling that Downing Street views them as an inconvenience to be managed rather than listened to.</p>

Officials emphasized that the parched vegetation has created a tinderbox, making another season of destructive fires "inevitable." They urged residents to prepare by clearing flammable materials from their properties and having evacuation plans ready, noting that the return of Santa Ana winds will soon exacerbate the danger.</p>
