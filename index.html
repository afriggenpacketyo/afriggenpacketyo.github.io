          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing at an ICE detention facility while protesting its operation without proper city permits. Accompanied by three Democratic members of Congress, Baraka allegedly ignored warnings from Homeland Security Investigations. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the protesters "stormed the gate," while city officials claim the facility lacks necessary permits and inspections. New Jersey's Governor Phil Murphy expressed outrage over Baraka's arrest and demanded his immediate release, underscoring the political tensions surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is predicted to re-enter the atmosphere soon. Experts are uncertain about the exact time and location of re-entry, but it is expected to occur within a specific latitude range. Despite the spacecraft's heat shield, some pieces may survive the descent, potentially landing on Earth. While the risk of injury is low, the event is being closely monitored, and any recovered fragments would legally belong to Russia, highlighting the complexities of space law and debris management.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against consuming mussels harvested along the California coastline. Biotoxins accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms, making them poisonous to humans, and cooking does not eliminate the risk. Commercially grown mussels are exempt due to regular testing, but officials advise caution and recommend removing digestive organs from clams and scallops before consumption.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests a correlation between left-handedness and certain neurological conditions, indicating that left-handed individuals are more likely to have diagnoses such as autism and schizophrenia. Researchers analyzed data from over 200,000 people, finding that atypical handedness may be associated with language-related disorders like dyslexia. Neurologists emphasize that the findings are purely correlational and do not imply causation, as being left-handed does not guarantee the development of these conditions. The study aims to help experts understand how brains are organized and how they develop.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington as documents related to his abandoned federal corruption case were released. Adams stated he discussed New York City priorities, including infrastructure projects, while Trump suggested Adams came to thank him. The released documents revealed investigations into potential witness tampering by Adams. The meeting occurred after the Justice Department dropped the case, leading to resignations from prosecutors. The trip coincides with sensitive issues between the city and the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller argued the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus. The Constitution allows suspension in extraordinary circumstances like invasion or rebellion. This move would significantly curtail due process rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs policy has significantly impacted the port of Long Beach, with traffic down by a third compared to last year due to frozen trade between the U.S. and China. This decline translates to fewer ships, containers, and jobs, affecting local lorry drivers and industries dependent on Chinese imports. Shortages and price hikes are already taking hold, with some businesses facing empty shelves. The U.S. trade secretary is scheduled to meet with his Chinese counterpart to address the growing pressure to strike a deal.</p>

The tariffs are hurting both countries, with China experiencing a hit to factory output and the U.S. facing economic contraction and uncertainty. Both sides are under pressure to reassure nervous markets and domestic constituencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on demand, foreign suppliers, and government support. Tariffs could hurt the aerospace industry, which relies heavily on global suppliers. Boeing, RTX, and GE Aerospace have already estimated significant tariff costs this year. Governments have historically used tariffs and subsidies to protect their aviation industries.</p>

          <p>U.S. military aid to Ukraine has been stalled for 120 days, exceeding a previous hold by Speaker Mike Johnson.

President Zelensky faced verbal abuse from Trump and Vice President Vance during a White House meeting. As a result, Ukraine is relying more on European allies and building its own defense industry.
