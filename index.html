          <p>The latest round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas has faltered, with U.S. and Israeli teams being recalled from Doha. The Trump administration has stepped back, stating that Hamas did not seem to want a deal. This collapse in talks occurs as the humanitarian situation in Gaza becomes increasingly dire, with the World Food Program reporting that a third of the population has gone days without food. The failure to reach an agreement prolongs the severe suffering of over 2 million Palestinians in the region.</p>

          <p>Convicted Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was questioned about roughly 100 different people during a two-day meeting with a high-ranking Department of Justice official. Her lawyer stated that she answered every question truthfully and did not hold anything back, describing her as a "scapegoat." The meeting has fueled speculation about potential cooperation for a sentence reduction, though her attorney confirmed no offers have been made. The development comes as the Trump administration faces pressure regarding the release of Epstein-related files.</p>

          <p>In response to images of masked federal agents conducting immigration arrests, Democratic lawmakers have introduced bills to make the practice illegal. The proposed "No Secret Police Act" would bar federal agents from concealing their faces with non-tactical masks, an action supporters say is necessary to maintain transparency and democratic norms. While unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Congress, similar legislation is advancing at the state level in California and New York. The debate centers on balancing officer safety against public accountability and trust in law enforcement.</p>

This contrasts with more optimistic tones from Canadian officials, who have described talks as productive but emphasized they will not rush into a "bad deal." The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on various Canadian goods, and failure to reach an agreement could result in further taxes.</p>
