          <p>Kenya is experiencing continued unrest after violent anti-government protests, leading to business closures and roadblocks in several cities. The demonstrations, largely driven by youth frustrated with economic hardship and corruption, have resulted in numerous arrests and several deaths. President William Ruto has issued a stern warning against further unconstitutional actions, while critics accuse the government of an authoritarian response and of being tone-deaf to the public's grievances. The leaderless nature of the "Gen Z" protests contributes to the situation's volatility.</p>

          <p>An additional 50 people have come forward with misconduct claims against TV presenter Gregg Wallace, who was recently sacked from "MasterChef." The new allegations, which he denies, range from inappropriate comments to sexual assault. In response to Wallace's public defense, senior figures like Baroness Helena Kennedy and the head of the Bectu union have warned him against dismissing the women's claims. An independent inquiry into the initial allegations is expected to release its findings soon.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire raging on the northern edge of Marseille, France, has injured at least 110 people and forced the evacuation of hundreds of residents. The blaze, which authorities believe was started by a car fire, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions, covering approximately 700 hectares. While firefighters are gaining ground, the fire is not yet fully contained, and Marseille's airport experienced significant disruptions. President Emmanuel Macron has expressed support for the emergency crews battling the "apocalyptic" scene.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has denied a media report claiming it supplied Iran with air defense systems following a recent truce between Iran and Israel. A Middle East Eye story, citing an anonymous Arab official, alleged that China had provided the military equipment in exchange for oil shipments. The Chinese embassy in Israel issued a statement rejecting the claim, asserting that China does not export weapons to countries involved in active warfare and maintains strict non-proliferation controls.

          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's move to revoke birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen immigrants, drawing comparisons to historical policies, including those of Nazi Germany. While Nazi Germany revoked citizenship from Jewish people based on race, Germany's laws were historically based on blood right, not birthright. In contrast, the U.S. enshrined birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment to grant rights to formerly enslaved people. The piece notes that while critics label the move authoritarian, unrestricted birthright citizenship is rare among industrialized nations, with the U.S. and Canada being notable exceptions.</p>

A recent government announcement to expand free school meal eligibility is welcomed, but without a significant funding increase, the quality of meals for the nation's most vulnerable children will continue to decline.</p>

          <p>This article explains the concept of branded residences, which are high-end properties associated with luxury brands like hotels, car manufacturers, or fashion labels. Owners purchase these homes but can access hotel-style services such as concierge, housekeeping, and spa facilities for additional fees. The market, popular with high-net-worth individuals, is expanding globally, particularly in Miami and Dubai, with brands like Four Seasons and Ferrari entering the space. While the brand association provides a sense of security, buyers pay a premium and must be aware of the specific terms of the licensing agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intelligence officials across Europe are warning that Russia is escalating a campaign of sabotage, using proxies to carry out arson and other disruptive acts. A recent arson attack on a London warehouse storing supplies for Ukraine, allegedly organized by a Russian handler, is cited as a key example. Officials express growing concern that these plots, often carried out by young, amateur recruits for small payments, are becoming more violent and risk causing serious injury or death. The campaign represents a shift in Russian tactics since many of its professional spies were expelled from Western countries.</p>

          <p>China has completed a 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, a key part of its "green great wall" project aimed at halting desertification. The new belt connects and stabilizes the edges of the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project utilizes methods like straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by the planting of drought-resistant vegetation. This massive ecological engineering effort is designed to create an effective barrier against sandstorms and protect arable land, demonstrating China's large-scale approach to environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his approval for sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move he had previously resisted. During a cabinet meeting, Trump also expressed that he was "not happy" with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting a potential strain in their relationship. The article questions the reasons behind this sudden change in stance on military aid for Ukraine. This development comes as Trump also continues diplomatic engagements, including hosting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>According to a Fox News Digital report citing Justice Department sources, a criminal investigation has been opened into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan. The probe is reportedly focused on their involvement in the 2016 Russia interference investigation, including allegations of making false statements to Congress. The investigation into Brennan was reportedly initiated after a referral from then-CIA Director John Ratcliffe. This development signifies a major turn in the long-running political and legal battles surrounding the origins of the Russia probe.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce.

          <p>A Tunisian court has handed down lengthy prison sentences to opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi and 20 other political figures in a mass trial. Ghannouchi, leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, received a 14-year term on charges that his defense team calls baseless and politically motivated. The crackdown is part of a broader trend under President Kais Saied, who dissolved parliament in 2021 and has since consolidated power. Critics argue these actions are undermining the democratic gains made since the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, just two days before a catastrophic flood killed more than two dozen people, mostly children. Despite weather service warnings of potential flooding, the camp did not relocate its 650 campers and staff from the low-lying area along the Guadalupe River. While records show the camp's written plan met state regulations, the details of the plan and the camp's preparedness are now under intense scrutiny.

Court documents allege that Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine facilitated the sale of an SKS rifle to Routh, who was a convicted felon and thus prohibited from owning a firearm. Routh was later found with a similar weapon outside Trump's Florida golf club. The defendants claimed they had no prior knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.</p>

          <p>Hydrologists and historical records indicate that the deadly flash flood on Texas's Guadalupe River was a known and foreseeable risk. The area, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has a long history of major flooding events, with the river having crested at similar or higher levels in the past. Experts at the National Weather Service had recognized the potential for a significant event and issued a flash flood watch hours before the disaster struck. The tragedy highlights the immense challenge of communicating warnings effectively, especially for overnight storms in densely populated recreational areas.</p>
