          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed dozens of buildings, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The fire, which has expanded to thousands of acres, also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that complicated firefighting efforts. While all guests and employees were evacuated safely, the loss of the iconic 1930s lodge and other facilities represents a significant blow to the national park. The event is compounded by other fires in the region and widespread smoke from Canadian wildfires affecting the U.S. Midwest.</p>

          <h2>Bank of England Signals Readiness for Interest Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 02:29:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Governor of the Bank of England has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market continues to weaken. Citing a slowdown in hiring and smaller pay increases, the governor expressed a belief that the path for interest rates is downwards from the current 4.25%. This stance is reinforced by recent data showing a decline in job vacancies and an economic contraction in May. The comments suggest a rate cut could occur as soon as the Bank's next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has achieved a new record price, surging past the $120,000 mark on Monday. The rally is largely attributed to substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with one recent day logging over $1.18 billion in new investments. Market optimism is also fueled by expectations of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, including potential legislation around stablecoins. Analysts suggest that continued institutional buying could propel the cryptocurrency's price even higher in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts and showing resilience despite global trade tensions. This growth was supported by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets, particularly Southeast Asia and the European Union, and a temporary tariff reprieve that slowed the decline in exports to America. Imports also saw their first year-over-year increase in 2025, climbing 1.1%, although this was slightly below expectations. While the data provides a short-term boost, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year due to ongoing tariff uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sought to alleviate U.S. fears that the company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China's military cannot rely on U.S. technology because its access could be restricted at any time. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive and that engaging with China's large developer community is essential for maintaining America's global leadership in AI.

          <p>China's leadership is indicating a policy shift to address "excessive competition," a phenomenon known locally as 'neijuan' that leads to diminishing returns. President Xi Jinping recently chaired a meeting that called for regulating disorderly, low-price competition and guiding the exit of outdated production capacity. This move echoes the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" but occurs in a different economic context with weaker growth and a larger role for private firms. Analysts are watching to see how Beijing will tackle this issue, which has become a significant challenge for the domestic economy.</p>

The article also explores how the understaffing of agencies like the National Weather Service, following cuts under the Trump administration, may have hampered warning and coordination efforts.

          <p>London is facing questions about its long-term appeal as it contends with an exodus of millionaires, high living costs, and businesses choosing to list on foreign stock exchanges. Some market analysts argue the city's "buzz" has faded due to over-regulation and political instability, diminishing its status as a global financial hub. However, other economists are more optimistic, pointing to London's fundamental strengths like the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a strong services export sector. They suggest the city is experiencing intense competition but can adapt through targeted improvements rather than a complete reinvention.</p>

To eradicate the beetles, workers are placing the books in oxygen-free nitrogen environments for several weeks.

At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that properties were deliberately overvalued to attract sellers, who were later pressured into price reductions.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called for closer cooperation with China on developing "green steel" during a visit to Shanghai. Speaking before a meeting between Australian iron ore miners and Chinese steelmakers, Albanese framed the decarbonization of the steel industry as a mutual opportunity. China is the largest consumer of Australian iron ore, but the shift to green steel production, which requires higher-grade ore, puts this trade relationship at risk. The proposal aims to evolve the economic partnership by focusing on new, lower-emissions technologies like green iron.</p>

          <p>A push by the Trump administration to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is raising concerns that rural communities could be the most affected. While the president has targeted outlets like NPR and PBS for alleged bias, over 70% of federal funding is distributed to local stations, many of which are in rural areas and rely heavily on these grants. For some remote stations, such as the one in Kotzebue, Alaska, public funding is a lifeline that supports essential news and emergency broadcasts. Republican senators from rural states have expressed opposition, creating uncertainty over whether the cuts will pass.</p>
