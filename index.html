          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence compute infrastructure, aiming to build the industry's most elite research team. The company's first AI supercluster, named Prometheus, is scheduled to come online in 2026, with several other multi-gigawatt clusters in development. This major investment follows a lukewarm reception to Meta's Llama 4 AI models and is part of a strategic revamp to better compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race for superintelligence.</p>

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields, long-term CDs can generate substantially greater total returns over time due to the extended earning period. For example, a five-year CD at 4.20% on a $5,000 deposit could earn over $1,140, significantly more than the $220 earned on a one-year CD at 4.40%. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major wildfire at the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a beloved landmark built in the 1930s. The Dragon Bravo Fire exhibited extreme behavior, forcing evacuations and also destroying a water treatment facility, which caused a hazardous chlorine gas leak. Officials are now facing questions over their initial fire management strategy, as the loss of the iconic lodge is being mourned as a devastating blow to Arizona's state history.</p>

          <p>An asteroid designated 2025 MA90 is scheduled to fly past Earth on Tuesday at a safe distance of over six million kilometers. An article humorously quantifies the asteroid's estimated 88.8-meter diameter as equivalent to the height of 145 Elmos, referencing a "Sesame Street" segment where the character was measured. While this particular asteroid poses no threat, the piece notes that humanity's ability to defend against a potential impact is still developing, as shown by recent findings from the DART mission.</p>

          <p>A resident of Coconino County, Arizona, has died from pneumonic plague, a rare and severe lung infection caused by the Yersinia pestis bacterium. This is the first such death in the county since 2007, though officials state it is unrelated to a recent die-off of prairie dogs in the area that is also being investigated for plague. While pneumonic plague can be spread between people, officials say the risk is low, and they have issued guidelines for avoiding contact with wild rodents and their fleas.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address the significant safety disparity in vehicle crashes, where women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured than men. The legislation would require federal crash tests to use advanced dummies that better represent the female anatomy, as current tests predominantly use a dummy based on an average-sized male. Advocates believe this change is critical for designing safer cars for all drivers and reducing preventable injuries and fatalities.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is entering the summer recess in a state of political crisis, facing internal coalition turmoil and external pressure. A key vote to appoint new Constitutional Court judges failed due to dissent within his own party, raising questions about his leadership and control. In a recent interview, Merz also expressed sharp criticism of the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, while simultaneously bracing for the economic impact of new US tariffs on the EU, adding to a challenging start to his chancellorship.</p>

          <p>India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered airlines to inspect the fuel control switches on their Boeing aircraft. The mandate follows a preliminary report on a fatal Air India crash that suggested the fuel flow to the engines was cut off moments after takeoff. The checks are based on a 2018 US FAA advisory that was previously not mandatory. This move is part of a broader response to the disaster to ensure the continued airworthiness and safety of Boeing jets operating in the country.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew in June, with the decline in shipments to the United States being less severe than in the previous month. The data suggests that some U.S. importers rushed to place orders to build inventory ahead of a potential August deadline for the reimposition of high tariffs. Despite the ongoing trade war, China's global trade has continued to grow as it diversifies its markets, particularly with Southeast Asian nations. However, analysts expect export growth to slow in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. announcement to send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, this article explains their capabilities and strategic importance. The Patriot is a highly mobile, surface-to-air missile system designed to intercept aircraft, cruise missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles, covering a range of over 60 kilometers. While effective against many of the threats Russia uses, the system is expensive and requires about 90 troops to operate. This new supply, paid for by European allies, will significantly bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. These LFP batteries are significantly cheaper to produce than standard lithium-ion cells because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. This move is part of GM's strategy to diversify its EV portfolio and scale the production of more affordable electric vehicles, with commercial production of the new cells expected by late 2027.</p>
