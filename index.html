          <p>After an 11-week blockade, Israel allowed five UN aid lorries carrying humanitarian assistance, including baby food, into Gaza, following pressure from US Senators. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that this minimal food supply aims to prevent famine while Israel establishes aid distribution hubs protected by security contractors and the IDF. He also declared plans to expand the ground offensive against Hamas, ordering evacuations in Khan Younis. Despite criticism from right-wing politicians, Netanyahu emphasized the need to avert famine for both practical and diplomatic reasons, highlighting concerns voiced by US allies.

          <p>The United States Attorney for the District of California is launching "Operation Guardian Angel," a task force comprising ICE, HSI, DEA, FBI, ATF, and Border Patrol agents, to crack down on sanctuary policies in California. The task force will scan criminal databases daily to identify arrested illegal aliens who can be charged with felony illegal re-entry, aiming to circumvent local sanctuary policies. The attorney plans to file up to 50 warrants a week in his jurisdiction, which includes Los Angeles, and asserts that local authorities will comply with federal warrants. This program aims to make California a "testing ground" for other sanctuary jurisdictions, prioritizing the removal of illegal aliens with criminal charges and convictions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's injunction, allowing them to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants. This decision allows the administration to proceed with ending deportation protections and work permits for Venezuelans while legal proceedings continue. The program, established in 1990, offers temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing wars or natural disasters. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, and the case highlights the ongoing legal battles over immigration policies and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>Wendy McMahon, President of CBS News, resigned due to disagreements with the company's direction, amidst settlement negotiations with President Trump regarding his $20 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, nullifying the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to dismantle the agency. The judge deemed the administration's actions, including the removal of USIP's president and staff, a "gross usurpation of power" that violated the statute establishing USIP. The ruling details a forced takeover by DOGE officials, assisted by law enforcement, which the judge found exceeded constitutional authority. This decision underscores the importance of congressional oversight and the limitations on presidential power in restructuring government agencies.</p>
