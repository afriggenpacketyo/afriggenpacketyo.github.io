        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite weak jobs data and slowing GDP growth, the U.S. stock market has shown remarkable resilience, largely shrugging off recession fears. Analysts attribute this stability to strong corporate earnings from tech giants, the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and a prevailing investor belief that significant new tariffs will be avoided. While some experts caution about the potential for "stagflation," where the economy slows amid rising prices, the market's current focus remains on immediate opportunities rather than long-term risks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has successfully navigated pressure from the Trump administration to move iPhone production to the U.S. by announcing a plan to spend $600 billion in the country over four years. This strategy, which includes expanding partnerships with American suppliers like Corning and Texas Instruments, appears to have appeased the White House for now, securing an exemption for Apple from newly announced tariffs on chips. While final iPhone assembly will remain overseas, this move is seen as a symbolic victory that allows the president to claim credit for supporting U.S. jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research reveals a significant environmental paradox in China, where many major cities are experiencing more extreme rainfall while the country's overall river runoff has decreased over the past 60 years. A study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that over 72% of hydrological stations recorded a decline in water flow between 1956 and 2016, with the drop being particularly severe in the north. This trend poses a substantial threat to China's water security, which is essential for sustaining its large population, vast agricultural lands, and industrial output.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's overall approval rating remains in negative territory at 46%, though it has slightly improved. The poll also reveals a historically low favorability rating for the Democratic Party, which has sunk to a net -32 points. While Democrats hold a slight lead in congressional preference, the public shows disapproval of the president's handling of key issues like inflation and federal spending, with securing the southern border being the only issue with a positive rating.

This new blaze emerges as firefighters continue to battle the Gifford Fire in central California, now the state's largest of the year, highlighting the elevated wildfire risk across the region amid an intensifying heatwave.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been convicted of murdering fellow student Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The fatal stabbing, which occurred during a lunch break, followed a confrontation between the two teenagers earlier in the day that stemmed from a social media dispute. The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had admitted to manslaughter and possessing a knife but denied murder, claiming he had "snapped." Prosecutors argued the attack was premeditated, presenting evidence of the boy's interest in weapons.</p>

          <p>Youth sports in the U.S. have transformed from community-based activities into a high-stakes, expensive industry, placing immense pressure on families. The shift towards private, pay-to-play leagues, with average costs exceeding $1,000 per child, is driven by parental hopes of securing college scholarships and a competitive edge for their children. This professionalization leads to increased risks of burnout, anxiety, and injuries for young athletes while widening the class divide, excluding lower-income families from participation. Experts argue this trend reflects broader societal anxieties and is detrimental to children's well-being.</p>

          <p>New York City's primary utility, Con Edison, has disconnected power to over 88,000 households in the first half of 2025 while simultaneously seeking an 11% rate increase. This aggressive approach to cost recovery disproportionately affects low-income Black and Latino communities, who are already struggling with high energy costs and are more vulnerable to the dangers of extreme heat without power. Critics call the practice inhumane, as it leaves families without essential services and heightens health risks during heatwaves, turning energy affordability into a critical public health issue.</p>

This shift is attributed to the influence of the anti-vaccine movement and national conservatives who prioritize cultural battles over long-term scientific progress, creating a system that curtails innovation while also reducing healthcare access.</p>

The app allows women to anonymously review men and report "red flags," raising serious concerns about privacy, potential defamation lawsuits, and the reliability of crowdsourced information.

The moose, estimated to be about four years old, had exhibited unusual behavior by remaining near the Goodman Mountain trail.

          <p>A wage dispute at Birtat, a major German producer of döner kebab skewers, has been resolved, easing fears of a potential price increase for the country's most popular street food. Workers at the factory, who had been engaged in intermittent strikes, secured a deal that establishes a new minimum starting wage. The settlement is considered a historic first for the döner meat sector and has been welcomed by restaurant owners and consumers who were concerned that supply disruptions could drive up the cost of the beloved and budget-friendly meal.</p>

Organizations like the Caribbean Women's Health Association offer free doula services to advocate for and empower Black mothers, who are significantly more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women. By providing psychosocial care, creating birth plans, and acting as a liaison with medical staff, these doulas are working to ensure that Black women feel heard and supported throughout their pregnancy and postpartum journey.</p>

          <p>A new poll shows that a clear majority of German voters believe Chancellor Friedrich Merz should increase diplomatic pressure on Israel over its conduct in the Gaza conflict. This public sentiment aligns with the government's recent decision to partially halt military exports to Israel. The survey also indicates that only a minority of Germans now believe the country has a "special responsibility" for Israel's existence, a notable shift in public opinion. The poll reflects growing domestic concern over the humanitarian crisis and the fate of hostages held by Hamas. (not investment advice)</p>

The high-speed comet, traveling at 130,000 mph, was discovered last month and poses no threat to Earth. Hubble's observations have refined the size of the comet's icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across and revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around its nucleus.

          <p>This opinion article criticizes Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for artificial intelligence as being remarkably unambitious and bleak, despite massive financial investments in talent and research. The author argues that Zuckerberg's goal of creating a "personal superintelligence" seems primarily focused on improving ad targeting and increasing engagement on platforms like Instagram, rather than tackling world-changing problems. This commercial focus on what the article calls "sugar water" is contrasted with the more profound, and potentially dangerous, implications that most AI researchers believe superintelligence will have on society.</p>

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has officially approved a controversial plan to expand its military operations and take control of Gaza City, the most populous city in the enclave. The five-point plan aims to disarm Hamas, return all hostages, and establish Israeli security control before creating an alternative civilian administration. The decision has sparked fierce opposition both internationally and within Israel, including from military officials and hostage families who fear it will endanger the remaining captives and worsen the humanitarian catastrophe for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living there.</p>
