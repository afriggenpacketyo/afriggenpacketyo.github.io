          <p>A new study reports that elkhorn and staghorn corals are now "functionally extinct" in Florida following a record-breaking marine heatwave in 2023. These species are crucial for coastal protection against hurricanes and support vital fishing and tourism industries, valued in the billions of dollars annually. Their loss makes Florida's coastline significantly more vulnerable to storm damage and threatens the marine ecosystem, highlighting the severe, tangible impacts of climate change on both the environment and human life.</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has raised safety concerns about air traffic controllers working second jobs, like for Uber or DoorDash, to cope financially during the government shutdown. Duffy emphasized that these essential employees are already in high-stress roles and should not be distracted by financial pressures that force them into additional employment. The situation is contributing to significant flight delays and cancellations, as the department prioritizes safety by slowing down air traffic amid staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make "math error" notices sent to taxpayers easier to understand. These notices are issued for simple clerical mistakes on tax returns, but critics argue they are often unclear about the error and the 60-day response deadline. The legislation, now awaiting the president's signature, is intended to help taxpayers correct mistakes without needing professional assistance, thereby improving communication and reducing stress for filers.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House's East Wing is reportedly ahead of schedule to make way for a new, privately-funded 90,000-square-foot ballroom project initiated by President Trump. Preservation groups, like The National Trust for Historic Preservation, have expressed alarm, urging a pause until the plans undergo required public review, fearing the new structure will overwhelm the historic building. The White House has dismissed these criticisms and stated the project will include security enhancements and modernized offices, with major corporations listed as donors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live-fire artillery test over Interstate 5 and a major commuter rail line in Southern California without issuing specific public warnings, raising serious safety questions. State transportation officials were reportedly unaware that live rounds would be fired during the Friday evening commute, a day before a planned public demonstration for which the freeway was closed. The incident is now under scrutiny, especially after shrapnel from a prematurely exploding shell landed near a highway patrol vehicle during the Saturday event.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian is reportedly laying off more than 600 workers, which constitutes about 4% of its workforce, as it navigates a more difficult market. The company is facing challenges including slower-than-expected demand, the elimination of federal EV incentives, and significant financial losses, having lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter. The layoffs reflect broader pressures on EV makers as they adjust to shifting economic conditions and consumer demand ahead of new product launches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion amid high interest rates, this article explores several avenues for seeking debt relief. One primary method is working with a debt relief company to negotiate a settlement with creditors, which can significantly reduce the total amount owed but may impact credit scores. Other strategies include contacting card issuers directly for hardship programs, entering a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency, or using a debt consolidation loan to lower interest payments.

          <p>The UK government is expressing strong support for Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips to remain in her role, despite calls for her replacement from four members of the grooming gang inquiry's survivors panel. The controversy has deepened as another five survivors have written to the prime minister, stating they will only continue with the inquiry if Phillips keeps her job. This reveals a deep division within the panel, as the government now focuses on finding a new chair for the inquiry, a process expected to take months.</p>
