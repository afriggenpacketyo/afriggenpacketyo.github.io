        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal lies in her adherence to royal rules and traditions, unlike Princess Diana, who often challenged them. Kate married Prince William at a more mature age, allowing her to better understand the responsibilities and expectations of royal life. She maintains a composed demeanor, focusing on duty and avoiding personal drama, which has helped her navigate intense media scrutiny. In contrast, Princess Diana faced immense pressure and lacked the support system that Kate benefits from, leading to a more turbulent experience within the royal family. The article also notes the importance of Prince William's supportive role in helping Kate manage her royal duties with ease.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group, has declared its intention to lay down arms and disband after a 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state. This decision follows a call from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who suggested that the armed struggle had achieved its purpose and further progress could be made through political means. The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States, and others, has sought greater rights for Kurds within Turkey, moving away from its initial goal of an independent state. This move could significantly reshape Turkish politics and influence other Kurdish militias in the region, potentially leading to a new era of political dialogue and expanded Kurdish rights. The article highlights the potential benefits for President Erdogan, who could gain support among Kurds and claim success in ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a potential de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Both countries will suspend most of the levies imposed since early April for 90 days, allowing trade negotiations to progress.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to use executive powers to significantly reduce prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming to align them more closely with those in other countries. Trump stated that he would sign an order to cut prices by 30% to 80% and introduce a "most favored nation" policy, ensuring the U.S. pays the lowest price globally. This announcement led to a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks due to concerns about potential profit declines. The move follows previous attempts by Trump to address high drug costs, though some were challenged in court. The article notes that Trump did not specify whether the executive order would apply to Medicare, Medicaid, or other government health programs.</p>

          <p>Plans to build 164 apartments at a former factory site in Hunslet, Leeds, have been delayed due to the developer's inability to include affordable rentals. Councillors on Leeds City Council's planning panel deferred the decision after Countrylarge Ltd. stated that providing discount homes was not financially viable. Concerns were also raised about the reduction in green space contributions and the limited number of parking spaces included in the development. The project will be subject to a "late-stage review," requiring an affordable housing contribution if excess profits are made.</p>

          <p>Both China and the United States have indicated that progress was made in trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were "in-depth" and "candid". The White House called it a "trade deal" but gave no further details. The pair were engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China on its goods entering America in January. The huge tariffs caused turmoil in the financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation is expected to cause millions of poor Americans to lose Medicaid health coverage and millions more to pay higher fees when they go to the doctor. Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.</p>

          <h2>Spain's Power Outage Sparks Blame Game Over Green Energy</h2>

          <p>A catastrophic power outage affecting much of Spain, Portugal and the south of France has thrust the role of renewables and energy security into the spotlight. An abrupt and widespread blackout, one of Europe's worst in living memory, affected the entire Iberian Peninsula on April 28. The outage, which lasted for several hours, plunged much of the region into darkness, stranded thousands of train passengers and left millions without phone or internet coverage or access to cash from ATMs. Alongside Spanish opposition parties, some external observers have flagged renewables and net-zero emissions targets as possible reasons for the outage, particularly given Spain and Portugal both rely on high levels of wind and solar for their electricity grid.</p>

The 32-year-old founder has raised £1.5 million ($2 million) in venture capital to build Bloom Money.

          <p>Hamas has announced that it will release Edan Alexander, a U.S. citizen who was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. The release is said to be part of ongoing mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, reopen crossings into the Israeli-blockaded Palestinian territory and resume the delivery of aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it was aware of Hamas' plan to release Alexander, "as a gesture to the Americans," in a statement to CBS News on Sunday. President Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday that he was "grateful to all those involved in making this monumental news happen.</p>

          <p>Landmark China-US talks at the weekend likely carry economic and political significance on both sides while kick-starting a long process toward substantive deals that should address tariffs and other trade barriers, according to analysts. The apparent upbeat move in the Swiss city of Geneva stands to give both powers interim political relief at home without appearing weak on the trade war battlefront, they added. The article mentions that Chinese and US negotiators agreed during the talks – their first formal encounter since tariffs skyrocketed in early April as part of President Donald Trump’s trade war – to establish a “trade consultation mechanism” , Vice-Premier He Lifeng told reporters, while the White House released a statement describing the “China trade deal” and cited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comment of “substantial progress”.</p>

          <p>Top military officials from India and Pakistan are due to speak on Monday to discuss finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend. On Saturday, President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, saying "it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much". India announced on Monday that it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns. Both nations have ceased hostilities since then but say they remain vigilant, warning each other of the consequences of violating the ceasefire.</p>

"From 11:00 pm on May 11, the enemy attacked with 108 Shaheds and other types of drones," the air force said, adding that "as of 08:30 am, 55 drones were confirmed downed." The attack also included 30 stimulator drones which were lost along the way without hitting anything, the message on Telegram said. The attacks wounded one person and damaged residential buildings in the southern Odesa region, the military administration said.

          <p>Germany and Israel are commemorating the beginning of their postwar relationship, with the war in Gaza omnipresent. Sixty years ago, on May 12, 1965, Germany and Israel established diplomatic relations after a long period of preparation. It was anything but a matter of course at the time: World War II had ended just two decades earlier, and the memory of Nazi Germany's genocide of the European Jews was present in both countries. Even now, 80 years after the end of the war, relations with Israel remain extremely important, but also difficult.</p>

          <p>Reports that Donald Trump’s administration is preparing to accept a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have set off a storm of criticism, as ethics experts say such a gift would violate rules within the constitution that seek to guard against bribery and corruption. There is a long history of US presidents accepting gifts from foreign powers. The very desk from which Trump has signed a record number of executive order was given to the US by Queen Victoria in 1880. Under US law, foreign gifts valued at less than $480 can be retained by federal employees. Anything over that amount is considered a gift to the “people of the United States” and must be logged and then disposed of by the White House Gift Unit.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday challenged Russia's President Vladimir Putin to meet him personally in Turkey on Thursday, the latest move in a weekend-long exchange of proposals from both sides on the next steps in the U.S.-led peace effort. Zelenskyy said that he still hopes for a ceasefire with Russia starting Monday, and that he will "be waiting for Putin" in Turkey "personally" after U.S. President Donald Trump insisted Ukraine accept Russia's latest offer — to hold direct talks in Turkey on Thursday. Ukraine, along with European allies, had demanded Russia accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting Monday before holding talks, but Moscow effectively rejected the proposal and called for direct negotiations instead.</p>
