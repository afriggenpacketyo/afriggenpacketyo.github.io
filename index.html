          <p>A couple from Arkansas, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were found deceased in a suspected homicide at Devil's Den State Park.

Authorities have released a description of a male suspect seen leaving the park in a black sedan and are asking the public for any photos or videos from the area. The investigation is ongoing, with state and federal agencies collaborating to determine a motive and apprehend the suspect responsible for the tragic event.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a request from an investment fund, Azoria Capital, to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings to be open to the public. The judge ruled that the FOMC is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a Donald Trump ally, was primarily a publicity stunt for the new fund. The decision upholds the long-standing practice of the Federal Reserve conducting its interest rate deliberations in private. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders, the head football coach for the University of Colorado, has revealed he is now "cured from cancer" after undergoing surgery to remove his bladder in May. The procedure was necessitated by the discovery of a high-grade tumor, and Sanders confirmed he will continue coaching in the upcoming season, dispelling rumors of his resignation. The two-time Super Bowl winner spoke about the life-altering nature of the surgery and urged African-American men in particular to get regular health check-ups. His doctors confirmed the successful outcome at a press conference.</p>

          <p>Model and television personality Heidi Klum has responded to public criticism regarding a lingerie campaign she appeared in alongside her 21-year-old daughter, Leni. Klum stated she is proud of her daughter and that they are both comfortable with the advertisements for the Italian brand Intimissimi. She attributed their ease to her European background and having always been open about her body with her children. Leni, who began her modeling career at 16, has also previously addressed the backlash, stating she focuses on the positive reactions rather than the negative commentary.</p>

          <p>Leaders from France and Germany have voiced strong criticism of the new trade deal negotiated between the European Union and the United States. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned the agreement would cause "substantial damage," while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as an act of "submission." The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. in exchange for increased American energy purchases by Europe. While many EU members expressed relief that a full-scale trade war was averted, the overall reaction across the bloc has been notably downbeat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is projected to significantly raise tariffs on EU goods, potentially reducing the bloc's GDP. The deal establishes a 15% U.S. tariff on most imports from the EU, which previously faced an average rate of about 1.2%. In return, the EU has committed to substantial purchases of U.S. energy and increased investment. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturing, some economists view it as unbalanced, though they concede it averts the more severe 30% tariff threat.

          <p>Two prominent Israeli human rights organizations, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have accused the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. In a joint report, the groups allege that Israel's actions constitute a "coordinated, deliberate action to destroy Palestinian society" through mass killings and the creation of catastrophic living conditions. The report specifically highlights the systematic destruction of Gaza's healthcare infrastructure. An Israeli government spokesperson has dismissed the allegations from the NGOs as "baseless," maintaining its long-held denial of such claims.</p>

          <p>Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, Jesse Clark Garcia and Diego Bonillo, have pleaded guilty to federal charges for accepting bribes to allow drug-filled vehicles to cross the border from Mexico. Prosecutors stated the officers used a secret emoji-based code to communicate with traffickers and identify which inspection lanes to use. The officers then waved the vehicles through without inspection. As part of his plea, one officer admitted to allowing at least 165 pounds of fentanyl into the country, with both facing a potential maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

He later posted another apology on social media, attributing the gaffe to being "too effusive" while making a point about the economy, an incident that quickly drew widespread attention online.</p>

          <p>A tariff simulator from Datawheel forecasts that Chinese exports to the U.S. could plummet by as much as $485 billion by 2027 due to the ongoing trade war. The model, which predicts shifts in global trade based on current tariff rates, suggests this decline will be driven by the U.S. reconfiguring its trade relationships. While U.S. imports from China are expected to fall sharply, the simulator projects increased imports from partners like Canada and Mexico. Conversely, China is expected to reduce its imports of U.S. goods and expand trade with other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Historically, lower interest rates boost gold's appeal, but recent price surges have also been driven by persistent inflation and geopolitical concerns.

          <p>Despite high U.S. tariffs on imported goods, some of Wall Street's most severe recession fears are beginning to subside. The recent U.S.-E.U. trade deal suggests that the effective tariff rate will likely settle in the 15-20% range, lower than the 25% or more that was initially feared. Economists now point to a strong global growth backdrop and a less severe inflationary impact than expected as reasons for cautious optimism.
