          <h2>Israel Initiates Daily Tactical Pauses in Gaza to Facilitate Humanitarian Aid Delivery</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 13:05:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's military has started a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in specific areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to distribute supplies amid a worsening hunger crisis. This action follows intense international pressure and warnings of famine, with images of malnourished children increasing global criticism of Israel's operations. While the UN and allies like France welcome the step, they stress that a full ceasefire is essential to effectively address the humanitarian catastrophe, as fighting continues in other parts of the territory. The announcement coincides with aid trucks from Egypt and Jordan beginning to enter, though Hamas has dismissed the pause as a public relations effort rather than a genuine attempt to save lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are jointly calling for subpoenas against Jeffrey Epstein's estate and have introduced legislation to compel the release of all government files on the case. Their proposed bill would have the force of law, ensuring a comprehensive disclosure of documents while protecting victims' identities. Massie emphasized the need to examine financial records and the original plea deal, stating there is much more to uncover than just specific letters. The push for transparency comes as they seek a discharge petition to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson, who they criticize for adjourning the House early to avoid a vote on the matter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia to negotiate an end to a border conflict that has resulted in at least 34 deaths and displaced over 168,000 people. The talks were organized following diplomatic pressure from the United States, with President Trump urging both nations to agree to a ceasefire. Despite the planned negotiations, fighting continued over the weekend, with both sides accusing each other of initiating new attacks involving heavy artillery and troop movements. The long-disputed 500-mile border has seen tensions flare periodically, but the current clashes represent a significant and deadly escalation.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University President Ted Carter stated he is not feeling significant pressure from the Trump administration's investigation into alleged antisemitic practices and diversity policies on campus. He expressed confidence that the university's actions have been appropriate and noted that research funding remains strong, despite some minor impacts. Carter acknowledged the decline in public confidence in higher education, citing concerns over cost, return on investment, and perceived liberal bias. He highlighted OSU's efforts to improve affordability, with 57% of recent undergraduates graduating debt-free, and affirmed a commitment to hiring faculty across the political spectrum to counter these negative perceptions.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamic State affiliate, has resulted in the deaths of dozens of people in Komanda, a town in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Local officials reported that approximately 20 of the victims were worshippers attending a night vigil at a church when the militants struck, subsequently looting and burning nearby businesses. The ADF, which originated in Uganda but is now based in DR Congo, frequently targets civilians. This incident highlights the persistent violence in the mineral-rich Ituri province, where various armed groups operate despite the presence of Ugandan troops invited to help quell the insurgency.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the United States and China are likely to agree to another 90-day extension of their tariff truce during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The current suspension of tariffs, which began in May, is set to expire on August 12. While the extension is anticipated, insiders do not expect major breakthroughs on specific issues like China's industrial overcapacity. Instead, the talks will focus on maintaining the current de-escalation, with both sides committing not to impose new tariffs or escalate the trade war. The Chinese delegation is also expected to press the US on its tariffs related to fentanyl production.</p>

          <p>A protest on the Greek island of Syros against an Israeli cruise ship has sparked a heated national debate about the conflict in Gaza and antisemitism. Around 300 demonstrators with Palestinian flags prevented the MS Crown Iris from docking, leading the cruise line to cancel the stop. The incident has divided public opinion, with some condemning the protest as racist and harmful to tourism, while others support it as a stand against the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The debate reflects a broader political polarization in Greece, where support for Israel or Palestine often aligns with party affiliation, highlighting the complex intersection of foreign policy, domestic politics, and public sentiment.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old woman has suffered potentially life-changing head injuries in an incident on a ride at the Netley Marsh Steam and Craft Show in Hampshire, UK. The teenager was hospitalized following the event, which occurred late Saturday night. Police are now investigating the incident in collaboration with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to determine the cause. A witness who provided first aid described a scene of "shock and panic," expressing deep concern that such a serious incident could happen on a fairground ride. Despite the event, the fair organizers announced they would remain open for the final day of the show.</p>

          <p>New mothers across the US are facing traumatic child welfare investigations due to false positive drug tests triggered by common foods like poppy seeds or even hospital-administered medications. The article highlights cases where mothers who tested positive for opiates were forced into restrictive "safety plans," separating them from their newborns, only for later, more accurate tests to clear them. This practice stems from laws in many states requiring hospitals to report positive tests to child welfare authorities, often before a confirmatory test can rule out a false positive. Critics and medical groups argue that these policies are unjust, turning a simple drug screen into a parenting test and causing immense, unnecessary distress for families.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the urgent humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump in Scotland. Starmer is expected to support US efforts for a ceasefire and explore further actions to get one in place, especially after recent talks in Qatar stalled. The meeting comes as Israel faces mounting international pressure over the starvation crisis in Gaza, with aid agencies decrying airdrops as insufficient. The UK government has described the situation as "utterly horrifying," emphasizing that starvation must not be used as a weapon of war and calling for unhindered aid access.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old boy in foster care has died in Alabama after being left in a hot car by a contract worker for the state's Department of Human Resources. The child, Ke’Torrius Starkes Jr., was reportedly forgotten in the vehicle after a supervised visit with his father. He was supposed to be transported to a daycare program but was found unresponsive in the vehicle hours later and pronounced dead at the scene. The incident occurred on a hot day in a car with tinted windows, and the coroner has indicated no other competing cause of death. A police investigation is now underway to determine if criminal charges are warranted.</p>

          <p>A new individual retirement account (IRA) established for children under the Trump administration is being analyzed for its practical benefits. The plan allows parents and employers to make tax-advantaged contributions up to $5,000 annually for children under 18, with a one-time $1,000 government contribution for those born between 2025 and 2028. While the free initial deposit is an attractive offer, this article suggests that other savings vehicles like 529 education plans or whole life insurance policies may offer more substantial long-term benefits. The analysis concludes that while the Trump IRA is a nice gesture, it functions more as a minor political giveaway than a transformative savings tool for families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia reported that a Ukrainian drone attack targeted St. Petersburg, forcing the city's airport to close for five hours on the country's Navy Day. The attack occurred as President Vladimir Putin was in the city for the holiday, though the traditional large-scale naval parade had been canceled due to security concerns. The Russian Defence Ministry claimed to have downed 291 drones across the country, with over ten intercepted near St. Petersburg, where falling debris injured one woman. The incident highlights Ukraine's growing capability to strike deep within Russian territory, disrupting significant national events and civilian life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown a significant boost in employee happiness, and the reason extends beyond simply having more free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a major factor is that the compressed schedule forces workers and teams to become more effective and productive. By cutting out busywork and streamlining processes to fit their tasks into less time, employees report feeling more on top of their work and more competent in their roles. This enhanced sense of professional achievement and control contributes significantly to their overall well-being, demonstrating a powerful psychological benefit of the shortened workweek.</p>

The performance at the Co-op Live arena has been rescheduled for August 5, and all tickets will remain valid for the new date. The last-minute cancellation has drawn frustration from many fans, some of whom described the short notice as a "joke" and the reason as a "lame excuse." The concert was part of Drake's global tour, his first in Europe in six years, and he had already performed two successful shows in the city over the weekend.</p>
