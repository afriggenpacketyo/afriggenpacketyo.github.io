          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 01:21:39 EDT</div>

          <p>Ferrari's stock recorded its worst trading day ever after the luxury carmaker released updated full-year and 2030 guidance that fell short of analyst expectations. The company also scaled back its electrification targets, now aiming for a 2030 lineup of 40% internal combustion, 40% hybrid, and 20% fully electric vehicles, a reduction from its previous 40% EV goal. This pivot is attributed to a client-centric approach and evolving market conditions, even as Ferrari prepares to launch its first electric vehicle in late 2026. The announcement reflects broader industry trends where carmakers are reassessing ambitious EV targets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings forecasts a sharper decline in China's real estate market for 2025, projecting an 8% drop in new home sales to 8.8-9 trillion yuan, a more pessimistic outlook than previously anticipated. This extended slump, now entering its fifth year, is primarily due to fragile homebuyer sentiment despite government efforts to stabilize the sector. Beijing's policy easing has been less aggressive than in prior years, with limited interest rate reductions and targeted purchase restriction relaxations. The article highlights that a sustainable recovery hinges on restoring consumer confidence, particularly in higher-tier cities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to begin an impeachment trial against President Dina Boluarte, driven by widespread anger over her government's perceived failure to curb rising crime rates. The decision followed a shooting at a concert that injured five people, intensifying public and legislative pressure. Boluarte has partially blamed illegal immigration for the crime surge, a stance that has drawn criticism. This marks the ninth impeachment attempt against her, with broad cross-party support for the motions, indicating significant political instability in the nation. The President is expected to defend herself before Congress. </p>

          <p>England football legend Wayne Rooney has defended his generation of players, asserting that their lack of international success was not due to a poor attitude, contrary to Steven Gerrard's recent comments. Gerrard had described the team as "egotistical losers" who lacked cohesion. Rooney, speaking on his BBC podcast, acknowledged they didn't win anything but insisted they worked hard and tried their best. He suggested that current England squads benefit from better media relations and a different generation of players training together. Rooney maintained that despite the rivalries, everyone on his team was committed to each other. </p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, will announce at their annual conference that his party is prepared to replace Welsh Labour in the upcoming Senedd election. Labour has governed Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polls suggest Plaid Cymru is now vying for leadership, alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, offering "new energy and new ideas" and presenting themselves as the leading anti-Reform party. While independence is a long-term goal, the party's immediate focus for the 2026 vote will be on delivering radical yet financially prudent policies, such as a child poverty payment. </p>

This move follows TechInsights' report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, consistent with findings from other research firms. Such reliance on foreign technology raises questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls and Huawei's self-sufficiency efforts amid U.S. trade blacklisting.

This innovative method opens new possibilities for harnessing clean power in cold environments. The research team observed that when salt-doped ice was bent, it produced an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, the generation of an electrical charge when a material undergoes non-uniform strain. The discovery could lead to the development of low-cost energy sources in frigid regions. </p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has threatened to fire air traffic controllers who are calling in sick during the government shutdown, labeling them "problem children." He claimed these absent employees are responsible for over half of the country's flight delays, while praising the 90% who continue to work without pay. Duffy reiterated that only those who come to work would be paid once the government reopens, contradicting President Trump's earlier suggestion that some federal workers might not receive retroactive pay. The ongoing shutdown has severely impacted air travel and is now affecting military personnel and public institutions like the Smithsonian. </p>

          <p>Mark Bray, a Rutgers University professor and anti-fascism expert, was blocked from leaving the US for Spain when his and his family's flight reservations mysteriously disappeared at the gate. This incident occurred hours after President Trump hosted a White House roundtable highlighting 'antifa' activists, and after Bray received death threats and had his home address revealed online. Bray, who has been dubbed "Dr. Antifa" by some students, clarified he is a professor researching anti-fascism, not a member of any group. He and his family are relocating to Europe due to safety concerns, with the professor believing the flight cancellation was not a coincidence. </p>

Nvidia also saw gains, with CEO Jensen Huang confirming increased demand and the company's investment in Elon Musk's xAI startup.

          <p>Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger engaged in a heated debate for Virginia's gubernatorial race, clashing over the federal government shutdown and political violence. Earle-Sears, trailing in polls, aggressively questioned Spanberger, who largely maintained a bipartisan tone while criticizing her opponent. The debate highlighted the impact of Washington politics on Virginia, a state with many federal employees affected by the shutdown. A scandal involving a Democratic attorney general candidate's violent remarks also dominated the discussion, with Earle-Sears pressing Spanberger on her endorsement. Cultural issues, particularly transgender children in sports and bathrooms, also featured prominently. </p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills is anticipated to launch her Senate campaign next Tuesday, aiming to unseat long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, a Democrat, has gained national attention for her vocal opposition to President Trump's policies, including a public argument over transgender girls in sports. As a top recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, she will join a growing primary field, including progressive oyster farmer Graham Platner. The Maine Senate race is seen as a crucial opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and challenge the Republican majority in the Senate, given the state's Democratic leanings. </p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party leadership race signifies the potential rise of the country's first female prime minister and a notable shift in its ideological direction. Known for her staunch conservative and nationalist views, Takaichi's ascent could end the centrist pragmatism of previous administrations. Domestically, she aims to revive Abenomics with a nationalist twist, focusing on state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology to reduce reliance on China. Her approach could deepen "friendshoring" with Southeast Asian economies but may also tie aid and investment more closely to strategic cooperation. </p>

          <p>Battlefield 6, the latest installment in the military shooter series, is poised to challenge Call of Duty with significant investment and a renewed focus on player feedback. Developed by four EA-owned studios, the game aims to overcome the negative reception of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. A preview weekend garnered "explosively positive" feedback, and the new game restores a single-player campaign, a feature missing from the previous title. Despite the project's scale and the reported hundreds of millions spent, developers express excitement about its potential. The team is committed to monthly updates and content additions to maintain momentum post-launch. </p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at bolstering California's FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort, which incurred significant losses from January's wildfires. The legislation seeks to ease the plan's financial burdens and increase legislative oversight. Assembly Bill 226 will enable the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank to issue bonds for catastrophic claims and allow the plan to secure lines of credit. Other bills enhance transparency, require comparable insurance for manufactured homes, and mandate an automatic payment plan for customers. These reforms address long-standing issues and the increasing challenges posed by climate-fueled firestorms. </p>

          <p>UK universities have collectively announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with additional cost savings equivalent to 3,000 more jobs, according to analysis by the University and College Union (UCU). This comes as four in ten English universities face financial deficits, prompting UCU members to consider strike action over a 1.4% pay offer. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association acknowledges the "difficult decisions" but stresses they are the "only prudent option." Staff report feeling demoralized, exhausted, and furious, with impacts extending to students through reduced support services and module choices. </p>
