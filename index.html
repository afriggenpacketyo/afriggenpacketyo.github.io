          <p>Maryland officials conducted a profound reinterment ceremony for 65 of the state's earliest Catholic settlers at Historic St. Mary's City, more than three centuries after their original burials. The event, held at the newly reconstructed 17th-century Brick Chapel, honored these individuals who were foundational in pioneering religious liberty in colonial America. Researchers extensively studied the remains, uncovering valuable insights into chronic illnesses, diet, and dental care from that era, with findings to be published in a future book. This observance also delivered a broader message about tolerance and coexistence, advocating for St. Mary's City's recognition as a pivotal site in American history, comparable to Jamestown and Plymouth for its role in establishing fundamental American experiences.</p>

          <p>US envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff are traveling to Egypt to finalize technical details for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, following former President Trump's assertion that a deal is "very close." Hamas has indicated its acceptance of key aspects of Trump's 20-point peace proposal, including an end to the conflict and Israeli withdrawal, alongside the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Despite these diplomatic efforts, Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties, which Hamas cited as evidence against Israeli claims of reduced military operations. Egypt is set to host further delegations, though critical issues like Hamas's potential disarmament remain points of contention, underscoring the delicate nature of ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>Detective Devin Rigo of the Hillsboro Police Department faced a critical setback in the murder investigation of Kenneth Fandrich when a crucial minivan, believed to be the primary crime scene, was inadvertently destroyed at a scrapyard. Investigators determined Fandrich was likely killed inside the vehicle by a masked assailant, later identified as Dr. Steven Milner, a former veterinarian with a history of stalking the victim. Milner had attempted to conceal the crime by spray-painting security cameras. Despite identifying the minivan's VIN and locating it, detectives arrived too late, watching helplessly as the key piece of evidence was crushed, significantly impacting the forensic aspect of the case against Milner.</p>

          <p>China's gold market is currently experiencing a significant surge, with prices nearing an unprecedented US$3,900 an ounce, which has created a mix of excitement and trepidation among investors and consumers. Many individuals are grappling with the dilemma of whether to buy, sell, or hold their gold assets, often expressing frustration over missed opportunities as prices continue to climb. For example, one Guangzhou engineer sold 200 grams anticipating a downward correction, only to witness prices rise further, prompting a shift to investing in silver. This article highlights how the record-high rally has generated a "gold fever" environment, where sentiment remains highly volatile in both individual and retail sectors.</p>

This incident is part of a broader pattern across Europe, with mysterious drone and balloon sightings also causing closures at Lithuania's main airport and over military bases in Belgium and Denmark. European interior ministers are scheduled to discuss a comprehensive "drone detection and defense plan" this weekend, as concerns grow about potential state or non-state actors behind these disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is significantly lagging behind other major markets like China and Europe in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, despite recent sales increases driven by a now-expired government subsidy. Analysts predict a sharp drop in EV demand following the end of the $7,500 tax credit, as high interest rates and inflation already deter buyers. This article highlights how policy differences, with former President Biden pushing for EV growth and former President Trump advocating market-driven sales and implementing tariffs, have impacted the sector. High prices for EVs in the US, partly due to tariffs on Chinese manufacturers, further contribute to the slower transition compared to global trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for the deployment fell short of the high bar required without the state governor's consent, stating that protests were "not significantly violent or disruptive." The judge emphasized the constitutional tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs, affirming that the nation operates under constitutional law, not martial law. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek, lauded the decision as a victory for state sovereignty and a clear message against presidential overreach, maintaining that local law enforcement can manage the situation.</p>

U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach reposted an X post showcasing the proposed coin, which includes Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him pumping his fist with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight" on the reverse. This consideration is made possible by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. However, existing legal provisions, including the Thayer Amendment, typically prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, raising potential challenges unless Congress provides a specific exception, as it has done in the past for commemorative issues.</p>

Scientists confirm this accelerated melt is unequivocally linked to human-induced global warming from fossil fuel emissions, noting that even if temperatures stabilized, a substantial amount of future melt is already "locked in."

The People's Assembly will not be directly elected; rather, "electoral colleges" are tasked with selecting representatives for two-thirds of the 210 seats, while Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint the remaining third. Elections were postponed in three key provinces—Raqqa, Hassakeh, and Suweida—due to ongoing security and political instability. This article highlights strong criticism from civil society groups, who argue that the president's direct and indirect influence over the electoral committees and college selections renders the elections largely symbolic, failing to genuinely represent the popular will, particularly given the millions of displaced Syrians.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people defiantly participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, protesting Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government and its increasing restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights. Despite a police ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court, an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 demonstrators, including several Members of the European Parliament, gathered with rainbow and EU flags. Orban's ruling ultra-conservative Fidesz party passed a law allowing Pride marches to be banned, claiming the move was needed to "protect children," which Amnesty International has criticized as "repressive legislation." This article highlights the ongoing struggle for fundamental human rights in Hungary and the determination of its LGBTQ+ community and allies to resist governmental overreach and advocate for their freedoms.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA Bruins achieved a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, largely credited to the innovative playcalling of newly elevated tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel. Elevated just four days prior, Neuheisel devised an offensive plan that saw the Bruins score on each of their first five drives, securing their first win against a top-10 team since 2007. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivered a career-best performance, accounting for five touchdowns—three rushing and two passing—and showcasing remarkable leadership. This article highlights the team's dramatic turnaround and renewed belief under Neuheisel, transforming a nationally lampooned season into a moment of triumph and potentially a significant turning point for the program.</p>

          <p>"Freshers' flu," a pervasive illness among new university students, is primarily an assortment of common cold viruses that spread rapidly due to the close living conditions and intense social interactions characteristic of early term. Immunologists explain that students, arriving from diverse locations, are exposed to a cocktail of new respiratory viruses, while factors such as high stress, poor diet, insufficient sleep, and alcohol consumption significantly compromise their immune systems. The article highlights that the immense pressure to socialize and make friends often overrides the need for adequate rest, rendering students highly susceptible and prone to transmitting viruses even before noticeable symptoms emerge. Experts recommend prioritizing rest and seeking medical assistance for any persistent or worsening symptoms.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is "on the verge of a very great achievement" in Gaza, expressing hope to announce the return of all hostages "in the coming days" while asserting the IDF's continued deep presence in the Strip. Former President Trump affirmed Israel's agreement to an initial withdrawal line, stating that a ceasefire would become "IMMEDIATELY effective" upon Hamas's confirmation, initiating the hostage and prisoner exchange. Trump also issued a stern warning to Hamas, urging swift action on hostage release "or else all bets will be off," and emphasizing that he would not tolerate delays. This article highlights the high-stakes diplomatic efforts and military posturing surrounding the potential Gaza peace deal, with indirect talks between Israeli and Hamas officials set to resume in Egypt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children into adult detention centers upon turning 18, preventing planned transfers this weekend. U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that automatically detaining these individuals violates an earlier 2021 court order which explicitly required their release to the "least restrictive setting available," provided they are not a danger or flight risk. This article highlights a growing list of legal clashes over the Trump administration's controversial immigration policies, including accusations of reviving family separations and a reported plan to offer immigrant children $2,500 to self-deport, underscoring ongoing concerns about the treatment of unaccompanied minors and their legal rights.</p>

          <p>The United States' increasing disengagement from the United Nations and the broader multilateral system it was instrumental in building may inadvertently create a "tremendous opportunity" for other influential nations, notably China. Despite a collective global will to navigate towards the "right path," the UN organization itself is perceived as adrift, a sentiment echoed 23 years after former Secretary-General Kofi Annan highlighted its "fork in the road." This article underscores how the US, historically the UN's primary architect, largest single financial contributor, and host nation, has progressively turned its back on this international framework. This retreat could potentially allow countries like China to expand their influence and leadership roles on the global stage, reshaping international dynamics.</p>

          <p>An explosion and hours-long fire at Chevron's El Segundo refinery deeply unnerved surrounding communities, drawing attention to the facility's extensive history of safety and environmental violations. The incident has raised significant concerns about the federal government shutdown, as critical investigative agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board are largely furloughed, potentially hindering a comprehensive investigation into the root causes. This article details the refinery's numerous past citations for chemical leaks, equipment failures, and inadequate hazard analyses. It underscores labor unions' fears for worker safety and environmental advocates' calls for a transition away from fossil fuels, given the inherent dangers of these industrial operations and the compromised oversight during governmental shutdowns.</p>
