          <p>A severe storm, potentially a tornado, swept through St. Louis, resulting in at least five fatalities and numerous injuries, according to Mayor Cara Spencer. The storm caused significant damage to over 5,000 homes, tearing off roofs, damaging siding, and downing trees and power lines. A curfew was implemented to facilitate search and rescue efforts, with officials urging residents to stay home and conserve cell service for emergencies. The National Weather Service indicated a tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, while severe weather also impacted other states, including Kentucky and Texas, with threats of hail, high winds, and extreme heat.</p>

Three employees have been placed on administrative leave as the sheriff's office investigates the breach, citing defective locks and insufficient staffing as contributing factors.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and disrupting travel and outdoor activities. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the city, as winds of 60 to 70 mph carried dust from dry farmlands into the area. The storm forced drivers to pull over on interstates, halted flights at Midway International Airport, and interrupted a high school graduation ceremony. The skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, but the event was described as "something out of the history books."</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing concern among those who rely on the program. An analysis estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts aim to eliminate fraud and waste without affecting coverage, many Medicaid recipients fear reduced access to healthcare or having to choose between coverage and basic necessities. Stories from individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, and Jodie Montplaisir, a recovering opioid user, highlight the potential impact of these cuts on vulnerable populations.</p>

These two plants account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity.

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies that may face delisting from US stock exchanges. Amid rising US-China tensions and regulatory pressures, there is growing concern that Chinese firms trading in the US could be forced to seek alternative listing venues. Deloitte China CEO Patrick Tsang has submitted proposals to the Hong Kong government outlining strategies to bolster the city's financial preparedness, including simplifying listing procedures and securing funding for these companies. This move could significantly benefit Hong Kong's financial markets and strengthen its position as a global financial hub.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team at the National University of Defence Technology has developed the Tianxing-1, a small rocket featuring wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. The Tianxing-1 operates on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower pace, making it potentially less effective against high-speed aircraft or drones. This development represents an effort to modernize and enhance the capabilities of China's existing military technology.</p>

          <p>Audio recordings have surfaced from a 2023 interview between former President Joe Biden and a Justice Department investigator, revealing instances of memory lapses. The recordings, obtained by Axios, capture Biden struggling to recall key milestones from his own life, including the year he left office as vice-president and the date of his son Beau's death. This release comes after Special Counsel Robert Hur described Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory" in a report that provoked criticism from the White House. The emergence of this audio has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities and his fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', citing concerns over the government's ability to repay its debt. The downgrade reflects the increase in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels significantly higher than similarly rated countries.

A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt and generally face higher borrowing costs, however, Moody's maintained that the US "retains exceptional credit strengths."</p>
