            <p>A CIA official, Hurley Blankenship, reported that no substantive messages could be recovered from former CIA Director John Ratcliffe's Signal account during a review aimed at preserving communications. Only residual administrative content, such as chat names and setting changes, was found. This revelation followed concerns raised by American Oversight regarding potential auto-deletion of messages, despite federal requirements for communication preservation. Conversely, officials successfully preserved messages from the devices of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, highlighting inconsistencies in the preservation of official communications across different departments.</p>

            <p>Cody Balmer was arrested and charged with attempted murder, terrorism, arson, and other counts after allegedly setting fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence. Balmer admitted to police that he harbored hatred towards Governor Josh Shapiro and intentionally started the fire while the governor and his family were inside. Security footage showed Balmer breaking into the residence and throwing Molotov cocktails. The fire caused millions of dollars in damage, and Balmer's actions were condemned as domestic terrorism by the Harrisburg Fire Chief. President Trump also commented on the incident, calling Balmer a "whack job."</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has begun investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, potentially leading to tariffs based on national security concerns. The inquiries, initiated under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, will assess the impact of these imports on US national security, with a public comment period of 21 days. These investigations could result in tariffs similar to those previously imposed on steel, aluminum, and the auto industry. The US relies heavily on imported chips from Taiwan, and the administration aims to increase domestic manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is refusing to comply with demands from the Trump administration, potentially forfeiting billions in federal funding. The demands included ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, adopting merit-based admissions, and cooperating with immigration authorities. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the school will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. Faculty members have filed a lawsuit to block the funding cuts, arguing they undermine free speech and academic inquiry. The administration has taken similar actions against other universities.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration faces scrutiny for its response to a Supreme Court order regarding a wrongful deportation. The administration argues it is complying with the order by removing domestic hurdles, but critics contend this falls short of meaningfully changing the situation. Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadorian prison despite the Supreme Court's directive to "facilitate" his release. The case highlights the judiciary's challenge in checking Trump's power if its rulings lack the force to alter the administration's behavior.</p>

            <p>A vaccine expert expresses concern that child measles deaths are being 'normalized' amidst a recent outbreak. The U.S. has seen over 700 measles cases and 3 deaths this year, despite the availability of a highly effective vaccine. The federal response is under scrutiny due to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s history of spreading misinformation about vaccines. The expert suggests the department isn't doing enough to combat the outbreak. The rise in cases is attributed to decreased vaccination rates.</p>

            <p>Each spring, China's policymakers and state media customarily toss around an idiom to bid the economy an auspicious start: kai men hong – literally, “open door red”. But in tough economic times, when prosperity takes a back seat to lethargy, by the time summer rolls around and temperatures rise, momentum has a tendency to fizzle. Some years, enthusiasm downright nosedives after a kai men hong start. For this year, China is set to release its first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth on Wednesday.</p>
