          <p>President Trump has rejected the notion that he is backing down on tariff threats, dismissing the "TACO trade" label coined by a Financial Times columnist. Trump asserted that his tariff announcements are a negotiation tactic that has led to progress in trade discussions with other countries. He defended his approach, stating that it has prompted the European Union to engage in meetings and negotiations. Trump criticized the questioning of his strategy as "nasty," emphasizing that his actions are aimed at gaining ground for the U.S. in trade agreements.</p>

Participants acknowledged increased uncertainty in the economic outlook, emphasizing the need for caution until the effects of government policies become clearer. The Fed officials also discussed the five-year policy framework, noting the desire for policy that is "robust to a wide variety of economic environments," and that they have no intention on altering the inflation goal.

Trump has accused Harvard of enrolling too many foreign students from "radicalized" areas, suggesting a cap of 15% and demanding assurance of their loyalty to the U.S. These actions follow Homeland Security's previous demands for data on international students and the subsequent revocation of Harvard's SEVP certification, which was later blocked by a judge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik, President Trump's recent executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030. Trump's orders direct the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite decisions on applications for new nuclear plants, potentially leading to construction approvals for SMRs by 2027. GE Vernova recently secured approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, marking the first SMR deployment in the West, and the Tennessee Valley Authority has applied to build a GE Vernova reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Strazik notes high customer interest in SMRs due to their carbon-free emissions, with users increasingly willing to pay a premium for nuclear energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor is aiming for substantial growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), twenty-five years after introducing hybrid vehicles to the American market with the Prius. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030, though this target may change based on regulations and customer acceptance. This expansion comes amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, in which the company also continues to invest significantly. Toyota's planned PHEV expansion aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles in the state by 2035, though President Trump is expected to eliminate that rule.</p>

The Justice Department's new pardon attorney will also review the case, which resulted in two convictions, two guilty pleas, and two acquittals.

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly pushing for military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. This has caused tension between Trump and Netanyahu, with the latter believing military action is necessary due to Iran's vulnerability. Trump, however, prefers negotiation backed by the threat of military action if talks fail, fearing Netanyahu will allow Iran to keep its uranium enrichment facilities. Israeli officials have met with U.S. officials to discuss these differing views, with Trump acknowledging he warned Netanyahu against attacking while negotiations are underway.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering demanding "golden shares" in Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, which would grant the U.S. government veto power over certain corporate functions and board appointments. This move raises questions about the future of foreign investment in the U.S., potentially setting a precedent for government intervention in strategic sectors like manufacturing, technology, or defense. Experts suggest this model could be applied to other deals, such as TikTok, but caution against potential retaliation from other countries imposing similar restrictions on American companies. The administration is also facing criticism over its approach to Big Oil, crypto crime, and legal challenges to executive orders.</p>

          <p>JoÃ«l Le Scouarnec, a former French surgeon, has been sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison for sexually abusing 299 people, mostly children, in what is considered the largest pedophilia case in French history. The trial revealed failures in the legal and health administrative systems, as he was allowed to continue treating children unsupervised despite a 2005 conviction for downloading child abuse imagery. The trial occurred amid a growing reckoning in France over sexual abuse, with some victims feeling the case was overshadowed. Many victims expressed disappointment with the sentence, feeling it did not adequately reflect the scale of his crimes.</p>

          <p>Japan, grappling with government debt twice the size of its economy, faces increasing pressure to curtail debt-fueled spending. With the Bank of Japan moving away from negative interest rates, the limits on spending are becoming more apparent, and concerns about Japan's fiscal health are growing. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has warned of the "terror" of higher interest rates, comparing Japan's budget situation to Greece. An election in Japanâ€™s upper house in July will test the ruling party, which has relied on spending to quell populist opposition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Tokyo University of Agriculture suggests that cats use scent to differentiate their owners from strangers. The researchers found that cats spent twice as long smelling samples from strangers compared to their owners and favored their right nostrils when sniffing scents from unfamiliar humans. This nostril preference may correspond to how animals process new information. The study also indicated that a cat's personality influences how they interact with odors, with more "neurotic" male cats repeatedly returning to smell tubes, while more "agreeable" ones rarely did.</p>
