          <p>A security guard fatally shot a gunman who attempted to attack a church in Wayne, Michigan, preventing further casualties. The incident occurred at the CrossPointe Community Church during Sunday morning services, with the suspect driving his truck into the building and opening fire. One victim was shot in the leg, but the security guard's quick action neutralized the threat, and law enforcement sources have confirmed that no explosives were involved. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, which comes amid a heightened threat environment following recent U.S. military action in Iran, although it is not immediately known if the two events are connected.</p>

          <p>The United States executed a complex and unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear sites, employing deceptive tactics and precision strikes. B-2 stealth bombers, supported by refueling tankers and fighter jets, delivered massive ordnance penetrators to key underground uranium enrichment plants. The operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved a decoy plan and minimized communication to maintain secrecy. U.S. officials claim the attack devastated the Iranian nuclear program, while Iran denies significant damage and vows retaliation.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance said his country was only at war with Iran's nuclear program, adding that the program had been pushed back following US airstrikes ordered by President Donald Trump. Vance accused Iran of not negotiating in good faith, which he said served as a catalyst for US strikes. Vance explained that Trump made the final decision to strike Iran right before the strikes took place and that Washington has received some "indirect" messages from Tehran since the strikes. He did not elaborate on the content of the messages.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefing was big on what happened but short on detail of what happens next. The focus now is on what follows and that's not so clear. Full battle damage assessment will reveal the complete picture - only then can the mission's success be measured in full, mindful that Iran had shifted at least some of its enriched uranium in the days before the strike. A consistent line was that the US wanted Iran to negotiate peace, coupled with the threat of further aggression if it doesn't. The Americans want this attack to have been a "one-and-done".</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance asserts that the U.S. is "at war" with Iran's nuclear program, not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While President Trump claimed the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," Vance suggests the U.S. has "substantially delayed" Iran's nuclear weapons development. Satellite images show damage to Iranian sites, but the extent of the damage remains unclear. Experts debate whether the strikes will lead Iran to negotiate or to pursue nuclear weapons more aggressively.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran following recent strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing diplomacy.

Rubio reiterated that the U.S. has no immediate plans for further attacks unless provoked, and that the strikes aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions.

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the increasing trend of immigration agents wearing masks, arguing that it undermines their authority and poses a threat to public safety. The author contends that masked agents contradict Department of Homeland Security regulations and can provide cover for violating constitutional rights. The lack of uniformity in the masks worn by agents can cause confusion and increase the risk of interference in law enforcement actions. The piece also notes the increasing number of non-criminals being targeted by immigration agents, and the potential for impersonation by individuals seeking to commit crimes.</p>

          <p>In the hours after its military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials suggested Iran ought to embrace a diplomatic off-ramp rather than choosing to retaliate. Vance suggested the U.S. was not interested in a broader war or a conflict beyond its strikes on the Iranian nuclear program. At a Pentagon news conference, Hegseth said the nuclear program was “the line the president set” and that the “overwhelming” military action should invite peace. The defense secretary did not clarify any potential parameters for negotiations but said the U.S. was sending messages directly to Iran and “giving them every opportunity to come to the table.”</p>

This claim was shared by numerous users on X and reported by some news outlets, however, searches of major wire services found no reports about this matter. The earliest record of the text about a "surprise" occurring "tonight" appears to be from an X post appearing on the account Tehran Updates. Snopes has contacted Iran's ministry of foreign affairs by email to ask whether Iranian state TV made the alleged announcement, and will update this story if we learn more information.</p>

Bannon, who had already spoken with Trump by phone ahead of their lunch, thought all of it was a bad idea, according to several people close to him. Sources say he arrived at the White House for his previously scheduled lunch with Trump armed with specific talking points: Israeli intelligence can’t be trusted, he planned to say, and the bunker-buster bomb might not work as planned. A White House official insists that by the time Trump sat down with Bannon for lunch the president had already made a decision to hold off on a strike against Iran.</p>
