          <p>Nepal's primary political parties are formally demanding that the president reinstate the parliament, which was dissolved following widespread, deadly protests against corruption. The coalition of eight parties argues the president's action, based on the recommendation of the new interim prime minister, was unconstitutional and contrary to judicial precedent. While the dissolution was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, established political factions insist that addressing protesters' concerns, including new elections, must happen through the democratically elected institution. The new interim government now faces the immense challenge of restoring order and navigating the country's fragile constitutional framework.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally questioned him about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to insiders. The prime minister is said to have posed three specific questions regarding Mandelson's continued contact with Epstein post-conviction and his alleged stay at one of Epstein's properties. Despite Mandelson's answers being deemed sufficient at the time, his subsequent dismissal was triggered by newly revealed emails showing supportive messages sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. Downing Street sources now suggest Mandelson was not fully transparent, raising serious questions about the vetting process and the Prime Minister's judgment.</p>

          <p>Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez and other local officials are calling for a thorough investigation into the death of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican national who was shot and killed by ICE agents during a traffic stop. The incident, which occurred near a school, has sparked community outrage, with officials stating that a traffic violation should never result in a death sentence. ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer with his car, but surveillance footage has raised questions about the agents' actions. The shooting took place amid an intensified ICE enforcement campaign in the Chicago area, heightening tensions within immigrant communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A persistent monsoonal flow is creating significant flood risks across parts of the Western U.S. this weekend, with eastern New Mexico and western Texas under a Level 2 threat for excessive rainfall. Storms in this region could produce one to two inches of rain per hour, posing a particular danger to areas with wildfire burn scars like Ruidoso, New Mexico. Meanwhile, southern Florida continues to experience hot and stormy conditions, though the heaviest rainfall has likely passed after a week that saw over 10 inches in the Miami area. The rest of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see warmer, above-average temperatures, diminishing the recent fall-like weather.</p>

          <p>Central London saw a massive demonstration organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, drawing an estimated crowd of over 100,000 people for his "Unite the Kingdom" rally. A significant police presence was deployed to manage the event and a nearby counter-protest by Stand Up To Racism, which attracted around 5,000 participants. Tensions flared as some of Robinson's supporters reportedly threw projectiles and assaulted officers while trying to breach police cordons separating the two groups, leading to nine arrests. The event, which featured a video message from Elon Musk calling for a new election, highlighted the deep social and political divisions currently present in the UK.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was fatally shot this week, was a prominent and polarizing figure in American politics and a key ally of President Donald Trump. He co-founded Turning Point USA, a powerful youth organization that promotes conservative principles on college campuses and played a significant role in mobilizing young voters for the Republican party. Kirk's daily podcast and social media presence often featured debates on controversial topics like gun control, gender, and race, drawing both fervent support and fierce criticism. A devout evangelical Christian, he was also a family man, and his widow, Erika Kirk, has vowed to continue his mission, stating his death has unleashed a new wave of determination.</p>

          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill aimed at regulating powerful "frontier" artificial intelligence models by mandating transparency from their developers. The legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, requires major AI companies to publish detailed safety and security reports addressing potential catastrophic risks, such as AI-enabled bioweapons or cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Proponents argue it is a necessary, light-touch approach to ensure accountability before a disaster occurs, while some industry groups oppose it, citing compliance costs and potential stifling of innovation. As a hub for AI development, California's regulatory moves are seen as a bellwether for future national policy in the United States.</p>

          <p>In a major setback for Georgia prosecutors, a Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges against 61 individuals who protested the construction of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office lacked the proper authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to do so. This decision effectively collapses the state's two-year effort to prosecute the protest movement using a law typically reserved for organized crime. While some lesser charges remain, the ruling is being hailed by defense attorneys and activists as a victory against prosecutorial overreach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While lip oils have gained popularity for providing shine and hydration, some users, particularly women of color, have reported developing hyperpigmentation on their lips. According to Dr. Rebecca Small, a clinical professor at UCSF, this may be due to the product's ingredients and a lack of sun protection. Because the skin on lips is thin and lacks natural defense against UV rays, applying an oil without SPF can magnify sun exposure and lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Consumers are advised to check ingredients, avoid irritants like fragrances, and choose lip products that contain a broad-spectrum SPF to protect against sun damage.</p>

          <p>The British mixed 4x400m relay team finished in fifth place at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, narrowly missing a podium spot and ending a successful run of global relay medals for the nation. Despite qualifying for the final with a strong time, the quartet of Lewis Davey, Emily Newnham, Toby Harries, and Nicole Yeargin could not close the gap in a competitive race. The United States claimed the gold medal, equaling the championship record, while the Netherlands and Belgium secured silver and bronze, respectively. The British athletes expressed disappointment with the result, acknowledging they had hoped to be more competitive in the final.</p>

          <p>Following a historic drought that severely restricted traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with significant infrastructure investments to ensure future water security. The plans include building a new dam and tunnel system to supplement the canal's main water source, Lake Gatun, at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion. Additionally, the authority is developing a "land bridge," featuring a natural gas pipeline and new port terminals, to transport commodities across the isthmus without relying on the canal's water levels. These ambitious projects are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change and maintain the canal's critical role in global trade.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football program is in crisis following a disastrous 35-10 home loss to New Mexico, dropping the team to an 0-3 record for the season. The performance was marked by a lack of discipline, with 13 penalties, and an inability to stop the run, as the Bruins gave up nearly 300 rushing yards. This article argues that second-year head coach DeShaun Foster appears overwhelmed and unable to solve the team's fundamental problems. With the team on track for its worst season in over a century, pressure is intensifying not only on Foster but also on the athletic director who hired him, as the program's struggles deepen.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah has deeply unsettled the state's political identity, which leaders like Governor Spencer Cox have long promoted as a model of civility and consensus known as "The Utah Way." The act of political violence, allegedly carried out by a young man from a local Mormon family, has shattered the perception of Utah as a sanctuary shielded from the nation's toxic political rage. This article explores how the state, founded by pioneers seeking refuge from persecution, is now grappling with the realization that the country's deep-seated hostility and online radicalization have breached its ideological defenses, leaving its leaders to question the path forward.</p>

          <p>An FBI operation to incinerate two pounds of seized methamphetamine at a Montana animal shelter went wrong, sending a cloud of smoke into the building and hospitalizing fourteen shelter workers. The incident occurred when smoke from the incinerator, normally used for animal carcasses, was drawn into the facility's ventilation system. The Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter is now closed indefinitely pending contamination testing, and its 75 animals have been relocated. City officials are investigating why the incinerator was not operating at the correct temperature to prevent toxic emissions and why a fan meant to prevent such backflow was not available.</p>

          <p>For Americans whose families were impacted by past eras of xenophobic U.S. policy, the recent escalation of ICE raids under the Trump administration is a painful echo of history.

They draw direct parallels between the family separations and community terror of the past and the tactics used today.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite his immense wealth, the precise source of Jeffrey Epstein's nearly $600 million fortune remains enigmatic, though it was primarily built by managing the finances of a few billionaire clients. His key patrons were Victoria's Secret founder Les Wexner and Apollo Global Management's Leon Black, from whom he collected hundreds of millions in fees for purported tax and estate planning services. After his 2008 conviction for child sexual procurement, Epstein leveraged his extensive network to act as a client developer for banks like JPMorgan Chase, connecting them with global leaders and billionaires. This network, facilitated by gifts and access, was ultimately more valuable than his financial acumen.</p>

          <p>After leaving a career in asset management, Neil Hershman purchased a 16 Handles franchise at age 23 and, by 27, acquired the entire company. He has since revitalized the "stale" frozen yogurt brand, boosting its systemwide sales to over $20 million annually. Hershman's strategy involved introducing innovative, limited-edition flavors and revamping the company's digital marketing, leading to increased store traffic and a 10% rise in same-store sales. His success comes as the frozen yogurt market shows signs of a resurgence, driven by consumer nostalgia and a perception of it being a healthier dessert alternative.</p>

This article chronicles the struggles of major American dictionary publishers like Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com, which have faced layoffs and ownership changes amid falling ad revenue and competition from search engine answer boxes. While lexicography is more advanced than ever, the business model to support it is crumbling, with the number of full-time lexicographers in the U.S. plummeting. This decline raises urgent questions about who will serve as the authoritative watchdog for language in an era of misinformation.</p>

This is the same station where a 2022 report uncovered a culture of misogyny and racism, leading to a major scandal for the force.

          <p>The UK Labour government is facing a growing crisis over its handling of the Lord Mandelson scandal, with scrutiny intensifying on what Prime Minister Keir Starmer knew about the ambassador's ties to Jeffrey Epstein and when he knew it. Despite two separate vetting processes, damaging emails from Mandelson to the convicted sex offender were not uncovered by officials, leading to accusations of carelessness and poor judgment within Downing Street. The prime minister's initial staunch defense of Mandelson just before the emails were published has undermined his authority. The episode has derailed the government's agenda and created significant internal disquiet just ahead of the party's annual conference.</p>
