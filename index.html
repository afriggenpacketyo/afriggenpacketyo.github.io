          <p>Former President Trump, alongside major technology and energy executives, announced over $90 billion in new investments for Pennsylvania at a summit at Carnegie Mellon University. The initiative aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy in the state by leveraging its energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear power. Key projects include the construction of energy-intensive data centers for AI and a new worker training innovation center. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers across the state, signaling a major push for technological and economic development in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Vance Boelter on six counts for the targeted shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses last month, which resulted in two deaths. The attack killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson stated that the indictment is the first step in potentially seeking the death penalty for Boelter. The case is being treated as an unprecedented act of political extremism and violence in the state's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information from the Jeffrey Epstein files that she deems credible, amidst pressure from his supporters for more transparency. This follows a Justice Department review which concluded there was no evidence of a "client list" and that Epstein's death was a suicide. Trump addressed the issue by suggesting the files were fabricated by political opponents but deferred to Bondi's judgment on releasing their contents. The administration's handling of the files has caused some internal friction and public calls for greater disclosure from political figures and lawmakers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union's strategy of pressuring China over its perceived support for Russia's war in Ukraine could be counterproductive to the EU's own economic interests. Ahead of a China-EU summit, Brussels has accused Beijing of enabling Russia's war economy, a stance that may not effectively alter China's geopolitical calculations. The author suggests that this confrontational approach complicates efforts to address the EU's trade deficit with China and secure critical supply chains. The piece posits that both the U.S. and China may benefit from the ongoing stalemate, questioning the effectiveness of the EU's pressure tactics.</p>

          <p>In a significant setback for the Trump administration, a procedural vote on a package of cryptocurrency-related bills failed in the House of Representatives. A dozen Republican hard-liners joined Democrats to block the legislation, defying calls from both President Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson to advance the measures. The bills, including the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, were intended to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. Conservative opponents of the measure cited concerns that the legislation did not include a sufficient ban on a potential Central Bank Digital Currency.</p>

          <p>During a confirmation hearing, Democratic senators intensely questioned Mike Waltz, the nominee for U.N. ambassador, about his involvement in a Signal group chat where sensitive military information was shared. The controversy centers on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly disclosing details about an upcoming airstrike against the Houthis in the chat, which accidentally included a journalist. Senators expressed concern over the use of a commercial app for such communications and pressed Waltz on his judgment and accountability. Waltz maintained that no classified information was shared, a point of contention with lawmakers who argued the details were demonstrably sensitive.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghan nationals. The administration had planned to end the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court has paused the move for one week to review legal briefs. This decision provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans who rely on TPS for deportation protection and work authorization.

The move faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about cutting effective programs like PEPFAR, which combats global HIV/AIDS.

An NPR investigation revealed that this access to the National Payment Service system is unprecedented and could jeopardize farmers' livelihoods if misused.

This failure has renewed concerns about Pixar's ability to launch successful new franchises, especially after a tumultuous creative process that saw major script and directorial changes.

This directive comes as the Texas Legislature prepares for a special session, where a revised map could be considered. While constitutionally permissible, such a mid-decade, politically motivated redistricting is unusual and could trigger similar actions by Democrat-controlled states.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced it will soon restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, causing its stock to climb over 6%. The decision follows an indication from the U.S. Commerce Department that it will resume reviewing license applications for such exports. This development signals a potential loosening of the strict export controls imposed by the Trump administration, which had previously cited national security concerns. The chip industry, including competitor Nvidia, has been urging the administration to ease restrictions that have impacted revenues, with both companies having developed specific chips for the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired 17 immigration court judges in a move that the judges' union calls outrageous and detrimental to the justice system. The firings occurred across ten states and were made "without cause," according to the union. This action comes as the administration intensifies its immigration enforcement efforts and as the courts grapple with a massive backlog of approximately 3.5 million cases. While Congress recently allocated funds to hire more judges, the union argues that these dismissals will only worsen delays, as recruiting and training new judges is a lengthy process.</p>
