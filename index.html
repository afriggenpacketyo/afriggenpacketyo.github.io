          <p>A Department of Justice employee, Sean Charles Dunn, has been fired and faces a felony charge for allegedly assaulting a federal officer by throwing a sandwich at him in Washington, D.C. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination, stating that disrespect for law enforcement will not be tolerated in the administration. The article provides context, noting the incident occurred amid heightened tensions over the deployment of federal forces in the city, a move justified by President Trump on the grounds of rising crime, despite police statistics showing a decrease. The summary also contrasts Dunn's firing with the department's recent support for another employee involved in the January 6th riot.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors, including many military veterans, of over $200 million. Ryan Wear, former owner of Water Station Management, is accused of selling non-existent water vending machines and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier ones. His alleged co-conspirator, former fund manager Jordan Chirico, is accused of concealing his financial stake in the company while facilitating the fraud. Both men face charges that could result in up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the staggering fraud.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed a Mississippi law requiring age verification for all social media users to take effect, refusing a request from tech industry group NetChoice to block a lower court's ruling. The law is significantly broader than a recent Texas ruling focused only on sexually explicit sites, applying to common platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Critics, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a concurrence, argue the law is likely unconstitutional as it restricts access to a wide range of information and protected speech. For now, the law, which also requires platforms to prevent minors from seeing "harmful materials" without parental consent, will be enforced.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the end of their shop-in-shop partnership, which will conclude in August 2026. The deal, initiated in 2021, saw the opening of over 600 Ulta Beauty locations within Target stores, a key strategy for the retailer to drive foot traffic and boost its beauty category sales. The dissolution of the partnership comes as Target faces significant challenges, including declining sales, falling store traffic, and a stock value less than half of its 2021 peak. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target may have contributed to the decision, adding another challenge for the company's next CEO.</p>

The article explains that the company's strategy of shifting between natural gas and crude oil production has not been effective in the current market, as it has struggled to align its output with commodity demand. Citing lackluster price dynamics and the potential for President Trump's foreign policy to further suppress oil prices, the club is exiting the position at a loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant development in the corruption case against Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price, county prosecutors reportedly tried to force his wife, Del Richardson, to testify before a grand jury earlier this year. Price faces charges of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest, alleging he voted on matters that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. New documents also revealed that Richardson herself was considered a suspect in the investigation as recently as 2022, though she was never charged. Price has pleaded not guilty to all counts, and his defense attorney is challenging the legality of the grand jury proceedings.</p>

          <p>A hiker has died in Tennessee's Savage Gulf State Park after being bitten by a venomous snake, identified as a timber rattlesnake. According to emergency officials, a witness reported that the man had picked up the snake, which then bit him on the hand. First responders transported him to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, with officials suggesting a possible allergic reaction as a contributing factor. The timber rattlesnake is the largest and most dangerous venomous snake in Tennessee, though bites are rare and typically not fatal, according to wildlife agencies.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has altered its controversial sponsorship deal with Rwanda, ending the prominent "Visit Rwanda" branding on its kits. The move follows significant pressure from fans and human rights activists concerned about Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instead of severing ties completely, the club announced a new partnership focused on football development through its youth academy in Kigali. Analysts suggest the decision was a strategic response to public criticism rather than a moral stand, highlighting the complex relationship between major sports clubs and nation-state branding.</p>

          <p>Software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation soaring past $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been its government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's AI-powered tools have also attracted significant interest from retail investors, contributing to a stock price that gives it a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. This indicates investors are paying a substantial premium based on high expectations for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions, a major barometer for the collectible car market, are underway with expectations of declining sales for the third consecutive year. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as baby boomer collectors age out and are replaced by millennials and Gen Zers who favor newer, more practical supercars from the 1980s and later. This has led to falling prices for classic cars from the 1950s and 1960s, with only one car this year estimated to sell for over $10 million, a significant drop from previous years. The market is seeing a clear rotation in taste and value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the U.K. have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, reversing a consistent trend. The data shows boys secured 28.4% of top grades compared to 28.2% for girls, a narrow but significant shift. Analysts suggest a primary factor is the sustained growth in the popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are disproportionately taken by male students and tend to award a higher percentage of top grades. While more girls take A-levels overall, the increasing gender divide in subject choice appears to have influenced this year's top-level results.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Rebecca Solnit argues that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C. is an act of profound hypocrisy and an illegitimate power grab. The author contends that the intervention is based on false narratives about crime, noting that violent crime is actually at a 30-year low. Solnit draws a parallel between this action and the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which she calls the most violent day in the city's modern history, also instigated by Trump based on lies. The piece frames the move as part of a broader right-wing war on diverse, Democratic-leaning cities, using claims of disorder to justify authoritarian control.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. and placing its police under federal control is a move made possible by the capital's unique legal status. Unlike states, Washington, D.C. is a federal district, and the Home Rule Act allows a president to assume control during emergencies. Legal experts explain that this authority cannot be easily replicated in other cities like New York or Los Angeles, where governors command their respective National Guards. While Trump has threatened similar interventions elsewhere, doing so would face significant legal challenges under laws like the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts domestic use of the military for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic's archives delves into the historical transformation of the word "genius." Originally referring to a person's unique inner spirit or guiding daemon, the concept shifted in the 19th century towards denoting an individual with extraordinary, almost magical, inherited abilities. This change was influenced by the work of figures like Francis Galton, whose study of "Hereditary Genius" led to the development of eugenics, a dark chapter in the quest to understand exceptionalism. The essay concludes by reflecting on the modern understanding that genius is a complex mix of heritable traits, hard work, and the significant role of luck and historical context.</p>

After his name was repeatedly nominated by classmates, the class leadership ensured he was recognized as an Honorary Graduate, with a certificate being mailed to his parents. The act serves as a poignant tribute to Wang's heroism and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>The European Union is sending two firefighting planes to Spain to help combat devastating wildfires that have been intensified by a prolonged heatwave. Spain activated the EU's disaster assistance mechanism for the first time as the death toll from the fires rose to three, with a volunteer firefighter succumbing to severe burns. Authorities have arrested several individuals on suspicion of arson, while thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes across the country. The situation remains critical, with forecasters predicting high temperatures and moderate winds will continue to fuel the blazes across southern Europe.</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz, who died after self-harming at a mental health hospital, was unlawfully killed. Ruth was supposed to be under constant observation at the since-closed Huntercombe Hospital but was left alone for approximately 15 minutes by an agency staff member who was on his first shift and had used fake credentials to get the job. The jury found that insufficient staff training and unsuitable care contributed to her death. Her parents described being trapped in a system that was meant to keep their daughter safe but instead harmed her.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece champions a new climate report from the Department of Energy for taking what the author describes as a revolutionary middle-ground position. The report, produced by a small group of independent scientists, affirms that human activity contributes to warming but concludes that it is not necessarily an impending catastrophe and that extreme weather events have not demonstrably increased in frequency or intensity. The author argues this nuanced perspective is a welcome alternative to polarized narratives of either denial or alarmism. The article praises the effort to inject more open debate into climate science and policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For consumers struggling with debt amid high interest rates, this article examines two primary relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed, which can save money but severely damages credit scores and may create a tax liability. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, focuses on creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, which preserves credit but requires repaying the debt in full. The better choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The two leading plant-based meat companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are pursuing different strategies to navigate a stagnant market and address consumer criticism. Beyond Meat is pivoting towards simpler, "cleaner" ingredients and more neutral-flavored products, even rebranding to just "Beyond" to move away from direct meat mimicry. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on creating the most meat-like experience possible, launching more indulgent products and sticking with its genetically engineered heme ingredient. These divergent bets on whether health-consciousness or taste is the key driver will shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% in July, its largest jump in over three years and far exceeding economists' forecasts. This surge suggests that President Trump's tariffs are increasingly translating into higher costs for businesses, which are likely to be passed on to consumers soon. The report indicates that the ability of importers to absorb tariff costs is diminishing, pointing toward broader inflation pressures in the near future. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, creating a dilemma between curbing inflation and stimulating the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following a public outcry and criticism from funeral directors who labeled it a "fat tax." The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6-foot-wide plot compared to a standard 5-foot one, a move the council initially defended by citing increased demand and higher obesity rates. After a BBC investigation highlighted residents' concerns about discrimination and fairness, the council announced it would not proceed with the plans. The incident sparked a broader conversation about how local authorities handle burial costs for larger individuals.</p>
