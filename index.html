        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a significant rally after President Trump approved the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a 'golden share' granting the U.S. president veto power over key decisions, such as relocating headquarters, moving production or jobs overseas, renaming the company, and closing or idling plants. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the government's rights on social media, emphasizing the president's control. While Trump avoids calling it a merger, U.S. Steel confirmed it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with all regulatory approvals received and completion expected promptly. Optimism regarding the deal's successful closure and potential benefits to U.S. Steel's future is reflected in the market's positive reaction.</p>

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter was apprehended in Sibley County, Minnesota, as the suspect in the shooting of Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The Hortmans were killed in what officials are calling a "politically motivated assassination," while the Hoffmans were hospitalized and in stable condition. Boelter was armed but taken into custody without the use of force after a large manhunt involving over 20 SWAT teams. Authorities believe Boelter acted alone, donning a latex mask and law enforcement-style uniform before the attacks, but they are investigating the possibility of any indirect assistance.</p>

          <p>The stands of several major Israeli defense firms, including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), were blocked off at the Paris Air Show, reportedly due to an order from the French government following a disagreement over the displays. Israel's Defense Ministry stated that the exhibition organizers requested the removal of offensive weapons systems from the Israeli pavilions, a demand Israel rejected. In response, the conference staff erected black walls overnight, obscuring the pavilions at the event's start. The ministry criticized the decision as politically motivated and driven by commercial considerations, suggesting it aimed to exclude Israeli offensive weapons that compete with French industries.</p>

While complete eradication is unlikely, these efforts are showing positive demographic shifts, with fewer large pythons observed in certain areas.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are introducing a bill to cut off federal housing grants to sanctuary cities, such as Los Angeles, that do not comply with federal immigration law and authorities. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Bill Hagerty and Rep. Ralph Norman, targets federal housing grants provided by the community development block grant program, arguing that cities encouraging illegal immigration should not be rewarded with federal subsidies. This measure aligns with President Trump's broader efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities by threatening to revoke federal funding. The bill aims to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions impeding the sharing of immigration status information or compliance with DHS requests will lose federal grant funding.</p>

While energy efficiency has generally improved over the past half-century, recent political shifts have led to the Trump administration rescinding numerous energy-efficiency rules. The debate centers on balancing energy savings with appliance performance and consumer choice, as some argue that stricter standards can compromise functionality. The article highlights the importance of programs like Energy Star, which provide objective assessments of appliance efficiency, and explores the potential economic and environmental consequences of eliminating these standards.</p>
