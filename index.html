          <p>A Commerce Department official has refuted a Wall Street Journal report claiming the Trump administration was negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti. This denial came after the report caused a surge in the stocks of several quantum firms. While the administration has previously taken stakes in industries vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, it is not currently pursuing this strategy with the nascent quantum computing sector. The industry is seen as critical for future military and technological applications but has yet to generate significant revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Republican lawmakers, including leaders of congressional commissions on China, has sent a letter urging President Trump to confront Chinese President Xi Jinping over Americans they consider unjustly detained or banned from leaving China. The letter highlights several specific cases and accuses Beijing of using detentions and exit bans as tools of leverage, calling the Chinese Communist Party the "world's largest hostage-taker." This appeal comes ahead of an anticipated summit between the two leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, intended to stabilize escalating tensions between the nations.</p>

          <p>The Colombian government has formally requested that the United States cease lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats in international waters, following U.S. strikes that killed five people. This brings the total death toll from such operations to 37, according to U.S. figures. The demand comes amid a severe diplomatic fallout between Colombian President Gustavo Petro and President Trump, who have exchanged sharp threats, leading Washington to decertify Colombia as an ally in the drug war. Colombia is urging a return to diplomatic dialogue to jointly combat drug trafficking, while families of victims question the U.S. narrative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rivian Automotive is reportedly laying off over 600 employees, representing about 4% of its total workforce, as it navigates a challenging electric vehicle market. The company is facing headwinds from the elimination of a federal EV incentive, slower-than-expected consumer demand, and significant financial losses, including a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter. Despite a year-over-year increase in third-quarter sales, Rivian has narrowed its 2025 delivery forecast and projected a larger adjusted core loss for the year. These measures reflect broader struggles within the EV sector amid changing regulations and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in 2023. The White House stated the pardon was an exercise of constitutional authority, framing the prosecution as part of the Biden Administration's "war on cryptocurrency." The statement argued that the case against Zhao involved no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims and that the previous administration's actions had damaged the U.S.'s reputation for innovation. This move is seen as a significant development in the relationship between the administration and the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>The final New York City mayoral debate between former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani generated significant social media buzz, largely focused on the candidates' aggressive personal attacks. Mamdani confronted Cuomo about the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor, earning praise from his supporters for his directness. In turn, Cuomo criticized Mamdani for his alleged ties to radical politics and past controversial statements, with some observers, including Republican figures, believing Cuomo dominated the exchange. The contentious nature of the debate highlighted the deep divisions and personal animosities that have defined the race for mayor.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines, long known as a discount carrier, is implementing significant changes to appeal to premium travelers and increase revenue. The airline is abandoning its decades-old open boarding policy in favor of assigned seating, introducing an extra legroom section, and has already begun charging for checked bags. These updates, which also include larger overhead bins and better Wi-Fi, are designed to make Southwest more competitive with other major airlines. While these changes will offer more options for passengers willing to pay for upgrades, they mark a fundamental shift away from the airline's original low-cost, no-frills model.</p>

          <p>Ofwat, the economic regulator for England and Wales, has ordered water companies to refund more than £260 million to customers due to failures in meeting targets for pollution and leaks.

Thames Water faces the largest penalty at £75.2 million. While some of the refund has been applied to current bills, the rest will be deducted next year, though overall bills are still expected to rise significantly to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>A new study published in *Nature* indicates that mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, like those from Pfizer and Moderna, may significantly improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Researchers found that late-stage melanoma and lung cancer patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine while undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment had substantially higher three-year survival rates. The study suggests the mRNA vaccine acts as an "alarm," activating the immune system to better recognize and attack tumor cells, potentially turning previously unresponsive "cold" tumors "hot." A nationwide clinical trial is being planned to validate these promising findings.</p>

Adams, who dropped his own reelection bid amid low polling and a federal indictment that was later dropped, has been an outspoken critic of Mamdani.

          <p>Shares of luxury group Kering surged 8.7% after the company reported a smaller-than-expected sales decline, fueling optimism about its turnaround efforts. Sales at its flagship brand, Gucci, fell 14% but showed a marked improvement from the previous quarter's 25% plunge, beating analyst forecasts. While the overall results are still below the market average, investors were encouraged by the positive trajectory across Kering's major brands, including Saint Laurent and Balenciaga. The performance suggests that new management's strategies to refresh the iconic fashion house are beginning to yield positive results for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the adage that money can't buy happiness, concluding that wealth can indeed increase well-being, but only under specific conditions. Citing psychological research, the author argues that materialism and the pursuit of money for reasons like social comparison, power, or overcoming self-doubt are negatively correlated with life satisfaction. However, earning money for security or to support family does not have the same negative effect. The key to happiness is not the amount of money one has, but rather one's motives for earning it and how it is spent, with experiences and time being more valuable than possessions.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Jeremy Strong reflected on his intensive, immersive approach to acting, which he acknowledges can sound "witchy." For his roles as Roy Cohn in "The Apprentice" and Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau in "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," he engaged in deep research and preparation to fully inhabit the characters. While filming the Springsteen biopic, he had the unique opportunity to consult directly with Landau and Springsteen on set, using their insights to add emotional depth to his performance. Strong explained that his goal is to create an "anechoic chamber" where the character takes possession of him, a process he finds essential for authenticity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study from George Washington University and Kaiser Permanente suggests that contaminated meat from grocery stores may be a major source of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Researchers compared E. coli from UTI patients in Southern California with samples from retail meats and found that approximately one in five infections could be traced to food-borne strains. The study highlights that UTIs should be considered a food safety issue, not just a matter of personal hygiene. Contamination was highest in poultry, and the research indicated that food-borne UTIs disproportionately affect women and residents of lower-income areas.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is betraying capitalist principles through policies of state intervention and ownership. The author cites the government taking a 10% equity stake in Intel via CHIPS Act funds, becoming the largest shareholder in a rare-earth mining company, and setting price floors for commodities as examples of "top-down industrial control." The piece contends that these actions, which mimic the state-owned enterprise models of China, substitute political control for market choice and will ultimately stifle innovation. The author concludes that such interventionist industrial policy is a departure from the free-market legacy that made the U.S. prosperous. (not investment advice)</p>

PC Martin Borg was recorded enthusiastically describing another officer using excessive force and offering to falsify a statement to justify it. Both officers were dismissed with immediate effect, with the hearing's chair describing their conduct as an "utter disgrace" that caused significant harm to public confidence in the police.</p>

          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the Kenyan athlete who holds the women's marathon world record, has been banned from the sport for three years after testing positive for a prohibited diuretic. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) rejected her explanation that she had inadvertently taken her housemaid's medication. Because the failed drug test occurred after her record-setting run in Chicago, she will be allowed to keep her world record. The AIU noted it will continue to investigate suspicious material found on her phone related to testosterone and potential doping "programs," suggesting further violations may yet be uncovered.</p>

          <p>Two government watchdog groups have warned that a top federal prosecutor's use of an auto-deleting messaging app may have been illegal. Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, used Signal with an eight-hour auto-delete setting to communicate with a journalist about a high-profile case. Groups like American Oversight argue this practice raises serious concerns about violations of the Federal Records Act, as official government business communications must be preserved. The conduct is particularly alarming given Halligan's role in pursuing politically sensitive prosecutions against perceived enemies of the President, heightening concerns about unethical behavior.</p>

          <p>The Prince William County School Board in Virginia has officially censured its vice chairman, Tracy L. Blake, for "unbecoming" conduct following a dispute with another board member. The conflict arose over the potential formation of a high school chapter of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Fellow board member Erica Tredinnick, who supports the chapter, accused Blake, who opposes it, of being aggressive and cursing at her after a meeting. This local incident reflects broader national tensions over free speech and political organizing in schools, particularly surrounding the controversial legacy of Turning Point's late co-founder, Charlie Kirk.</p>
