          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has advanced to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon after a grueling five-set victory over Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry. Norrie, the British number three, secured the win under the roof on Court One after missing a match point in the third set, demonstrating significant resilience. His victory keeps British hopes alive in the men's singles draw following the exit of the final home player in the women's singles. Norrie is now set to face reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the next round.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett indicated that a number of trade deals are expected to be finalized ahead of a key tariff deadline this week. He stated that the "rough outlines" of agreements are clear, with existing deals serving as guidelines for other nations. For countries where negotiations are not sufficiently advanced, the U.S. will send letters outlining its terms, with President Trump suggesting these could go to around a dozen partners. Hassett expressed optimism that the strategy is encouraging companies to onshore production and create jobs in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood along the Guadalupe River in Texas has resulted in a deadly disaster at Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp. The camp, known for providing a wholesome atmosphere for spiritual growth and outdoor activities, was devastated when floodwaters rose with little warning. Among the deceased is eight-year-old Renee Smajstrla, whose family said she was "having the time of her life" just before the tragedy. The disaster has prompted questions about the safety of situating numerous youth camps so close to the river.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas, which have killed nearly 70 people, underscore the limitations of forecasting in the climate crisis era. Analysis shows the rainfall was an exceedingly rare event, with some areas receiving the equivalent of a 1-in-1,000-year downpour. Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely watches and warnings, including a top-level Flash Flood Emergency, the sheer intensity and specific location of the rainfall proved difficult to predict precisely.

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) has condemned an attack on a Deutsche Welle (DW) correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The news crew, who were clearly identified as press, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a protest against settler violence; they escaped unharmed but their vehicle was damaged. DW's Director General and Germany's ambassador to Israel both condemned the attack, calling on the Israeli government to guarantee the safety of journalists and uphold freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is forcing citizens to undertake perilous, illicit boat journeys to Europe in search of medical treatment. The story of a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, whose family made the dangerous crossing to Italy, has highlighted the crisis. Since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, political instability has shattered the country's health services, leaving many facilities non-functional and essential medicines unavailable. This desperation illustrates a systemic failure to meet basic needs, driving families to risk their lives for healthcare access.</p>

          <p>Military experts in China are advocating for structural changes within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to more effectively counter threats from unmanned aircraft. Writing in the PLA Daily, they suggested that establishing specialized counter-drone units is a necessary long-term goal for rapid response. In the interim, they propose integrating counter-drone capabilities into existing forces, such as upgrading electronic warfare units to handle AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming. This focus reflects the increasingly crucial role that drones have played in recent global conflicts, including the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has criticized efforts by the White House to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, calling the move "shortsighted" and "misguided." In an interview, Burns argued that public media, particularly PBS, is a vital service, especially in rural areas where it may be the only broadcast signal available. He defended the institution against claims of political bias and stressed that he could not have produced his extensive body of work without the unique, long-term support that PBS provides, which is unavailable from commercial outlets.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are facing a critical week as a July 9 deadline looms to secure a trade deal with the U.S. and avoid President Trump's threatened tariffs. Uncertainty about Washington's approach has created division within the bloc, with some leaders favoring a deal at any cost while others advocate for holding out for better terms. With only two deals secured globally by the U.S., the EU is now aiming for a more modest framework agreement, similar to the one struck by the UK, to extend negotiations and prevent a full-scale trade war.

          <p>An NPR producer inside Gaza has provided a harrowing first-person account of the dangers Palestinians face seeking food from a new U.S.-supported distribution system. He describes the journey as a "death trap," involving risks of Israeli military fire, armed private contractors, and violent, desperate crowds. The UN has also criticized the program, with hundreds reportedly killed or wounded trying to access the sites. The account details a complete breakdown of order, with armed thieves stealing rations, illustrating the extreme hunger and lawlessness gripping the territory under the current aid system.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city in Peru's Barranca province, which they believe was a key trading hub for early American civilizations. The city, named Peñico, is thought to have connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides insight into the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas, after it was impacted by climate change. The site contains ceremonial temples, residential complexes, and artifacts, adding to Peru's rich archaeological heritage.</p>
