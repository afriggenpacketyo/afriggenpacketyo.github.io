          <p>South Korea's government announced it has successfully negotiated the release of approximately 300 of its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid, part of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign, had strained diplomatic relations, with Seoul expressing regret over the timing and the treatment of its nationals. The detained workers are expected to be flown home on a chartered flight once administrative procedures are complete, and South Korea aims to streamline visa access to prevent future incidents. This event highlights ongoing tensions between US immigration enforcement and international economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska effectively gave the Russian leader what he desired. In an interview, Zelenskyy expressed that Putin's primary goal was to secure a meeting with the US president to project strength, a goal he achieved. These comments were made just before Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine, striking a government building in Kyiv and killing several civilians. Zelenskyy reiterated his call for increased pressure on Russia from the US and European allies, specifically by halting the purchase of Russian energy, which he described as Putin's weapon.</p>

          <p>Convicted serial killer Joseph Naso, currently on death row for the murder of four women, has reportedly confessed to killing a total of 26 victims. The new claim comes from a fellow inmate, William Noguera, who spent over a decade building trust with Naso and documented his confessions in a 300-page dossier. These revelations are featured in a new Oxygen documentary, which details how Noguera worked with a retired FBI investigator to link Naso to several cold cases. Naso, known as the "Alphabet Killer," allegedly described one murder in a written confession, matching the details of a woman's disappearance in the 1970s, providing potential closure for grieving families.</p>

The administration defended the move as a necessary measure to combat counterfeit goods and fentanyl trafficking while reducing the trade deficit. However, the sudden policy change has caused a near-halt in the global postal network, with at least 88 postal operators suspending some services to the U.S. until a new technical solution can be implemented to manage the new tariff requirements.

          <p>President Trump has signaled a significant immigration and crime crackdown in Chicago, sharing a social media post that read, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." While Trump later clarified he is not "going to war" but rather aims to "clean up our cities," the rhetoric has drawn sharp criticism from local and state leaders. This follows the launch of "Patriot 2.0," an ICE enforcement operation in Boston, and the deployment of the National Guard in other cities. An internal memo suggests the Department of Homeland Security is preparing for a 30-day operation near Chicago, heightening tensions and prompting legal threats from Illinois officials.</p>

          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois criticized President Trump's recent statements about sending federal forces to Chicago, stating he "essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation." Her comments followed a Trump social media post suggesting Chicago would soon understand why the Department of Defense was renamed the Department of War. Despite the aggressive rhetoric, Duckworth noted there are currently no concrete indications of an imminent troop deployment for immigration enforcement. She emphasized that local leaders have not been contacted by the administration for coordination, suggesting a lack of genuine interest in collaborative crime-fighting efforts and raising concerns about potential illegal orders.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, using over 800 drones and missiles to strike targets across the country.

          <p>An editorial criticizes President Trump's recent military actions against alleged drug traffickers, arguing it transforms a failed metaphor into a more dangerous reality. The piece references a US military strike that killed 11 alleged traffickers from Venezuela, for which the administration provided little evidence. The author contends that such extrajudicial killings set a dangerous precedent, allowing military force without congressional approval under the guise of being "at war" with cartels. This approach is deemed counterproductive, as it undermines due process, risks innocent lives, and could hinder international cooperation in combating the drug trade, ultimately serving as political spectacle rather than effective policy.</p>

Both golfers birdied the first two extra holes before Lagergren found the water on the third, allowing McIlroy to claim the win. This victory marks McIlroy's fourth of the year and his first since winning the Masters in April, providing a significant morale boost just weeks before the Ryder Cup and a measure of redemption after a narrow loss in last year's tournament.</p>

The email, sent in July to trade groups, law firms, and government agencies, asked recipients to review attached legislative proposals.

          <p>Dr. Vonda Wright, a 58-year-old surgeon and longevity expert, advocates for a diet focused on clean, whole foods to promote a long and healthy life. She consumes one gram of protein per pound of body weight, aiming for 130 grams daily to build and maintain muscle mass. Her typical meals include green leafy vegetables like kale, even for breakfast, along with dairy, eggs, and animal meat. Dr. Wright strictly avoids sugar and simple carbohydrates, stating she can physically feel inflammation and "dullness in my brain" when she consumes them. The only exception she makes is for homemade sourdough bread, which she freezes to lower its glycemic index.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who has been repeatedly spotted driving a Formula 1-style racing car on a public motorway since 2019. The driver was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried vehicle was seen again on the D4 motorway. The man, still in his racing suit and helmet, was taken into custody after a brief standoff with police. Because the driver's helmet had previously obscured his identity, authorities were unable to press charges during earlier sightings. He now faces a fine and potential license suspension for operating a vehicle on the motorway without proper registration or safety features.</p>

          <p>A new study by River reveals that businesses have been purchasing an average of 1,755 Bitcoin daily over the past 20 months, adding over $1.3 trillion to its market capitalization. This surge in corporate adoption has increased business-held reserves from 510,000 to 1.3 million BTC and expanded the number of publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin from 39 to 158 since January 2024. On average, companies are allocating 22% of their net income to Bitcoin investments, treating it as a long-term asset. Analysts suggest that if this institutional investment trend continues, Bitcoin's price could realistically target over $125,000. (not investment advice)</p>

She maintained that the court's role is to decide legal questions, not to form political views on the president's actions. Barrett also discussed the 2022 Dobbs decision, stating it did not make abortion illegal but returned the issue to the democratic process within the states. While declining to comment on specific pending legal issues like tariffs or the deployment of the National Guard, she emphasized that her judicial process involves approaching each case with an open mind, free from external labels of political shifts.</p>

The incident occurred around midnight when police received reports of a vehicle traveling north in the southbound lanes. All individuals involved, including the suspect, were transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect was subsequently booked into the Outagamie County Jail for OWI causing injury, and a section of the interstate was temporarily shut down for investigation.</p>

The alleged shooter, Jonathan Felkel, was arrested and reportedly admitted his actions were racially motivated; he was charged under a local county ordinance. South Carolina and Wyoming are the only two states without a statewide hate crime law, despite a bill passing the state House in 2021.

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is threatening not only entry-level jobs but also the conventional concept of a career ladder, where employees rise from the bottom to the top of a company. A study by venture capital firm SignalFire found a 50% decline in new roles for recent graduates at major tech firms between 2019 and 2024. As AI automates routine tasks and organizations become flatter, the traditional path for upward mobility is disappearing. Experts suggest that while this creates short-term challenges for new entrants into the workforce, it also presents an opportunity for them to become indispensable by mastering AI tools and adapting to a new, less hierarchical corporate structure.

This achievement marks the world's longest open-water journey in such a boat and aims to promote mycelium-based materials, known as AquaFung, as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in marine recreation.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" tariff exemption suggests that while it will impact some small businesses, the widespread panic is misdirected. The author argues that the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected by increased costs on imported goods. The more significant concern is the overall health of the economy and consumers' ability to absorb higher prices. As long as income and wealth continue to grow, the economy can likely withstand the effects of the tariffs, though businesses are advised to diversify suppliers and adapt their pricing strategies.

The research, spanning generational cohorts from the 1930s to the 1990s, revealed that this trend holds true across different cultures for disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance use. Researchers theorize that individuals with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other due to shared understanding and experiences. The findings suggest that environmental factors and social stigma may also play a role in why people with similar psychiatric conditions often form partnerships.</p>
