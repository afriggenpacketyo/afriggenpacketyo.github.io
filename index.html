          <p>Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, is urging federal lawmakers to consider nationwide rules for the rapidly expanding U.S. gambling industry. He argues for federal action on advertising regulations and nationwide exclusion lists to protect gamblers facing addiction, noting that current state-focused policies are easily circumvented. Maynard emphasizes the need for regulators to ensure responsible practices and protect citizens from harm, and he expressed frustration with the industry's resistance to proposed regulations. He believes that artificial intelligence could be used to promote healthy betting behaviors, but also recognizes the uphill battle regulators face in balancing economic benefits with social impact. </p>

          <p>A Jewish family in Colorado Springs is living in fear after discovering their neighbor, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was arrested for allegedly firebombing a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder. The family, who recently moved to the neighborhood seeking a low profile, were visited by the FBI and informed of the attack due to their visible Jewish identity. Soliman, an illegal Egyptian immigrant, admitted to planning the attack and expressed a desire to harm "Zionist people". The family is concerned about the possibility of Soliman's release and the safety of their five young children, and they are now more determined to stand firm in their faith despite the fear. </p>

          <p>Indigenous KawÃ©sqar fishermen in Chile are protesting the salmon farming industry, claiming it pollutes fjords, damages ecosystems, and threatens their ancestral way of life. Reinaldo Caro, one of the last KawÃ©sqar fishermen, highlights the contamination from feces and medication used in the farms. Marine biologist Claudio Carocca emphasizes the vulnerability of these ecosystems to human activity. While the Chilean Salmon Council asserts its commitment to sustainability, critics point to issues like antibiotic use and algal blooms, and the Chilean congress is debating legislation that could limit the industry's expansion. The debate raises questions about economic benefits versus environmental and cultural costs. </p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging Western partners to provide more air defense systems and is calling for accountability for Putin. Despite ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks, both sides have intensified long-range strike operations in recent weeks, and Zelenskyy insists that Russia's attacks cannot be excused as retaliation. </p>

          <p>The UK government plans to allocate an Â£86 billion package to the science and technology sector, aimed at funding research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to Â£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to direct funding to specific areas of expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves says this investment will create jobs and enhance security, and the government expects the annual investment to exceed Â£22.5 billion by 2029. However, research backers have cautioned that the government needs to address issues such as visa costs and university funding to maintain the UK's scientific reputation. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that corruption has become pervasive in the United States, with President Trump allegedly using his position for personal enrichment. The author compares this trend to authoritarian regimes in Russia and Hungary, where leaders have consolidated power and wealth through corruption. The piece suggests that the American political system is being transformed into something that no longer serves the people, with checks and balances weakened and moral frameworks eroded. It raises concerns about the long-term implications for American democracy. </p>

          <p>Rwanda has announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to ongoing tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The move follows Rwanda being blocked from its upcoming turn at the rotating presidency of the bloc. The conflict stems from the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group seizing territory in eastern Congo, leading to broader conflict between the two nations. Rwanda condemned Congo's "instrumentalization" of the bloc, stating it saw no justification for remaining in an organization whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles. </p>

          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after being ingested. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. The study suggests that this could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware has resulted in increased oral exposure to PLA microplastics. </p>
