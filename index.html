          <p>In March, China decreased its holdings of US Treasuries, relinquishing its position as the second-largest foreign holder before the trade war with the US intensified. According to data from the US Department of the Treasury, China's stockpile fell to $765.4 billion, a decrease of $18.9 billion from the previous month, while Britain increased its holdings to $779.3 billion, becoming Americaâ€™s second-largest foreign creditor. This adjustment occurred before US government bonds experienced significant volatility in April following President Trumpâ€™s tariff announcement. Moodyâ€™s Ratings also downgraded the US government's credit rating, further influencing Treasury bond yields.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, which would allow young people to work in other countries for up to two years. This proposal aims to allow young people to move abroad for a limited time, but details on age eligibility and caps are yet to be determined. While the UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia, allowing young people to work in each other's countries, some Conservative Party members have criticized the potential scheme as "free movement through the back door." The first formal summit for European leaders since Brexit will be held in London's Lancaster House.</p>

          <p>A top advisor to the director of national intelligence allegedly ordered a senior analyst to revise an intelligence assessment regarding the relationship between Venezuelaâ€™s government and the Tren de Aragua gang, after initial findings contradicted the White House's justification for deporting migrants. President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, claiming Venezuela directed the gang's criminal activities in the US. The New York Times article reports that the National Intelligence Council reaffirmed its original findings after re-examining evidence, despite pressure from a political appointee to alter the narrative. The controversy has led to internal anger and accusations of politicizing intelligence reports.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it is mobilizing forces for a further advance into Gaza, aiming to seize more territory and displace additional civilians, while also intensifying airstrikes. The military stated that it would not cease operations "until Hamas is no longer a threat and all our hostages are home." These actions come as mediators seek to broker a new truce to halt the conflict that began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. The United Nations has warned of a growing risk of famine in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid, while Hamas refuses to release the remaining hostages without a permanent end to the war and Israeli withdrawal.</p>

The men, arrested in London on May 3, are accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 2024 and February 2025, with Iran being the foreign state in question. One of the suspects also faces an additional charge for surveillance and research intending to commit acts of serious violence in the UK, while the other two are charged with surveillance intending for others to commit serious violence.

          <p>President Trump's Justice Department is focusing on voter fraud, bringing charges against individuals for allegedly voting illegally, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These charges come as Trump pushes the narrative that non-U.S. citizens are voting in large numbers, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. The cases involve individuals who misunderstood election rules, rather than a widespread conspiracy. States are also quantifying noncitizen voting, finding it rarely occurs, but some Republicans are using these cases to push for stricter voter registration requirements.</p>

          <p>The article draws parallels between President Trump's proposed "one big, beautiful bill" and Ronald Reagan's 1981 federal budget, which marked a significant shift in federal fiscal policy. Both initiatives used budget reconciliation to enact substantial changes, including tax cuts and increased military spending. Just as Reagan's program aimed to stimulate the economy through tax cuts, Trump's bill seeks to reshape the federal government, with Elon Musk playing a key role in cutting costs and improving government efficiency. The success of Trump's efforts will depend on his ability to navigate the reconciliation process and garner support in Congress.</p>

          <p>Bruce Knowles, 56, and Ferhat Gumrukguoglu, 32, have been jailed for attempting to import Â£37m of cocaine into the UK after being caught in an inflatable boat off the Suffolk coast.

The court heard that the defendants had conducted a "dry run" of the operation in April before their arrest in June, and they were planning to transport the drugs to another location for distribution.</p>

Sriskandarajah proposes establishing an "extreme wealth line" to define the point at which wealth becomes harmful to society. This line would serve as a basis for policy interventions, such as higher taxes or limitations on inheritance, to curb the excesses of wealth inequality.</p>
