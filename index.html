          <p>Media reports indicate that the United States has paused trade negotiations with India, which were scheduled for late August in New Delhi. This delay comes as bilateral trade tensions have escalated, with the U.S. having levied significant tariffs on Indian goods, citing India's import of Russian oil. The postponement is a setback for Indian manufacturers who were hoping for relief before an additional 25% tariff is set to take effect, adding to an existing 25% levy. Previous rounds of talks have been deadlocked over disagreements on market access for agriculture and India's energy purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, rapidly intensifying to a dangerous Category 5 storm before weakening slightly to a Category 4. The storm is currently passing north of the Leeward Islands, bringing heavy rain to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. While most meteorological models predict Erin will remain several hundred miles off the U.S. East Coast, its presence is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the coastline next week. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches for the Turks and Caicos islands as the powerful system continues its westward track.</p>

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the costumed character "Zombie Hunter," has been sentenced to death for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. The cold case, known as the Phoenix canal murders, was solved after two decades using genetic genealogy to link Miller's DNA to the crime scenes. Miller's defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia. The judge acknowledged the abuse but ultimately found him guilty and imposed the death penalty.</p>

The move is part of the Trump administration's federal crackdown on what the president has described as a crime and homelessness emergency in the nation's capital. This action follows an executive order that federalized local police forces and activated the District of Columbia's own National Guard members. The deployment is intended to protect federal assets and provide a visible presence to deter crime, according to the White House.</p>

Stafford has been unable to practice with the team, and with the season opener approaching, his condition is becoming a significant concern. The situation increases the urgency for backup quarterback Stetson Bennett to be prepared to support veteran Jimmy Garoppolo if Stafford's absence continues.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group, stating it is more than a regular protest organization. Cooper noted that the group has claimed responsibility for incidents leading to serious criminal charges, including violent disorder, which the Crown Prosecution Service has assessed as having a "terrorism connection." The ban, which makes support for the group a criminal offense, has led to over 700 arrests. While rights groups criticize the move as a threat to free expression, Cooper argues the group's activities and internal manuals go beyond legitimate protest.</p>

The wallet was found lodged under the hood of a 2015 Ford Edge while the mechanic was replacing cooling fans. Inside, he found the employee's ID and used Facebook to track down the owner, Richard Guilford, who had lost it in 2014 when it slipped out of his pocket while he worked on the vehicle. The wallet, which traveled over 150,000 miles inside the car, still contained $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards, which the store confirmed are still valid.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese design proposes a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight. This innovative "scissor wing" concept, once explored by NASA, aims to optimize performance across different speed regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at transonic speeds it pivots to 45 degrees to mitigate shock waves. For hypersonic flight at Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider" to handle the extreme conditions of high-speed travel.</p>

          <p>A couples' therapist and executive counselor outlines five common psychological drivers that can lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to risk everything for an affair. These factors include a lifelong pattern of always being "good" and repressing personal identity, which can create a void. Other triggers are perfectionism as a response to trauma, having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood, being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss. The article suggests that an affair can sometimes be a subconscious attempt to break free from these deeply ingrained patterns or painful situations.</p>

Protesters gathered peacefully, chanting and holding signs denouncing what they called a "fascist takeover" and "military occupation" of the heavily Democratic city. The demonstration followed President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency," a move critics argue is a pretext for imposing federal will on local governance.

          <p>Despite ongoing summer heat, parts of the United Kingdom are showing signs of an early or "false autumn," with trees shedding leaves and autumn fruits like blackberries ripening prematurely. Experts attribute this phenomenon to the stress placed on nature by a prolonged hot and dry summer, which is on track to be one of the warmest on record. This stress forces trees into survival mode, causing them to drop leaves and branches to conserve water. Conservation groups warn that this disruption to natural cycles could have negative impacts on wildlife that depend on seasonal resources for food through the autumn and winter.</p>

          <h2>Family Feud Leaves British Tycoon's Body in Kenyan Mortuary for 11 Years</h2>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has remained in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter and protracted legal battle between his family members. Following his death in 2013, his two sons from his first marriage accused his second wife and their two daughters of poisoning him to inherit his estate, a claim they denied. The dispute led to the exhumation of his body, but its advanced decomposition made determining a cause of death impossible. A magistrate has now concluded the inquest, but with the family still divided on whether to bury him in the UK or Kenya, his final resting place remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, who are about to receive their GCSE results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds in March 2021. The letters were written just as they returned to school after a major COVID-19 lockdown, capturing their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The exercise was designed by their teacher to instill self-belief during a uniquely disruptive period that shaped their entire secondary school education. Four years later, the students reflected on their younger selves' questions about girlfriends, dreams of attending university, and hopes for a post-pandemic world.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning the plight of children affected by the war in Ukraine. The letter, described as deeply personal, speaks to the innocence of children and implores Putin to "restore their melodic laughter." While the text does not explicitly mention the abduction of Ukrainian children, for which Putin faces an indictment from the International Criminal Court, Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to the issue. The gesture comes as U.S. lawmakers demand the return of abducted children as a condition for any peace deal.</p>

          <p>The Chilean government plans to expropriate a portion of Villa Baviera, formerly known as Colonia Dignidad, to create a memorial for the victims of the Pinochet dictatorship. The site was home to a secretive German religious sect led by Paul Schäfer, where residents were abused and forced into labor, and where political prisoners were tortured and killed. The plan has divided the remaining residents of the community, which has since become a tourist destination. While victims' families support creating a place of remembrance, some current residents, who also identify as victims of Schäfer's regime, fear the expropriation will displace them and disrupt their rebuilt lives.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing international diners to a wide diversity of regional cuisines far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition in their home market, brands specializing in fiery Hunanese dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for further global expansion. These restaurants aim to correct outdated stereotypes about Chinese food by offering authentic, sophisticated dining experiences, sometimes in immersive settings. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a potent form of cultural diplomacy for China, softening its global image.</p>
