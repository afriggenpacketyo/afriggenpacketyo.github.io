          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner in New York City's mayoral race, is encountering significant opposition from the city's billionaire class and powerful real estate interests. His progressive platform, which includes a rent freeze and a modest tax increase on the wealthiest New Yorkers, has prompted wealthy donors to spend millions in an attempt to block his campaign. Despite these efforts, polls show Mamdani maintaining a strong lead, suggesting that financial influence may be failing to sway voters who support his agenda.</p>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised job growth figures downward, and individuals with advanced degrees report sending hundreds of applications with minimal response, often being forced into underemployment. This difficult market is attributed to factors like keyword-filtering hiring software, increased automation, and economic uncertainty, creating a stark gap between government data and lived experience.</p>

          <p>An immigration attorney describes being personally targeted with a motion for sanctions by the Department of Justice after successfully fighting to prevent a client's sudden removal to Laos. The lawyer, who took the case pro bono, argues this is part of a novel strategy by the Trump administration to intimidate and disable attorneys who challenge its aggressive immigration policies. This personal account highlights the erosion of due process and the increasing pressure on legal professionals working to uphold the law for vulnerable clients.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that kindergartners have the highest rates of chronic absenteeism in California, a problem that can significantly impact long-term literacy and educational development. Focus groups with parents in Los Angeles Unified School District found that illness is a primary reason for absences, and many parents are unaware of what constitutes "chronic absence" or its consequences. While rates have fallen from their pandemic peak, they remain high, prompting calls for better communication and support for families to ensure children attend school consistently.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has shifted its use of MQ-9 Predator drones from border patrol and war zones to monitoring domestic protests, as seen during recent anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles. This deployment marks a significant policy change and has alarmed civil liberties advocates, who fear the military-grade surveillance technology infringes on First Amendment rights. The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and video capabilities, can track numerous individuals from high altitudes, prompting legislative efforts to restrict their use over civilian demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The massive federal cleanup of the Eaton and Palisades fire debris has been completed in a record eight months, but experts and residents worry that speed may have compromised safety. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cleared nearly 9,700 properties without conducting soil testing for toxic metals, a departure from previous California wildfire responses. Subsequent independent testing has found elevated levels of lead at some cleared sites, raising concerns that the burden of ensuring safety has now been shifted to homeowners eager to rebuild.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is actively trying to recruit experienced local police officers with offers of high salaries and bonuses to expand its deportation force. However, the agency is facing challenges in states like California, where local law enforcement salaries are often already competitive or higher than what ICE can offer. This dynamic highlights the nationwide struggle for law enforcement recruitment and has created tension between federal and local agencies competing for a limited pool of qualified officers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are refusing to release a taxpayer-funded report on the seismic safety of the Gas Co. Tower, a downtown skyscraper recently purchased to be the new county headquarters. This lack of transparency raises concerns about whether the 52-story building, constructed with a steel-moment frame, could sustain significant damage in a major earthquake, potentially rendering it unusable. The decision to withhold the report comes as county supervisors have suspended work on a potential $230 million seismic retrofit, citing financial constraints.</p>

The small, implanted device delivers daily electrical pulses to the nerve, which helps regulate the body's inflammatory response and reduce joint pain and swelling. In clinical trials, the treatment, developed by SetPoint Medical, showed meaningful improvement for a significant percentage of patients with difficult-to-treat cases of the autoimmune disease.</p>

          <p>Tangier Island, a historic crabbing community in the Chesapeake Bay, is at risk of being submerged within the next 50 years due to climate change. The island has already lost two-thirds of its landmass since 1850 from a combination of rising sea levels, more intense storms, and regional land subsidence. Despite the dire predictions and a dwindling population, residents are fighting to save their unique culture and way of life, though the estimated cost of protection measures is hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
