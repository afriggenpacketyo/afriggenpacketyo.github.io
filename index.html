        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate surged to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level since January 2023, driven by rising rice prices and other factors. The Bank of Japan is closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs while considering potential rate hikes. Rice prices have doubled over the past year, prompting the Prime Minister to pledge to lower them. Economists anticipate a potential easing of core inflation in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. The Japanese yen strengthened slightly against the U.S. dollar following the inflation data release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has announced new sanctions on Sudan after determining that the country's military used chemical weapons in its ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). These sanctions include restrictions on U.S. exports to Sudan and financial borrowing limits. The conflict, which began two years ago, has resulted in over 150,000 deaths, with both sides accused of war crimes. The U.S. specifically cited the use of chlorine gas, which causes painful and damaging effects, as a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass’ public safety initiatives to prevent the layoff of 1,000 city workers. The budget reduces funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than since 1995, and scales back new hires for the Fire Department. Council members expressed concerns over cost-cutting efforts at public safety agencies, while others defended the budget for promoting equity and inclusivity. The council aims to find additional savings to potentially increase funding for LAPD recruitment later in the year.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration revoked the university's permission to enroll them. This action could affect the degrees and futures of thousands of students, as well as the university's identity and culture. Students expressed fear and confusion, with some considering transferring to other universities. The university has been facing rapid-fire aggressions since its president refused to change its hiring and admissions practices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is using an obscure bureaucratic lever to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. By revoking Harvard's certification to use the SEVIS database, the government is effectively barring the university from managing and tracking its international student enrollment. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to align with the president's agenda. The move could leave thousands of foreign students in limbo, potentially facing deportation unless they transfer to another school or a court intervenes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires the government to provide basic rights and protections to child immigrants in its custody. The protections limit the amount of time children can be detained and require adequate food, water, and clean clothes. The justice department argued that the agreement has incentivized unauthorized border crossings and prevented the government from effectively detaining and removing families. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the move, stating that it is unconscionable to eviscerate protections for children.</p>
