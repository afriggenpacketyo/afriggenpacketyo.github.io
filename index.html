        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation restricting travel to the U.S. from twelve countries, citing national security concerns and inadequate vetting processes. The ban affects nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The White House emphasized the need to protect Americans from potential security threats, pointing to issues such as insufficient information sharing and high visa overstay rates. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban from Trump's first term, which was later ended by President Biden, and is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Shein and Temu have seen a significant decrease in U.S. user engagement after President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' loophole.

This decline coincides with a reduction in advertising spending by Shein and Temu in the U.S. market since the tariff announcements. The tariffs included the end of the 'de minimis' exemption, which previously allowed companies to ship low-cost goods under $800 to the U.S. tariff-free. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying military resources, including Stryker combat vehicles, to the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to deter illegal immigration. This deployment, involving thousands of soldiers, spy planes, and Navy ships, aims to combat what Trump has described as an 'invasion'. The military is establishing National Defense Areas along the border, allowing soldiers to detain migrants as trespassers until Border Patrol agents arrive. Critics argue this militarization blurs the lines between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement, while the administration asserts it is necessary for national security.</p>

The proclamation orders the State Department to review whether current foreign students should have their visas revoked. The move, effective immediately, is expected to further strain relations between the U.S. and China. Harvard has responded, calling the action an illegal retaliatory step.</p>
