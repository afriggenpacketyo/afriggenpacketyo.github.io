        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming third round of trade talks between the United States and China will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, highlighting a strategic shift towards neutral European venues. This move, following meetings in Geneva and London, suggests a desire for a more level playing field compared to previous negotiations held in the respective countries. Swedish officials view their selection as a host as a sign of international trust and recognition of their role in fostering global dialogue. The choice of neutral territory marks a significant change from the bilateral dialogues that characterized negotiations during the first Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Country music star Carrie Underwood is fully embracing a traditional country lifestyle on her family farm near Nashville, Tennessee. Alongside her husband and two sons, she engages in homesteading practices, including growing her own produce, raising livestock, and learning skills like canning and crocheting. Underwood has shared her experiences on social media, from encounters with snakes in her orchard to the satisfaction of preparing meals with home-grown ingredients. Her ultimate goal is to become self-sufficient and no longer rely on store-bought food for her family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a large-scale music festival, named Monmouth Rising, was an elaborate fabrication created by a convicted fraudster named James Kenny. The event promised a lineup including major bands like The Killers and was promoted as the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, supposedly bringing millions into the local Welsh economy. However, Kenny never paid deposits for bands, secured licenses, or had the claimed investors, leaving employees and suppliers unpaid. The entire operation, which fooled industry insiders, was run from his mother's kitchen table and ultimately collapsed without a single ticket holder losing money due to payment protections.</p>

          <p>A man and a woman were discovered deceased on a walking trail in Arkansas's Devil's Den State Park, prompting a double homicide investigation by state police. Authorities are actively searching for a suspect, described as a white male in dark clothing and weight-lifting gloves, who was seen driving a black four-door sedan from the park. The vehicle, possibly a Mazda, may have had its license plate obscured with tape.

          <p>The UK government is considering reforms to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints. The proposed changes would require developers building new properties near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing measures. These reforms aim to reverse the decline in the pub industry, make it easier to open new establishments in disused shops, and promote outdoor dining. While Labour supports the move to reduce red tape, the Conservatives argue that tax policies have been the primary cause of the hospitality industry's struggles.</p>

However, economists express concerns about the feasibility of the project, highlighting the need for substantial funding, estimated at around $4 billion, and the challenge of securing private sector buy-in.

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by joking about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her performances have resonated widely, but have also drawn a warning from at least one local government, which cautioned that such jokes provoke gender conflict. Fan's background, differing from typical urban elite feminists, may contribute to official unease, suggesting discontent with traditional values is more widespread than acknowledged. Despite the scrutiny, Fan says comedy has been a form of catharsis, helping her find reconciliation with her past experiences.</p>

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The suspects are accused of keeping some of the children, aged 7 to 16, in plywood cages built under bunk beds. The victims were allegedly beaten with canes, sprayed in the face with vinegar as punishment, and given non-prescribed medication. An investigation began after a church member raised concerns, revealing that the adopted children in the home were treated unfairly compared to the biological children and were instructed to lie about the abuse.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a more assertive presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, raising historical sensitivities with South Korea. The party chief, Huang Qiang, urged scholars to clearly explain the history of the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as part of China's narrative. These kingdoms are known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae and are considered central to Korean history. This contested view of history has long been a point of contention, and the official's remarks risk reigniting diplomatic friction between Beijing and Seoul.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government appears to be increasingly censoring news about mass attacks, such as incidents where drivers strike pedestrians, leading to public pushback online. Following a particularly deadly attack in November, authorities have tightened information control, often releasing minimal details or scrubbing reports and images from the internet. In several recent cases, this censorship has prompted citizens to complain on social media, demanding transparency and the release of basic facts. Experts suggest the government may be trying to prevent copycat crimes, while local officials might be covering up failures, creating tension between public information and state control.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to permanently divide the war-torn country. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and stokes fears of escalating the 27-month civil war. This development follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular state. The UN has warned that this action risks further fragmenting Sudan and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has personally intervened in the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, announcing that he called both nations' leaders to press for an immediate ceasefire. Both countries acknowledged the calls and thanked Trump for his concern, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire request. However, Thailand reiterated its position that a dialogue must precede a formal truce, and shelling reportedly continued along the border after the calls. Trump's intervention comes a week before significant US tariffs on both countries are set to take effect, linking the conflict resolution to future trade talks.</p>
