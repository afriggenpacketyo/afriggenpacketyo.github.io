          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of 2025, has caused a barrier lake to burst in eastern Taiwan, resulting in at least two deaths and trapping hundreds. The storm, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, brought heavy rainfall and flooding before moving towards China's Guangdong province. In response, Chinese authorities have evacuated approximately 370,000 people, and Hong Kong has issued its maximum-level typhoon warning, leading to widespread flight cancellations and preparations for significant storm surges. The event highlights the increasing intensity of tropical storms, a trend that scientists link to climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned meeting with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, citing their "unserious and ridiculous demands" regarding government funding. With an October 1 shutdown deadline looming, both parties have failed to agree on a short-term funding extension, clashing over issues like healthcare tax credits and spending priorities. Trump stated he would only meet when Democrats "become realistic," while Democratic leaders accused him of throwing a "tantrum" and running from negotiations, asserting that he will be responsible for any resulting government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has convicted Ryan Routh on all five charges related to the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself at trial, was arrested at Trump's golf course after a Secret Service agent spotted him with a rifle. The agent testified that he opened fire after Routh aimed the weapon at him, causing Routh to flee without discharging his own weapon. This incident was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, following a separate shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>Health officials worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are strongly rejecting President Trump's recent assertions that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. Regulators from the U.S., Europe, and Australia have reaffirmed that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting this claim and that the medication remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. These organizations also pushed back against the president's related suggestions that vaccines cause autism, emphasizing that such claims are scientifically unfounded and dangerous to public health.</p>

          <p>The practice of selling verification checkmarks on social media platforms is eroding their original purpose as markers of authenticity, making it easier for scammers to appear legitimate. Fraudsters can now purchase credibility, creating fake accounts that exploit user trust to spread phishing links, steal personal information, and commit identity theft. To stay safe, users are advised to scrutinize profiles for signs of inauthenticity, avoid clicking suspicious links, use strong antivirus software, and enable robust login protections like password managers.

          <p>OpenAI and Nvidia have announced a landmark $100 billion partnership, solidifying their collaboration to build the next generation of AI supercomputing facilities. The deal involves Nvidia investing in OpenAI through successive $10 billion tranches and supplying advanced processors for new data centers. Negotiated directly by CEOs Sam Altman and Jensen Huang, the agreement positions the two companies at the center of the AI boom, deepening their interdependence. This major infrastructure push, part of OpenAI's "Stargate" initiative, will proceed even as OpenAI navigates complex relationships with other key partners like Microsoft and Oracle.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officially approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, commonly known as "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. Rather than fully replacing human umpires, the system will function as a challenge mechanism, allowing each team two appeals per game for ball and strike calls. If a challenge is successful, the team retains it, with reviews displayed on stadium videoboards for transparency. The technology, which has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019, aims to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to disputed calls.</p>

          <p>A little-known provision called the "Medigap birthday rule," available in about 18 states, offers a valuable opportunity for Medicare beneficiaries to change their supplemental insurance plans. This rule provides a specific window around a person's birthday each year during which they can switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits without undergoing medical underwriting, meaning they cannot be denied or charged more for pre-existing conditions. This allows seniors who might otherwise be locked into an expensive plan to find more affordable coverage. The specifics of the rule, such as the duration of the enrollment window, vary by state.</p>

          <p>With recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a $60,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. At the current average rate of 8.05%, the monthly payment would be approximately $730 for a 10-year repayment period or $575 for a 15-year period. A key advantage of a HELOC is its variable rate, which could lead to even lower payments if the Fed continues to cut rates as anticipated later this year. This flexibility, combined with the ability to draw only what is needed, makes it a potentially attractive financial tool. (not investment advice)</p>

His comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the Trump administration to exert more control over the Fed, including public demands for specific interest rate cuts and attempts to reshape its board of governors.

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from carbapenem-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics and require expensive, intravenous treatments. Researchers suggest the rise may be linked to increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic and warn that the bacteria could spread in the community, making common infections like UTIs much harder to treat.

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential long-term consequences of the Trump administration's campaign against media outlets, highlighted by the recent pressure on ABC and its affiliates regarding Jimmy Kimmel. Some prominent conservatives, like Senator Ted Cruz and Ben Shapiro, are warning that using governmental power to silence critical speech sets a dangerous precedent that could be used against them by a future Democratic administration. The author argues that defending free speech should be based on principle, not partisan advantage, cautioning that justifying such actions as retaliation only erodes fundamental protections for everyone. The piece suggests that two wrongs don't make a right.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a breakthrough in AI chip-cooling technology, developing an in-chip microfluidics system that brings liquid coolant directly inside the silicon, making it three times more effective than current methods. The news caused a temporary dip in the stocks of data center power and cooling companies like GE Vernova and Eaton. In other business news, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly announced it is investing $6.5 billion to build a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The plant will focus on producing small molecule medicines, including its oral GLP-1 obesity drug, orforglipron, to meet anticipated high demand.</p>

          <p>Luther "Luke" Campbell, frontman of the controversial 1980s rap group 2 Live Crew, advises Jimmy Kimmel to fight against the censorship efforts from the Trump administration. Campbell draws parallels to his own successful legal battles against obscenity charges in Florida, where he fought to protect free speech and resist the demonization of his music. He argues that if Kimmel and his network back down in the face of government pressure, it will set a dangerous precedent that will be used against other entertainers and media figures. Campbell frames the situation as a critical fight to protect the First Amendment for everyone.</p>

          <p>In response to confusing and inconsistent federal vaccine recommendations, states are forming regional public health alliances to create unified guidance for their residents. Blocs like the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative are coordinating on recommendations for COVID, flu, and RSV vaccines, as well as data sharing and lab testing. State health officials say they are filling a vacuum left by Washington and attempting to restore public trust in science. This fragmentation of public health authority risks creating a patchwork of policies across the country, with some states expanding protections while others roll them back.</p>

          <p>A 2011 email has surfaced showing Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, apologizing to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and calling him a "supreme friend," shortly after she had publicly disowned him. Her former spokesperson claims the email was sent under duress following a "chilling" and "menacing" phone call in which Epstein threatened to "destroy" her and her family. The threats were allegedly a reaction to an interview where Ferguson called accepting money from him a "terrible error of judgment" and stated she abhorred pedophilia. The revelation has led several charities to sever ties with the Duchess.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has awarded $9.6 million to a California man who suffered two strokes during an American Airlines flight from Miami to Madrid in 2021. The lawsuit claimed that the flight crew failed to follow protocol when the passenger, Jesus Plasencia, had an initial "mini stroke" at the gate, dismissing his wife's concerns and clearing the plane for takeoff. After suffering a more severe stroke mid-flight, the crew allegedly did not divert the plane, delaying critical medical care for nearly eight hours. The jury found the airline liable under the Montreal Convention, which governs international air travel.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has ordered actor Noel Clarke to pay a minimum of £3 million towards the legal costs of Guardian News and Media after he lost his libel lawsuit against the publisher. Clarke sued The Guardian over a series of 2021 articles that reported on allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment from multiple women. In August, a judge dismissed his claim, finding the newspaper's reporting was substantially true and in the public interest. Clarke, who represented himself at the costs hearing, stated that the legal battle had financially ruined him, but the judge ruled the payment was appropriate given he pursued a "false case."</p>

The decision comes after the team's 0-3 start to the season, which culminated in fans chanting for the rookie during a Sunday night loss to Kansas City. Wilson has struggled, throwing three touchdowns against three interceptions through three games. Dart, who has taken a few snaps in previous games but has not yet attempted a pass, will now make his first career NFL start as the team seeks to turn its season around.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell characterized the current U.S. economic landscape as a "challenging situation," citing the dual pressures of a recent inflation uptick and a slowdown in hiring. In a speech, he noted that the downside risks to employment have increased, which was a key factor in the Fed's decision to cut interest rates last week. However, he also expressed continued concern about the path of inflation, highlighting the difficult balancing act the central bank faces. The Fed's policy aims to support the labor market without allowing prices to escalate further, navigating what Powell called a "turbulent period." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a new $100,000 fee on all new applications for H-1B high-skill work visas, a move intended to curb alleged abuse of the program by outsourcing firms. However, this article argues the policy is a flawed solution that will ultimately harm the U.S. economy. While the high fee may deter companies hiring for lower-wage tech jobs, it will also severely impact universities and non-profit research institutions that rely on foreign talent but cannot afford such costs. This could stifle scientific research, reduce innovation, and ultimately lead to lower long-term growth and wages for American workers.</p>

Officials warned that such a network could also be weaponized to overwhelm and shut down cellular networks, comparing the potential impact to communication failures during major crises.

His complaints were bolstered by a malfunctioning teleprompter and escalator he encountered at the building, which he used as further evidence of the UN's incompetence.</p>
