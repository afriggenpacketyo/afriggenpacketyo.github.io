He cautioned that the bank must stay prepared for new economic shocks and potential future deviations from its 2% target. While the primary objective is considered achieved, other officials noted that risks to growth and inflation are now tilted downwards, suggesting any future rate adjustments would likely be cuts.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant single-month drop since February 2023. This decline may reflect weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds that came into effect in April. Despite the monthly fall, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, though this is the slowest rate in nearly a year.

          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" as Republicans push to pass the legislation before a July 4 deadline. The bill, which combines spending increases for defense and border security with cuts to healthcare, is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit. Democrats used the session to force votes on controversial amendments, while Republican leaders worked to secure support from party holdouts to ensure the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>A new Iowa law has taken effect, removing gender identity from the state's civil rights code and thus eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary residents in areas like housing and employment. The legislation also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to birth certificates, a move Governor Kim Reynolds said clarifies biological differences. This makes Iowa the first state to roll back such protections, leaving affected individuals vulnerable and prompting fears of increased hostility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen an estimated $6.8 billion in federal education funds that were already appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year. The move impacts programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, and aid for English learners and migrant students, with California set to lose over $800 million. State education leaders have condemned the action as illegal, warning it will immediately harm students and disrupt programs for which staff have already been hired in anticipation of the funds.</p>
