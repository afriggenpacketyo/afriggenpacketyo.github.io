          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 06:47:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump claimed Los Angeles was under siege due to protests over immigration enforcement, prompting a response from Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, who denied the city was out of control. Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, a move Newsom has condemned as an illegal overreach of federal power and is suing over, while Bass insisted the city's police force could manage the situation. The protests were triggered by ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Despite the unrest, much of the city operated normally, and the annual Pride Parade proceeded without incident, and authorities are working to maintain order.</p>

Decker's truck was found at the campsite with bloody handprints, and his dog was found alive nearby. The search area has expanded, and residents are urged to secure their homes as Decker is considered an outdoorsman with survival skills, and the cause of death for the girls has been determined to be suffocation. </p>

          <p>Fifteen police officers were injured in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault.

The protest and subsequent violence followed the court appearance of two teenage boys accused of the sexual assault of a teenage girl. The violence included masked individuals throwing masonry at officers and damaging police vehicles, and the local MP noted the context of demographic change due to immigration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration activated approximately 700 Marines to assist in Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to threaten legal action. Newsom argued that the deployment was illegal and an abuse of power, while the military stated the Marines would integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of the deployment, emphasizing the agency's experience in managing large-scale demonstrations. Newsom's office initially stated that the Marines were simply being moved between bases, but the situation remains tense as the state challenges the federal government's authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend shows that Gen Z is increasingly finding religion, reversing previous declines in religious attendance. Experts suggest this may be a form of rebellion against atheist parents or a search for meaning in a chaotic world. Some note a rise in young men joining Catholicism, possibly due to the perceived privileged position of men in the church hierarchy. This shift indicates a potential change in the cultural landscape of religion in America, as young people seek answers and community in religious institutions.</p>

The book, titled *Rory Land: The Up-and-Down World of Golf’s Global Icon*, explores McIlroy's career, family, and Northern Irish heritage, and Gay also addressed the recent driver controversy involving McIlroy at the PGA Championship.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been aggressively using Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to block the entry of noncitizens into the United States. This law allows the president to ban foreigners whose entry is deemed detrimental to U.S. interests, and Trump has invoked it for travel bans, health care requirements, and restrictions on foreign students. While some of these actions have faced legal challenges, the Supreme Court has affirmed the president's broad powers under this law. Previous presidents used this authority sparingly, but Trump has expanded its use to implement his restrictive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>There is increasing discussion about recession indicators on social media platforms like TikTok and X, with users humorously pointing to signs such as bars skimping on snacks. Historically, indicators like women's skirt lengths, men's underwear sales, cardboard box sales, and frozen pizza purchases have been used to gauge economic conditions. Some economists believe that public sentiment and emotions, or "animal spirits," can influence economic booms and busts. While serious economists may not rely on these informal indicators, the widespread discussion itself could be a sign of underlying economic anxiety. (not investment advice)</p>

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the incident as "horrific" and unacceptable, stating that Tomasi was clearly identified as a reporter. Tomasi confirmed she was safe and the demonstrations in Los Angeles began with a few hundred people on Friday and swelled by Sunday to thousands who blocked a major freeway and set several self-driving cars on fire.</p>

Protests have spread to other U.S. cities, and Los Angeles police officers have used stun grenades and gas canisters to disperse demonstrators.

          <p>Venezuelans are experiencing confusion and fear following the Trump administration's travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Venezuela. Many travelers with valid visas rushed to reach the U.S. before the ban took effect, causing flights to sell out and prices to surge. The ban has shattered long-held routines and created anxiety among the Venezuelan diaspora, who feel stigmatized by the decision. The U.S. justified the ban on the grounds that the Venezuelan government has refused to accept deported nationals, and opposition politicians have urged the U.S. government to revise the travel restrictions.</p>
