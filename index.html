          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is reportedly involved in high-level discussions, with backing from the White House, to potentially lead a post-war transitional authority in Gaza. The proposal would see Blair head a UN and Gulf-backed governing body before handing control back to Palestinians. Blair, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, has stated he would not support any plan that displaces Gazans. This development comes as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has expressed readiness to work on a two-state solution and rejected any future governing role for Hamas.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization has successfully ratified a significant agreement to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies, marking a rare multilateral achievement after 25 years of negotiations. This deal is seen as a vital sign of life for the WTO, which has struggled to produce major agreements in its three-decade history. The development, coupled with China's recent commitment to no longer exploit "developing country" status for trade protections, provides a boost for advocates of multilateralism. It represents a major step forward in global trade cooperation and environmental sustainability.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated he will move 2026 World Cup matches away from any host cities he considers to be unsafe, specifically mentioning Democratic-run cities like Seattle and San Francisco. While FIFA is responsible for organizing the tournament, Trump's close relationship with its president and his role as chair of the World Cup taskforce lend weight to his threat. It remains unclear if he has the authority to make such changes, which would present significant logistical challenges. The statement aligns with Trump's broader political agenda of focusing on crime in urban areas.</p>

          <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has removed some of its staff from the investigation into police contact with the Nottingham attacks killer, Valdo Calocane. The removal follows allegations that investigators improperly shared details with the officers under investigation, suggesting they would receive lenient sanctions and that the case was being driven by the victims' families. Emma Webber, mother of victim Barnaby Webber, expressed "pure horror" at the claims, which she said are indicative of institutional failures. The IOPC has commissioned an independent external review into the serious allegations.</p>

          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com is launching a share buyback initiative for its employees, based on a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its peak valuation of $40 billion during a 2022 funding round, reflecting broader trends in the tech sector. The company, which competes with payment processors like Stripe and Adyen, says it is on track for over 30% revenue growth this year. The move provides liquidity for employees as many tech firms are delaying initial public offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new set of industry-focused tariffs, including a 100% levy on imported branded pharmaceuticals unless the manufacturer is building a factory in the U.S. The measures also include a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks and a 50% tax on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, which Trump stated are necessary to protect American manufacturers from being "flooded" by foreign products. The move has raised concerns among U.S. businesses and international partners about potential economic disruption and increased costs for consumers.

          <p>Cities across the world, including in the UK and North America, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon some are calling "Ratmageddon." Experts suggest that factors like rising global temperatures, which lead to warmer winters and longer breeding seasons, are contributing to the surge. Human factors, such as increased fast-food waste and less frequent rubbish collection, also provide ample food sources for the rodents. A recent study found a direct correlation between temperature increases and rising rat activity in 11 of 16 cities examined, highlighting a growing public health challenge.</p>

A fast start in the opening foursomes sessions, which the home team has dominated in recent years, is seen as crucial for setting the tone. Other critical elements include managing the famously boisterous New York crowd, the experience gap favoring Europe, and the potential influence of President Trump's attendance.</p>

China utilizes a comprehensive five-year plan system, managed by its National Development and Reform Commission, to set proactive goals for growth and industrial policy. In contrast, the U.S. relies on the "invisible hand" of the market, with fiscal and monetary policy tools that have become less effective due to intense political polarization.

          <p>British energy giant BP, which was seen as a prime takeover target just months ago, is now in a much stronger position, causing acquisition speculation to fade. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since April, outperforming many rivals due to a strategic reset, a new leadership team, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, rivals like Shell and Exxon Mobil were rumored as potential suitors, but BP's improved performance and rising valuation have made a takeover less likely. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth to drive shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger, a recent defector to Reform UK from the Conservative Party, has defended his new party's hardline immigration policies. Responding to concerns that scrapping indefinite leave to remain could lead to the deportation of long-term residents, Kruger denied any plan for a "pensioner deportation programme," stating such residents should apply for citizenship. He also asserted that immigration from Muslim countries poses a threat to UK culture due to a perceived lack of integration. Kruger argued that politicians should be allowed to use terms like "invasion" to describe migration.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the viral Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased to see a decline in the toy's inflated resale prices. At their peak, some editions were being sold for over 2,000% of their retail price, but the secondary market is now cooling as the company has significantly ramped up production to meet demand. Pop Mart claims its goal is to make its art accessible to genuine fans, not to fuel a speculative market that alienates real customers. Analysts see this as a strategic pivot towards a more sustainable, long-term business model.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Trump administration health official, has clarified the government's recent announcement regarding a potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) and autism. He stated that pregnant women should "of course" take the medication if a doctor recommends it, especially to treat a high fever, which can pose its own risks. However, he cautioned against casual, unadvised use for minor aches and pains during pregnancy. The clarification follows pushback from medical groups who criticized the initial announcement for lacking causal evidence and potentially causing undue alarm.</p>

Zelenskyy's original five-year term would have ended in May 2024, but it has been extended due to the ongoing full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022.</p>
