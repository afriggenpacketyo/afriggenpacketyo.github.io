The storm, the thirteenth of the Atlantic season, is moving slowly but is expected to intensify into a major hurricane, potentially packing winds of 140 mph. Authorities have issued hurricane warnings for Jamaica and watches for parts of Haiti and Cuba, with some areas bracing for catastrophic rainfall of up to three feet. The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay has begun evacuating non-essential personnel in preparation for the storm's arrival.</p>

          <p>Former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik has denied any wrongdoing in the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who died from a possible drug overdose. Kramnik had publicly accused Naroditsky of cheating in online games, which Naroditsky's friends and colleagues say took a severe toll on his mental health. In a statement, Kramnik called the death a tragedy but described the backlash against him as a cynical harassment campaign, asserting that his lawyers are preparing lawsuits. The International Chess Federation (Fide) has referred Kramnik's public statements to its Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review.</p>

          <p>A daring daylight robbery at the Louvre, where thieves stole jewels valued at over $100 million, has unexpectedly become a viral internet phenomenon. While French authorities continue their investigation, the heist has captured the public's imagination, leading to a wave of memes, Halloween costumes, and cheeky advertisements from brands like IKEA. The crime's cinematic quality has drawn comparisons to the "Ocean's" film franchise, with even actor George Clooney joking about the thieves' success. This cultural response has turned a serious criminal act into a source of widespread online entertainment and fascination.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency, stating, "I am not done." While promoting her new book, Harris reflected on her 2024 campaign loss to Donald Trump, whose presidency she described as authoritarian. She did not commit to a 2028 run but left the possibility open, saying she still sees a future for herself in public service. However, a recent poll in her home state of California showed that fewer than a third of voters endorsed her for another presidential attempt.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a difficult start to the Ashes series, losing 26-6 to Australia at Wembley in a performance their coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, while Australia, led by player of the match Reece Walsh, capitalized on their opponents' errors to secure a comfortable victory. The defeat puts Australia in a strong position to retain the Ashes in the next match. England's coach Shaun Wane expressed deep disappointment, emphasizing that the team failed to showcase its true capabilities and must make immediate improvements.</p>

          <p>The popular investment strategy of passively buying S&P 500 index funds, known as "VOO and chill," may be losing its appeal due to a lack of diversification. Financial experts note that with the technology sector now comprising a record 35% of the index, investors are increasingly looking elsewhere for broader market exposure. This has led to renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently hitting an all-time high.

          <p>Law enforcement officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California, during a protest against a planned immigration crackdown. The incident occurred when the driver of the truck began reversing erratically toward a line of security personnel, who opened fire after the driver failed to comply with verbal commands to stop. The driver was wounded and is now in custody, with the FBI leading the investigation. The protest was part of a day of demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement plans in the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>The recent demolition of the White House East Wing to build a new ballroom was the subject of a panel discussion on "Washington Week With The Atlantic." Panelists expressed shock at the rapid destruction of the historic structure, which has housed the Office of the First Lady and holds significant cultural memory. The act was interpreted as a sign of President Trump's disregard for presidential norms and tradition, with one writer stating it was a way for him to "thumb his nose at the idea that checks and balances actually work."</p>

          <p>Following the demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist from The Atlantic chronicled her attempt to track down the historic rubble. The search led her to East Potomac Golf Links, where dirt from the site was reportedly being used to create a new golf hole, and then to an industrial dump in Maryland, where workers were instructed not to speak to the press. The article reflects on the quiet disposal of a cherished national landmark, highlighting the contrast between its public significance and its unceremonious end as construction debris.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a decision that trade experts warn could lead to higher prices for American consumers. The move was reportedly in response to a Canadian television ad critical of U.S. tariffs. A prolonged halt in talks could keep existing 35% tariffs on many goods, as well as specific levies on steel and aluminum, in place, potentially increasing the cost of items like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. This creates further uncertainty in the trade relationship ahead of a scheduled review of the USMCA agreement. (not investment advice)</p>
