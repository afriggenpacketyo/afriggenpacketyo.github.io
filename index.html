          <p>The United States is set to remove Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a key Syrian Islamist group, from its official list of foreign terrorist organizations. This decision follows the group's successful offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, with its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, now serving as Syria's interim president. HTS, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, severed ties with the terrorist network in 2016, a move central to this re-evaluation. The delisting is part of a broader Western effort to reset relations and support Syria's path toward stability, though concerns remain about the new government's radical past and recent violence against minority groups.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, have been located. The blast occurred at the warehouse of Devastating Pyrotechnics, which was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, whose own home was destroyed in the incident. Federal and state agencies are investigating the cause of the explosions, which also ignited multiple grass fires, while families of the victims await formal identification of the remains.</p>

          <h2>Poland's Reinstatement of Border Checks Sparks Fears for Europe's Schengen Area</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:38:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland has reintroduced temporary border checks with Germany and Lithuania, a move analysts fear signals a growing threat to the European Union's Schengen borderless travel zone. While Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk cited the need to curb human trafficking, the action is seen as part of a trend where member states prioritize national security over European solidarity. Experts argue these controls are often political symbolism with little real effect on migration, yet they impose significant economic costs by disrupting supply chains and cross-border commerce. The continued extension of such 'temporary' measures by countries like France and Austria raises concerns about the permanent erosion of one of the EU's most tangible achievements.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 90 deaths, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, reaching the height of a two-story building and devastating communities, most notably in Kerr County. Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and counselors were among the deceased. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area, and a massive search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies is underway to locate the unaccounted for individuals.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas were caused by an extreme weather event that saw some areas receive over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge, fueled by remnant moisture from a tropical storm, caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The region's geography, characterized by dry, packed soil, is naturally prone to rapid runoff, which exacerbated the flooding. With more rain forecasted for the already saturated region, flood watches remain in effect as communities grapple with the aftermath of the disaster.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article focusing on how New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani identified his race on a college application has drawn significant criticism for its perceived lack of newsworthiness and potential political motivation. The story, which detailed Mamdani checking both 'Asian' and 'African American' boxes to reflect his Indian-Ugandan heritage, was amplified by political rivals and right-wing media. Critics, including prominent journalists, have questioned the paper's editorial judgment, especially given the information originated from a hacked database. This incident, combined with a pre-primary editorial urging voters not to rank Mamdani, has led to accusations that the Times is actively trying to undermine his candidacy.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the devastating Texas floods that have claimed over 90 lives, questions are being raised about the effectiveness and timeliness of the emergency warnings. While the National Weather Service issued several flood watches and warnings, many residents and local officials claim they were caught by surprise by the deluge's ferocity. The debate centers on whether the alerts sufficiently conveyed the catastrophic threat and why evacuations were not ordered sooner. Factors like inconsistent cell phone coverage and the high cost of a more robust, siren-based warning system are being cited as potential failures in the emergency response.</p>

The increase was most substantial among females, middle school students, and white students. In contrast, the study found that carrying a handgun in school decreased by 60% during the same period, a trend researchers suggest could be linked to increased school safety measures.

          <p>As President Donald Trump's second term continues, his approval ratings reflect a nation with divided opinions on his administration's policies, including a major domestic bill and foreign policy actions. National polls show his overall approval hovering between 40% and 45%. A state-by-state breakdown reveals significant regional disparities in public sentiment. Trump maintains strong support in states like Wyoming (69%), West Virginia (68%), and North Dakota (67%), while facing his lowest approval ratings in Vermont (26%), Hawaii (26%), and Maryland (30%). Swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan show approval at 46% and 47% respectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party, the "American Party." Trump called the move "ridiculous" and said Musk had gone "completely off the rails," suggesting that third parties only create disruption and chaos. The announcement marks a significant falling out between the two, who had previously enjoyed a close relationship. Their disagreement appears rooted in Musk's opposition to Trump's recent tax and spending bill, which ended tax credits for electric vehicles, a policy central to Musk's business interests.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge a provision in a new domestic policy bill that eliminates its funding. The lawsuit, filed in Boston, argues that the measure is unconstitutional and specifically designed to punish the organization for its role in the public debate over abortion. The complaint states that stripping Medicaid reimbursements from its nearly 600 health centers would have catastrophic consequences for the more than one million patients they serve annually. The organization is seeking to block the enforcement of the funding cut.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis, supported by multiple independent sources, highlights the growing risks associated with the spiraling U.S. national deficit. With the deficit exceeding 6% of GDP, experts warn of severe consequences, including market instability, sustained high interest rates, and inflation that could crowd out private investment. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio see classic signs of a late-stage debt cycle, while national security experts worry that rising interest payments could squeeze defense spending. The report suggests the U.S. has less than 20 years to correct its fiscal course before facing a potential default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film "F1: The Movie" has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the racing drama has out-grossed previous Apple-produced films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." A significant portion of its success is attributed to a strategic partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total global ticket sales. While the film's high production and marketing costs mean it still has a way to go to be profitable, its box office performance marks an important milestone for Apple's growing entertainment division.</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man held by Hamas for 484 days, has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. Siegel, who was freed in a Trump-brokered deal, believes the president has the power to pressure both sides to reach an agreement, end the war, and bring the final 50 captives home. His plea comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with Trump to discuss a new ceasefire proposal. Siegel described his own harrowing experience in captivity and emphasized the urgent need to prioritize the return of all hostages.</p>

Officials also raided 38 breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating wildlife rules. The confiscated lions have been sent to a local safari park for their care and safety.</p>

The All England Club stated it has now removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system, ensuring such an error cannot happen again. Officials also confirmed they will review the possibility of introducing a video review system, similar to those used in football and at other Grand Slam tournaments.</p>
