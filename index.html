          <p>Huawei reported a significant 22.4% year-on-year revenue increase in 2024, reaching $118.2 billion. This near-record high is attributed to growth in telecommunications and consumer businesses, particularly a strong comeback in the Chinese smartphone market.  However, net profit declined due to increased investments, and the company still faces challenges in international markets due to US sanctions and limited access to key technologies.  The article's focus on Huawei's success might downplay the ongoing impact of sanctions and the complexities of its global market position.</p>
