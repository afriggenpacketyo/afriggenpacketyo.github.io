She initiated contact and now visits him in prison, viewing it as a way to connect with her deceased father, who died when she was young. Despite her family's disapproval and the psychological complexity of the situation, Glassman feels a need to understand the man who was a central part of her father's story.

Patel, who previously faced media criticism for his claims about the probe's origins, stated this discovery vindicates his earlier assertions about misconduct within the FBI. The declassification of these documents is reportedly underway in coordination with other intelligence agency heads.

          <p>This opinion article explores why the Nanking massacre remains a deeply resonant and powerful symbol in contemporary Chinese culture and national identity. The author reflects on the collective trauma associated with the event, noting how it continues to shape public memory and even influences foreign policy, particularly in relations with Japan. Recent films depicting the massacre have introduced this painful history to younger generations, reinforcing its status as a foundational national wound. The piece argues that for many Chinese people, the event is more than history; it is a moral injury that has yet to be fully acknowledged.</p>

She was detained during a green card interview, separated from her husband and two young children, including a newborn she was breastfeeding. Her case drew attention due to her husband's military service and the circumstances of her arrest, which occurred despite her efforts to legalize her status. While now released on bond with an ankle monitor, her attorney states she still faces a lengthy immigration process, highlighting the administration's stringent enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former prosecutor and prominent Fox News personality, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. Pirro, a staunch ally of President Trump, had been serving in an acting capacity since May and now officially takes on one of the country's most powerful prosecutorial roles. Her confirmation follows the failed nomination of Edward Martin, whose support collapsed over his involvement in "Stop the Steal" activism. Pirro's nomination faced comparatively little resistance from Democrats, marking another successful appointment for the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of government employees. The inquiry was prompted by a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's actions, particularly the timing of his investigations before the 2024 election, were politically motivated to harm Trump's candidacy. Smith, who resigned in January, had overseen the classified documents and 2020 election subversion cases against the former president.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's order that places restrictions on immigration enforcement raids in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that federal agents cannot detain individuals based solely on factors like their race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, as these do not constitute reasonable suspicion of being in the country illegally. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving patrols" conducted by ICE and CBP that led to widespread fear and protests. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the decision for affirming constitutional protections, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized it as judicial overreach.</p>

          <h2>Mystery of Winston Churchill's Dead Platypus Solved After 80 Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers believe they have finally solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The animal, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favor during World War II, but it perished before arrival. While wartime legend blamed the animal's death on shock from a nearby German U-boat attack, newly analyzed records suggest a more mundane cause. Logbooks from the platypus's attendant show that water and air temperatures on the ship rose well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator, indicating the platypus likely died from heat stress.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a tool to boost domestic consumer spending and drive local economic growth. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example in a rapidly expanding industry, with over 4,400 amusement facilities nationwide and significant growth forecast. According to the global theme park association IAAPA, these attractions have a substantial multiplier effect on local economies, generating further revenue in surrounding areas. This strategy reflects a broader push to encourage consumption as a key driver of China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article features a discussion with Kori Schake from the American Enterprise Institute about the potential for a conservative foreign policy that challenges the direction set by Donald Trump. The conversation explores her recent "Foreign Affairs" piece, which delves into America's changing role in a "post-American world." It examines whether a coherent and influential conservative alternative exists outside of Trump's "America First" doctrine. The discussion centers on the ideological debates within the conservative movement regarding international engagement, alliances, and the United States' global responsibilities.</p>

          <p>NPR speaks with author Carol Mason about her new book, "From the Clinics to the Capitol: How Opposing Abortion Became Insurrectionary." The discussion examines the book's central thesis, which traces the historical and ideological connections between the anti-abortion movement and broader far-right extremist politics in the United States. Mason argues that tactics and rhetoric developed in protests at abortion clinics have evolved and been adopted by other insurrectionary movements. The interview delves into how this single-issue activism became intertwined with a larger political agenda.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense to combat the online advertisement of illegal Channel crossings by people-smuggling gangs. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could result in up to five years in prison for creating and publishing material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. Home Office analysis indicates that a vast majority of migrants arriving via small boats have used social media to contact criminal agents. The government believes this new offense will provide law enforcement with more effective tools to disrupt the business model of these criminal networks.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the stories of two survivors of the "Son of Sam" shootings, Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, who were attacked in 1977 and 1976, respectively. Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz when they were both shot; he was permanently blinded, and she tragically died from her injuries. Denaro was shot in the head but survived, with police initially not connecting his case to the serial killer. Both men reflect on how the random, violent attacks irrevocably changed their lives and their relief when David Berkowitz was finally arrested.</p>

          <p>A global TikTok trend for Labubu dolls has led to a surge in dangerous counterfeit versions being sold to unsuspecting consumers. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of fake dolls, which are often poorly made and pose a serious choking hazard to children as small parts easily detach. The popularity of the authentic dolls, made by Pop Mart, has created a lucrative market for criminals who rush to produce cheap knock-offs using potentially toxic materials. Authorities warn that the fakes are part of a massive criminal enterprise and urge consumers to be wary of deals that seem too good to be true.</p>
