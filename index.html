This robust job report suggests the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts, though economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court announced it will hear appeals from West Virginia and Idaho concerning their state laws banning transgender athletes from female sports teams in public schools. This decision marks a significant civil rights challenge, with lower courts having sided with student athletes who argue the laws violate the 14th Amendment and Title IX. The outcome will address the contentious issue of "biological sex" versus gender identity in sports, a key flashpoint in the ongoing culture war.</p>
