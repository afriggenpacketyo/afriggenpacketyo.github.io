          <p>Russia has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move hailed by Kabul as courageous. The decision aims to foster bilateral cooperation in areas like energy, transport, and security, despite international condemnation of the Taliban's human rights record, particularly the severe restrictions imposed on women. This formal recognition follows years of engagement, including a 2022 economic deal, and marks a significant diplomatic shift nearly four years after the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>Hamas is currently deliberating with other Palestinian groups over a new ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by the United States. President Trump has indicated that Israel has accepted the terms for a 60-day truce, with a response from Hamas expected shortly. The proposed deal reportedly includes a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, increased humanitarian aid, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal from parts of Gaza. The outcome of these consultations remains critical for the region.</p>

          <p>A British and a New Zealander tourist were killed by an elephant during a guided walking safari in Zambia's South Luangwa National Park. The two women were trampled by a female elephant that was with its calf and charged at the group. According to local police, tour guides were unable to deter the animal, and both tourists died at the scene. This incident highlights the dangers of wildlife encounters, as female elephants are known to be highly protective of their young.</p>

          <p>A state judge in Missouri has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, issuing a preliminary injunction based on a voter-approved constitutional amendment. The ruling from Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang states the restrictions likely violate the right to abortion established by last year's ballot measure. Planned Parenthood announced it will resume providing procedural abortions, while the Missouri Attorney General's office has declared its intention to appeal the decision immediately, continuing the legal battle.</p>

          <p>Kyiv experienced one of the most intense bombardments of the war, with Russia launching a record 550 drones and 11 missiles overnight. The attacks, which wounded at least 23 people and caused widespread damage, occurred just hours after a call between President Trump and President Putin yielded no progress on a truce. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strikes as cynical and called on international allies to increase pressure on Moscow for its continued aggression.</p>

This article argues the strike's purpose was not to stop an imminent weapon but to deny Iran near-term breakout capability, a goal the CIA believes was achieved. Given Iran's ideology and Israel's security concerns, the future relationship is likely to resemble a new Cold War, characterized by proxy conflicts and covert operations rather than diplomatic resolution. The analysis suggests managed containment is the most realistic path forward.</p>

Rogoff notes that while a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters by making their goods cheaper, it also reflects waning confidence in the American economy's overall strength.
