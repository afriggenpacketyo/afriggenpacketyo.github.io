          <p>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027 faces significant challenges, including rising LNG imports from Russia and divisions among EU member states. Despite a decrease in overall Russian gas share, some countries like France have increased their Russian LNG imports, complicating the EU's REPowerEU plan. Experts suggest reducing overall gas consumption through household energy efficiency measures, but achieving EU unity on energy policy remains crucial for energy security. The article highlights the inconsistency of the EU's approach, switching from one risky supplier to another, and the need for member states to cooperate to achieve energy independence from Russia.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Geneva this week to discuss trade, signaling a potential thaw in the escalating trade war between the global superpowers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng, potentially paving the way for broader trade talks. With both sides feeling the effects of the trade war, experts predict a trade deal will be struck quickly, with the U.S. removing the steep reciprocal tariffs but keeping 20% duties on Chinese goods. The article suggests that both parties are keen to negotiate to avoid a global recession, but must also convince their constituencies that the other side is not evil.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis is experiencing a surge in violence, prompting criticism of the "defund the police" movement and city leadership. A recent mass shooting, where four people were killed and two injured, has highlighted concerns about police staffing levels and morale. Critics argue that lenient prosecution policies and anti-police rhetoric have emboldened criminals, leading to a decline in public safety. The Justice Department has launched an investigation into the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, focusing on whether racial identity is illegally considered in prosecutorial decision-making. The article underscores the ongoing debate over policing strategies and their impact on crime rates in Minneapolis.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have agreed a trade deal to make it cheaper and easier to buy and sell goods and services to one another. The British government said the deal was the "biggest and most economically significant" trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. The deal will also allow British firms to compete for more services contracts in India. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040.</p>
