        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coca-Cola reported strong first-quarter earnings and revenue, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, and reaffirmed its full-year forecast, anticipating organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and comparable earnings per share increase of 2% to 3%. CEO James Quincey emphasized the company's focus on consumer behavior rather than sentiment, sticking to current pricing plans. While competitor PepsiCo trimmed its outlook due to tariff impacts, Coke expects trade conflicts to be manageable due to its primarily local operations, though acknowledging potential cost increases in materials like aluminum and orange juice. Despite a slight dip in net sales, organic revenue increased, driven by higher prices and growth in key markets like India and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned Amazon's plan to show customers the cost of President Trump's tariffs alongside product prices, labeling it a "hostile and political act." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon did not take similar action during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. This criticism follows a report that Amazon will display the tariff amount next to each product's listed price, a move similar to surcharges recently implemented by fast-fashion giants Shein and Temu, which include import charges on their checkout pages. The administration's response underscores the ongoing tensions between the White House and major tech companies regarding trade policies and their impact on consumers.</p>

          <p>Spain and Portugal have largely restored electricity after a major blackout disrupted daily life, leaving officials to investigate the cause, which they have ruled out as a cybersecurity attack, human error, or meteorological events. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez emphasized the government's commitment to uncovering the cause and preventing future occurrences, promising accountability for private operators. Preliminary information suggests a high-voltage connection between France and Spain was interrupted shortly before the outage, though experts say this alone wouldn't typically cause a system collapse. The blackout impacted traffic lights, trains, businesses, and communication networks, causing widespread disruption.</p>

This trend reflects a growing comfort in embracing faith and seeking community, particularly among young Christian women who share the meaning behind their necklaces on TikTok. The cross, historically a symbol of Christian faith, has evolved into a personal talisman and a declaration of shared beliefs. While some see the integration of Christianity and government as a positive reflection of America's founding values, others express uncertainty about the politicization of the symbol.</p>

          <p>A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, including Chicago and Baltimore, has filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's large-scale downsizing of the federal workforce, arguing that these actions are unconstitutional because Congress has not authorized them. The lawsuit targets President Trump's executive order implementing the "Department of Government Efficiency" Workforce Optimization Initiative and the actions taken by agency heads to cut jobs and eliminate programs. Plaintiffs argue that these actions usurp Congress's authority and that the DOGE, overseen by Elon Musk, lacks the statutory power to dictate staffing cuts. The lawsuit seeks to vacate Trump's executive order and halt agencies' reduction in force plans.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presenting attractive savings opportunities with interest rates that can outpace current inflation, helping to preserve and grow buying power. These accounts offer the advantage of locking in high rates for the CD's term and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000, ensuring safety. While national average CD yields range from 1.69% to 2.00%, top CDs from online banks offer significantly higher returns, with some short-term CDs yielding over 4%. Strategies for securing good rates include focusing on online banks and considering short-term CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) has retracted its previous forecast for solid profit growth in 2025, citing uncertainties arising from President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on imported cars and parts.

The company also reported a 7% decline in first-quarter profit, impacted by lower earnings in North America. Despite these challenges, GM's CEO Mary Barra postponed a conference call due to an expected White House announcement on auto tariffs, highlighting the significant influence of trade policies on the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>The suspect in a crossbow attack on the Otley Run pub crawl in Leeds, Owen Lawrence, has died from a self-inflicted wound after posting a hate-filled manifesto online. The manifesto detailed plans for a "massacre" targeting students, nightclub goers, and police. Two women were injured in the attack, one seriously, and a crossbow and firearm were recovered from the scene. Counter Terrorism Policing North East believes Lawrence acted alone and is conducting a thorough investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>Shipments from China to the U.S. are sharply declining due to the Trump administration's high tariffs, leading to warnings of potential supply shortages from major U.S. retailers. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand at 145%, with China retaliating with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing a slowdown in cargo flow, with shipments expected to drop significantly. Retailers, who had previously stockpiled inventory, may face empty shelves this summer as shipments from China have essentially ceased. (not investment advice)</p>

This mismatch has led to both admiration and criticism, as Boone's attempt to blend glam rock with a more traditional image of masculinity challenges established cultural norms.
