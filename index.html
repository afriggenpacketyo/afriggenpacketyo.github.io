          <p>The eastern United States is currently experiencing a severe heat wave, with many cities facing record-high temperatures due to a climate phenomenon known as a "heat dome." Cities such as New York, Boston, and Baltimore have seen temperatures soar, triggering heat warnings for over 150 million people. Hospitals are reporting an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation has been disrupted, with utilities urging customers to conserve power. While the heat is expected to subside somewhat by the weekend, the eastern US will likely see improved conditions over the next few days. </p>

The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with final results expected on July 15.

The researchers noted that establishing such a system must navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises, but could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes.

          <p>The UK is set to acquire 12 new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, signaling a significant expansion of its deterrent capabilities, matching those of China and Russia. The Prime Minister is expected to announce the purchase at the NATO summit in The Hague. These jets will be equipped with U.S.-owned nuclear warheads, while nuclear-armed Trident submarines will remain Britain's primary independent deterrent. This move comes as part of a broader effort to bolster national security in response to evolving global threats. </p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after one such clinic went bankrupt, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These online companies act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not directly regulated by fertility watchdogs. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is calling for stronger laws to protect patients, highlighting cases where patients lost significant amounts of money and faced disruptions to their treatment plans.

          <p>Australian journalist Antoinette Lattouf won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter due to her political views, her race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The court awarded her damages of A$70,000 (Â£33,400, $45,400) and the ABC has since apologized, acknowledging that it had "let down our staff and audiences" in its handling of the matter. The case has raised questions over the broadcaster's independence. </p>

Key elements include a housing caveat requiring CEQA exemptions, changes to Med-Cal funding, and measures to address uncertainty about federal policy changes. Lawmakers and the governor agreed to delay a $3.4-billion payment on a loan to cover Medi-Cal cost overruns. (not investment advice)</p>
