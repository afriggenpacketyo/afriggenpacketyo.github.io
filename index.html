          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has claimed responsibility for a new attack on Russia's Kerch Strait Bridge, which connects occupied Crimea to Russia. According to the SBU, the attack involved mining the bridge's supports, resulting in significant damage to the underwater piers using 1,100 kg of explosives in TNT equivalent, rendering the bridge in a state of emergency. The SBU chief, Vasyl Malyuk, stated that this operation continues the agency's previous attacks on the bridge in 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, Russia continued long-range attacks on multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries.

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has been classified as an England and Wales project, sparking anger as no tracks will be laid in Wales, meaning the country will not benefit from extra cash. Politicians argue that Wales is being denied hundreds of millions in funding that could transform its own rail network, similar to the HS2 controversy. The UK government claims the project is funded through its rail network enhancements pipeline, which also funds projects in Wales, such as the redevelopment of Cardiff Central Station. The Welsh government clarified that a pipeline of work had been agreed with the UK government to make up for under-investment by previous governments. The article shows how infrastructure projects can cause controversy when it comes to funding distribution.</p>

Many millennials find themselves reevaluating their careers and lives, impacted by economic factors like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges, there's a sense of optimism and a focus on self-discovery and creating a fulfilling life.

The discovery provides a glimpse into the island's history and the community that once thrived there before being largely swept into the ocean by hurricanes.
