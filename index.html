          <p>The US Air Force has commenced ground tests of new AI-driven combat drones, escalating its technological rivalry with China in the development of unmanned weapons systems. The YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A drones, created by General Atomics and Anduril, are the first unmanned aircraft to receive fighter designations in US military history. General David Allvin, the US Air Force chief of staff, highlighted the tests as a crucial step for the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program. This program signifies a strategic move towards autonomous aerial warfare, using uncrewed aircraft alongside crewed fighter jets to enhance combat capabilities. Relevant context: This development underscores the intensifying global race to innovate in military technology, with AI playing an increasingly pivotal role.</p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a group of periodical cicadas, is set to emerge across large portions of the eastern US after spending the last 17 years underground. These insects, which have missed significant global events, will surface around May and June, living only a few weeks to mate and lay eggs. The map provided offers a general idea of where Brood XIV will appear, with a more detailed version available from the University of Connecticut. This emergence is expected to shape ecosystems by providing a food source for various species, potentially increasing bird populations and altering hunting patterns, essentially rewiring forest food webs.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has announced the acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal, expected to close in the second half of 2025.

DoorDash also stated that they have agreed to a takeover offer from American rival Doordash worth $3.9 billion. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash reported an 18% increase in total orders for the quarter, totaling 732 million. The acquisition of SevenRooms is aimed at expanding DoorDash's capabilities in providing world-class services and supporting local commerce and financial goals.</p>

          <p>Louisiana authorities have charged a second suspect, Rickey White, with second-degree murder in connection to the death of Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, who was found dead in his hotel room while covering the Super Bowl. Manzano's autopsy revealed that he died after ingesting a combination of alcohol and Xanax, and security footage showed Manzano and Danette Colbert entering his room together the day of his death, and Colbert leaving without him an hour later. Colbert, the first suspect charged in the case, was later found to be in communication with White, and police believe they were working together to incapacitate Manzano and steal his belongings. White was arrested in Florida on robbery and fraud charges before being extradited to Louisiana.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US exports are experiencing a broad decline, particularly affecting the agricultural sector, with products like soybeans, corn, and beef taking the hardest hit. Trade data indicates that this export slump, which began in January, now extends to most US ports, with the Port of Oregon seeing a 51% decrease. This decline is linked to a reduction in containerships coming to the US as businesses cancel manufacturing orders due to tariffs driving costs higher, leading to difficult decisions for importers. Retailers are advising consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as inventory levels may become lean in the coming months due to these supply chain disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, failed to secure a majority in the parliament vote to become chancellor, receiving only 310 votes out of the required 316 in the 630-seat Bundestag. This defeat is considered unprecedented in modern German history, potentially undermining his hopes to stabilize the government after the previous one collapsed. The Bundestag has 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate, with the possibility of a simple majority vote if no absolute majority is reached. Political commentators view this outcome as a humiliation, with the far-right Alternative for Germany calling for fresh elections.</p>

          <p>The popular Japanese all-male idol group Arashi, currently on hiatus since the end of 2020, has announced it will disband after a final tour next spring.

They plan to hold a concert to express gratitude to their fans through in-person performances, which were not possible due to the coronavirus pandemic. Arashi is one of the most successful idol groups created by Starto Entertainment Inc., and its members have been active in music, movies, TV dramas, variety shows, and commercials since their debut in 1999.</p>

These portraits continue the tradition of coronation portraits, with immediate reactions to Kuhfeld's work being more favorable compared to the previous polarizing artwork.

          <p>Friedrich Merz has faced challenges in his attempt to form Germany's new government, marked by low personal popularity and distrust among many Germans. A recent poll indicated that only 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy, reflecting a decline in his public image. This unpopularity is attributed to his approach to the far-right AfD and his perceived betrayal of voters through debt brake reforms. Additionally, Merz has faced accusations of misogyny and unpopularity in eastern Germany, further complicating his path to becoming chancellor.</p>

          <p>A chair of a trial committee of the Writers Guild of America West has criticized the union’s handling of disciplinary proceedings against a member accused of violating strike rules in 2023. Jill Goldsmith, a former public defender, expressed concerns over the process behind the board’s decision to expel one writer, saying it was not “fair and proper.” Goldsmith resigned from the committee in protest, questioning whether the committee’s impartial legal counsel unfairly influenced the proceeding’s outcome. The WGAW declined to comment on the specific claims, stating that the board is responsible for determining the level of discipline when a member is found guilty.</p>

Labour's share has declined across the country, with Reform leading in the Midlands and the South outside of London. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, and predictions for the number of seats Reform could win in an election vary.</p>

They argue, in essence, that universities have become so left-leaning and divorced from traditional educational principles that they no longer deserve a public subsidy.
