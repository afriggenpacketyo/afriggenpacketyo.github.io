          <p>Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart, at 84, recently disclosed that her widely shared "thirst trap" photos have resulted in a significant volume of flirtatious direct messages on her Instagram from hopeful suitors. Despite this attention, Stewart stated that she is currently single, emphasizing that her happiness stems from her extensive circle of friends. She has deliberately cultivated this more provocative public image since a poolside selfie went viral in 2020 when she was 78, which subsequently led to notable opportunities like becoming the oldest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model at 81. Stewart, who celebrated her birthday last month, also conveyed her preference for focusing on successful living and not aging, deeming the latter topic "boring" and advocating for a forward-looking perspective on life.</p>

          <p>One person was tragically killed and several others sustained injuries during a shooting incident that occurred Saturday night at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire. Authorities swiftly detained a person of interest, with surveillance footage confirming a single shooter, and assured the public that there is no further danger. The circumstances and exact number of victims remain under investigation by the New Hampshire Attorney General's office and Nashua Police. A witness at a wedding inside the country club reported that the shooting took place in an adjacent restaurant, where someone bravely intervened by hitting the suspect with a chair before the individual fled through the reception area.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, which formed earlier this week, continued to strengthen over the central Atlantic Ocean on Saturday, marking it as the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The Miami-based National Hurricane Center forecasts that Gabrielle is likely to become a hurricane by Sunday and its center is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, although no watches or warnings are currently in effect for any landmass. The weather system is predicted to remain over open waters for several days, but distant swells from Gabrielle are anticipated to reach the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada starting Sunday. This development occurs in an Atlantic hurricane season that has, so far, been less active than initial NOAA predictions suggested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese research team, comprising scientists from Sun Yat-sen, Fuzhou, and Shanghai Normal Universities, recently published significant findings in the peer-reviewed National Science Review. Their analysis revealed the detection of 41 new landslides on the moon that have formed since 2009, attributing these geological events to moonquakes. This discovery challenges the long-held conventional geological understanding that the moon's internal activity had essentially ceased, underscoring a previously unexplored aspect of lunar seismicity. The research is particularly pertinent as human civilization progresses towards establishing permanent infrastructures on the moon, emphasizing the critical need for enhanced geological hazard assessments to ensure the safety of future scientific research stations and deep-space outposts.</p>

This legislative action comes amidst ongoing immigration enforcement operations directed by President Trump, which Newsom characterized as a "terror campaign." Federal officials, however, argue the laws are despicable and endanger officers, asserting that California has no jurisdiction over federal operations and that their agents will continue to protect their identities.</p>

Although police have not announced a suspect or indicated a crime occurred, and d4vd is cooperating, the circumstances are under investigation. Rivas was reported missing last year from Lake Elsinore, and neighbors noted she had a boyfriend named David with whom she shared matching tattoos, adding a layer of complexity to the unfolding case.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan, a former defense attorney, to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. This move follows the abrupt resignation of Erik Siebert, the previous head, who reportedly faced pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Trump explicitly stated he fired Siebert, criticizing his perceived lack of action and support from Democratic senators. Halligan's appointment is framed by Trump as bringing "Justice for All" and countering the "Weaponization of our Justice System," while critics view it as political interference in the justice system.</p>

The article underscores his consistent MVP-level performance for nearly a decade and his remarkable loyalty to the Angels, having twice chosen to extend his contract rather than explore free agency.

This revelation comes despite her public statements weeks prior, where she had vehemently distanced herself from Epstein and expressed abhorrence for sexual assault, calling her past involvement a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the Duchess clarified that the email was sent under significant pressure, as Epstein had threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with sexual assault. The spokesperson asserts that the Duchess stands by her public condemnation of Epstein and that the email was an attempt to assuage his threats, not an genuine expression of affection.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve recently implemented its first interest rate cut of the year, lowering its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, a move that initially spurred record highs in stock markets. Paradoxically, bond traders responded by "selling the news," leading to an increase in long-term bond yields, including those directly affecting mortgage rates. This unexpected market reaction indicates that investors in longer-dated bonds are concerned the Fed might be easing monetary policy too aggressively while inflation remains above its 2% target and the economy appears stable, potentially signaling a lack of focus on inflation. The rise in long-term rates has immediate implications for the costs of mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, with homebuilders like Lennar already noting "elevated" interest rates as a persistent pressure in the current housing market.

          <p>Despite a cautious consumer sentiment and rising inflation in the U.S., sales of used electric vehicles (EVs) have significantly increased, with a 40% spike in July. This surge is attributed to the discovery that pre-owned EVs often have lower sticker prices than comparable internal combustion engine cars, a fact that challenges the common perception of high EV costs. These savings are even more substantial when factoring in reduced maintenance and fuel expenses. The trend indicates a shift in the automotive market, with EVs accounting for 9.9% of all cars sold in August, even as Tesla's market share dipped amidst increased competition and CEO Elon Musk's controversial statements.</p>

Conversely, the affected states argue that ICE detainers are voluntary requests and that detaining individuals without a judge's warrant can lead to constitutional challenges, citing Fourth Amendment protections.

This injury, which initially did not appear on X-rays or an MRI, was only confirmed after a second scan. While the Dodgers have managed to perform well in Smith's absence, benefiting from the capable play of journeyman Ben Rortvedt, his central presence in the batting order is considered vital for the team to be at its peak form during the postseason.</p>

Despite multiple federal officials reportedly believing they had a solid criminal case for conspiracy to commit bribery, the investigation, which originated under the Biden administration, was stalled and subsequently closed by Trump-appointed Justice Department officials.

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including shooting into an occupied building and assault with a deadly weapon, following a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 TV station in Sacramento. At least three bullets were fired into the lobby window of the station, which was occupied at the time, though fortunately no one was injured. Hernandezsantana was booked into the Sacramento County Main Jail but subsequently released on a $200,000 bail. The incident took place a day after protests outside the station related to the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC, but police have stated that the motive for the shooting remains under active investigation. The event has drawn widespread condemnation from journalists and organizations, who view it as an unacceptable act of violence against the media.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash flooding that recently impacted the Southwest U.S. is expected to return, with a heightened risk for parts of California, Arizona, and western New Mexico on Sunday and Monday due to incoming monsoonal moisture. This follows a tragic incident in Barstow, California, where a 2-year-old was swept away and killed by floodwaters. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Gabrielle in the central Atlantic is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday, passing east of Bermuda and generating dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina to Maine. The article also notes an increase in overall Atlantic tropical activity is anticipated in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has boldly predicted that by 2030, society will achieve "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance" in all aspects of life, including medical care, food, and housing, as AI and robots replace most human jobs. He envisions a future where intelligent humanoid robots will far outnumber humans, with each person having their own personal robot and many more in industry. This vision contrasts with typical universal basic income discussions, as Musk insists on a "high" income. However, critics question the feasibility and funding mechanisms for such a system, especially given current economic challenges and political roadblocks to even modest universal programs.

          <p>Ava Pickett's new stage adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" boldly reimagines the story for the 21st century, setting it in contemporary Essex where the protagonist, Emma Woodhouse, navigates her friends' love lives through dating apps and clubbing. This fresh take maintains Emma's signature cleverness and meddling nature, but places her in a modern context after she returns home from failing her exams at Oxford University. Pickett, who drew on her own post-university experiences, aims to explore the universal themes of jealousy and love within a contemporary framework, including the often "toxic" dynamics of online dating. The article highlights this adaptation as part of a broader trend of Jane Austen's works finding new life in modern media, underscoring the enduring relevance of her narratives.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students in England are forced to juggle extensive paid work alongside their studies, or endure long commutes, because their maintenance loans fail to cover basic living costs. Research indicates that maximum annual loans cover only about half of freshers' expenses, leading to a monthly shortfall of over £500 on average. The article highlights stories like Tianna Hunkins, who works 30 hours a week and wears her uniform to lectures, and Faith Webb, who commutes 1.5 hours each way to save on rent. This financial pressure often forces students to miss out on academic opportunities and social life, impacting their overall university experience.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog" and improving short-term memory and focus. While primarily known for enhancing athletic performance, emerging research suggests it may also help the brain produce more energy, similar to its effect on muscles. The article highlights anecdotal evidence from women, including those in perimenopause, who report clearer thinking and improved mood after taking creatine. Experts emphasize that while the research is promising and an "exciting time" for the field, more studies are needed, and its effectiveness might be most noticeable in individuals experiencing stress or dietary deficiencies.</p>

          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer decided to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, as a strategic move amidst deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Gaza and growing pressure from his own party. The decision, contingent on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and a two-state solution, marks a significant shift in British foreign policy. While government sources believe it will have an impact on the ground, critics view it as "gesture politics" and a reward for Hamas. The move also puts the UK at odds with the US, and has created domestic political challenges for Labour, who face accusations of prioritizing foreign policy over domestic issues.</p>

          <p>Heightened security measures, including "TSA-level screening," are being implemented for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, where President Trump and numerous prominent figures of the American right are expected to convene. The event, organized by Turning Point USA, is projected to draw over 100,000 attendees across the main stadium and an overflow area. Kirk's death two weeks prior has significantly exacerbated political divisions in the U.S., with the Trump administration attributing blame to the "radical left" and critics raising concerns about potential government overreach. The Secret Service also reported an incident involving an armed individual impersonating law enforcement near the venue, further underscoring the palpable tensions surrounding the high-profile memorial.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has implemented new, stricter regulations for press access, mandating that journalists agree not to disclose unauthorized information or face the potential loss of their credentials and entry to the facility. These updated guidelines, which also impose limitations on journalists' movement within the building, come in the wake of several recent information leaks. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth publicly asserted that the press "does not run the Pentagon" and underscored the imperative to safeguard sensitive national security information. While the department claims a continued commitment to transparency, it emphasizes that all information must receive approval for public release. Critics, however, highlight Hegseth's own prior incident of inadvertently sharing sensitive information, raising questions about the administration's consistency and potential implications for press freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced legislation mandating that all public universities in the state erect a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza" with a statue of the assassinated activist and signage calling him a "modern civil rights leader." Failure to comply would result in monthly fines of 1% of the school's budget. This proposal reflects a broader conservative effort to elevate Kirk's legacy, comparing him to figures like Martin Luther King Jr., a comparison rejected by King's children due to Kirk's controversial statements on race and gender. The bill also includes measures to protect the memorials from vandalism, with automatic expulsion for defacing students, despite polling showing widespread student disagreement with Kirk's views.</p>
