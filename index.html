          <p>Chinese researchers have engineered a two-kilowatt fiber laser capable of operating without cooling systems in extreme temperatures, ranging from -50Â°C in the Arctic to 50Â°C in the Sahara Desert. This portable device, designed for defense and industrial applications, uses 940-nanometer pump lasers with minimal thermal drift and innovative heat isolation techniques. The laser's core features a dual-clad optical resonator with ytterbium-doped fibers, emitting a lethal 1,080nm beam. This breakthrough addresses a decades-long challenge of maintaining stable laser performance across wide temperature ranges, offering a more versatile and rapidly deployable laser solution.</p>

          <p>The global market is reacting to the recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with heightened geopolitical tensions taking center stage. Simultaneously, the NATO Summit in The Hague is anticipated to be contentious, as the US President is expected to pressure European nations to increase defense spending, while some countries call the 5% of GDP target "unreasonable." Elsewhere, the Summer Davos in Tianjin, China, will focus on technology amid ongoing trade negotiations with the US, and Germany's Day of Industry event will highlight the country's restarting economic growth. These events collectively contribute to a complex and uncertain global economic and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Following US involvement in the Israeli operation against Iran, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table.

He stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons, and that the US has taken action to alleviate that threat. The US bombing of Fordo and other key nuclear sites in Iran overnight prompted this response.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has directly engaged in the conflict between Israel and Iran by attacking Iranian nuclear sites. U.S. Navy submarines launched over 30 Tomahawk missiles into Iran, with Trump stating the U.S. and Israel worked closely together. The strikes targeted key nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the goal of crippling Iran's nuclear program. This action marks a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in the Middle East, reversing Trump's earlier promises to avoid new wars, and has closed the door on potential diplomatic negotiations.</p>

Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck, but deny it had suffered a major blow, while the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization called the bombing a barbaric violation of international law. The strikes, which mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel, involved targets including Fordo, a uranium enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside. Experts suggest that only the US possesses a "bunker buster" bomb capable of significantly damaging Fordo, though the extent of the damage remains unclear.</p>

Investigators found the house locked, curtains closed, and a missing shotgun, leading them to believe the crime wasn't a burglary. Jeff was grounded for stealing weeks before prom, which meant his father had to drive him to the prom, causing Jeff significant embarrassment. Despite lacking forensic evidence, Jeff Pelley was convicted in 2006 based on circumstantial evidence and timeline, and is currently appealing his denial for post-conviction relief.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. had completed strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, a move that has sparked mixed reactions from American politicians. While some Republicans cheered the action, others, along with many Democrats, condemned the strikes, particularly because they were carried out without congressional approval. The strikes targeted uranium enrichment sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, with Trump warning Iran against retaliation. The political landscape in Washington remains deeply divided as the U.S. grapples with another military intervention overseas.</p>

While Germany has become increasingly attractive, many Turks still maintain strong ties to their culture and consider Turkey their home.
