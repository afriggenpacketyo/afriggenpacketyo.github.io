          <p>In a complex development in the New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate. This move came after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo challenged only Mamdani, amid reports the Trump administration wants other candidates to drop out to create a two-person race. The campaigns for incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa have rejected calls to exit the race, adding further intrigue to the city's contentious election.</p>

          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly prevalent in American culture, with a third of adults now having at least one, signaling a shift towards greater acceptance and individuality. Despite this mainstream embrace, particularly among millennials, research indicates that some societal stigma remains, occasionally affecting perceptions in professional settings. Art institutions are beginning to recognize tattooing as a legitimate art form, though about a quarter of those with tattoos express some regret over their decision.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is seeing beneficial results from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers at Lakeside High School report that the ban has created a better learning environment, reduced distractions, and allowed them to regain students' attention, which they felt was a "losing battle." The principal noted significant improvements in student conduct and engagement since the pilot program was introduced, reflecting a growing national trend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has filed a lawsuit against the AI company Midjourney, alleging its image generator illegally produces replicas of copyright-protected characters like Superman, Batman, and Scooby-Doo. The suit claims Midjourney built its business by training its AI on the studio's intellectual property without permission, constituting content theft. This action aligns Warner Bros. with Disney and Universal Pictures, who filed a similar lawsuit, escalating the legal battle between major Hollywood studios and generative AI firms.</p>

Jones emphasized the move was not personal but a strategic one to maximize the number of high-quality players on the field for the same cost.</p>
