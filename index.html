          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector saw significant gains after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major spending bill. The tax, which targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, would have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the industry. While the removal provided immediate relief, boosting shares for companies like NextEra Energy and Array Technologies, industry associations still view the overall legislation as detrimental to renewable energy. They warn that the bill's phase-out of key tax credits undermines America's progress in clean energy manufacturing and leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

In social media posts and remarks to reporters, Trump indicated that Musk's businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX, rely heavily on government support and could be targeted by his administration's efficiency department. The public dispute, reignited by Musk's criticism of a major tax and spending bill, has created market uncertainty for the electric vehicle manufacturer. Musk responded by stating he supports cutting all subsidies, including his own. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The families of the four murdered University of Idaho students are split over a potential plea deal for the accused, Bryan Kohberger. The deal would see Kohberger plead guilty and receive four consecutive life sentences, avoiding the death penalty and a lengthy trial. Ben Mogen, father of victim Madison Mogen, expressed relief at the prospect of closure, while the family of Kaylee Goncalves is "beyond furious," demanding a full confession and accountability rather than a deal.

While promising business as usual for now, Santander has not ruled out future branch closures and has indicated that job cuts are likely due to role duplication. The takeover marks another chapter for TSB, which has a history of ownership changes and a major IT failure in 2018. (not investment advice)</p>

The drone maker intends to offer $750 million in common stock and $600 million in convertible senior notes, using the proceeds primarily for debt repayment and other general corporate purposes. This decline follows a period of massive growth for the company, with its stock having soared 85% this year, partly fueled by strong earnings and its recent acquisition of Blue Halo.

          <p>The Senate's passage of President Trump's budget bill marks a significant shift in American healthcare, fundamentally altering Medicaid with new work requirements and spending cuts. According to this analysis, the legislation will lead to dire consequences, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating nearly 12 million people could lose their health insurance. The article argues that by enacting these changes, which also coincide with the expiration of Obamacare subsidies, the Republican party now "owns" the resulting healthcare system. This sets the stage for future political battles, as Democrats will likely frame the debate around repairing the damage caused by these cuts.</p>

          <p>The Senate has approved a sweeping tax and spending package that could significantly affect household finances across America by making many 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new ones. Key provisions include raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, increasing the child tax credit, and creating a new "senior bonus" deduction for older Americans. However, the bill also proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, reduces SNAP food assistance, and ends tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. It further overhauls federal student loans by imposing new borrowing limits and eliminating certain repayment and deferment options. (not investment advice)</p>

Jurors also wanted to rehear testimony from a witness who described an incident where Ventura appeared terrified of Combs.

Mamdani, a naturalized U.S. citizen, condemned the president's remarks as an "attack on our democracy" and an attempt at intimidation.

          <p>The budget bill passed by the Senate contains approximately $150 billion in funding to significantly bolster President Trump's hard-line immigration agenda. The legislation allocates tens of billions for border wall construction, hiring thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents, and building and operating more immigrant detention facilities. It also introduces unprecedented new fees for asylum seekers and makes it easier for local law enforcement to partner with federal immigration authorities. Critics argue these provisions will supercharge a harsh enforcement system and make it harder for vulnerable migrants to seek protection.</p>

Riggen reflects that her film, which told a heartwarming story of a Mexican boy seeking his undocumented mother, was intended to humanize immigrants. If she were to make the movie today, she says its tone would be much grimmer to reflect the harsher political climate.</p>

          <p>A public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk has renewed questions about the billionaire's U.S. citizenship and whether he could be deported. Musk, who was born in South Africa to a South African father and a Canadian mother, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Despite Trump's suggestions that he might "take a look" at the issue and that Musk could "head back home to South Africa," legal experts indicate that deporting a naturalized citizen is extremely difficult. The conflict arose after Musk criticized a major spending bill, prompting Trump to threaten a review of federal subsidies for Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>The new film "40 Acres" is a post-apocalyptic thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler as a military veteran fiercely protecting her family on an isolated farmstead in a world ravaged by pandemic and famine. The review praises Deadwyler's performance, which grounds the character's brutal survivalist mentality in deep-seated generational trauma and fear. While the film is noted for its heavy-handed symbolism and sometimes confusing allusions, it succeeds as a resolute portrait of a family's desperate self-reliance. The movie is described as a grim but gripping story, highlighted by a tense score and strong supporting performances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has officially ended its operations, with its remaining programs now being administered by the State Department. The Trump administration stated the move will align foreign assistance more directly with American interests and deliver it with greater efficiency, a key goal of its government reduction efforts. However, the decision has drawn sharp criticism, including from former presidents and humanitarian organizations, who warn of devastating consequences. A recent study published in The Lancet projected that the funding cuts associated with USAID's closure could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030.</p>

In response, Musk has harshly criticized the bill as an "insane" spending package and vowed to form a new political party to challenge lawmakers who support it.

However, vaccine experts interviewed by NPR highlight significant problems with this study, noting its reliance on data from the 1980s and methodological limitations. Furthermore, the World Health Organization and other bodies have repeatedly reviewed the evidence and found no negative effect from DTP vaccination. Experts warn that cutting funds to Gavi, which vaccinates millions of children in low-income countries, based on this flawed evidence could have devastating global health consequences.</p>

The judge found "no rational basis" for the plan, which was challenged by 19 Democratic attorneys general who warned of "devastating consequences" to public health services.
