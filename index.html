        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to curtail federal support for electric vehicles (EVs) are creating uncertainty within the EV charging industry.  The suspension of the NEVI program, designed to build a nationwide network of EV chargers, has caused delays and confusion among states and charging companies. This situation is further complicated by trade wars and the general slowdown in EV sales.<br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
