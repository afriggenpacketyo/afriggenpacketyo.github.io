          <p>Citizens in Switzerland are voting in a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system, with early projections showing a tight race. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data protection concerns and the involvement of private firms in its operation. The revised plan ensures the system is optional, managed entirely by the state, and stores data on users' smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue it will streamline bureaucratic processes online, while opponents remain concerned about potential privacy infringements and data misuse, despite the new safeguards designed to limit access to specific personal details.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has urged his Labour Party to unite against the rising right-wing Reform UK party ahead of Labour's annual conference. Facing historically low approval ratings, with only 13% of voters satisfied with his leadership, Starmer is positioning the conference as a critical moment to rally support. Recent high-profile resignations and controversies over unpopular policies, such as means-testing winter fuel payments, have compounded his challenges. Starmer acknowledged the difficult political landscape but emphasized the need to focus on confronting Reform UK rather than engaging in internal party disputes, as polls suggest a significant threat in the next election.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian aerial assault involving nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles has struck seven regions across Ukraine, killing at least four people in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl. The bombardment, one of the heaviest in recent months, lasted for over 12 hours and damaged over 100 civilian sites, including a cardiology institute and a large bakery. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as "vile," vowing retaliation and calling for a strong international response, particularly after a week of UN General Assembly meetings. The attack prompted neighboring countries like Poland to scramble jets as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials, the Trump administration is reportedly considering more deals to bolster the U.S. supply chain for critical minerals like rare earths and lithium. Industry leaders are urging for federal investment, including price floors, to counter China's market dominance and stabilize volatile prices for miners. This strategic shift, which mimics China's model of state-backed capitalism, has caused significant stock surges for companies like Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas, which are seen as potential targets for government support. The goal is to reduce dependency on foreign nations for materials essential to defense and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

The peak travel day is expected to be Wednesday, with projections of over 340 million journeys, surpassing the numbers seen during this year's Lunar New Year holiday.</p>

          <p>This article presents a case for the revival of jury nullification as a tool to combat what it describes as the Trump administration's use of the Justice Department for political persecution. Citing the historical example of an abolitionist's acquittal, the author argues that jurors have the right to refuse conviction if they deem a law, or its application, to be unjust. The piece suggests that as the administration targets political opponents, everyday citizens serving on juries may be the last line of defense for the rule of law. It posits that jurors can and should reject indictments and convictions in cases they believe are motivated by political retribution rather than legitimate legal concerns.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. While there are no immediate watches or warnings, residents of Bermuda are urged to monitor its progress closely as it could bring hazardous conditions within days. The storm is currently located about 585 miles south of Bermuda and is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days. Swells generated by Humberto are forecast to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast starting Monday. Forecasters are also monitoring a second system, Tropical Depression Nine, which could impact Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he stabbed in the neck while she slept in 2021. Immediately after the incident, he called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming and later stated he was sleepwalking. The case presents a profound mystery, as family, friends, and even prosecutors could find no evidence of conflict or motive behind the killing. A sleep disorder expert who conducted two studies on Benjamin supports the defense's claim, believing he acted involuntarily during a slow-wave sleep episode. Prosecutors remain skeptical, questioning his account and the physical evidence at the scene.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has expressed strong support for Argentine President Javier Milei's radical, Thatcher-inspired economic policies, with the U.S. offering potential financial aid as Argentina faces a new crisis. Milei's "shock therapy" approach, which includes deep public spending cuts and privatization to combat hyperinflation, has won praise from the IMF but has led to recession, rising unemployment, and increased household debt within Argentina. Trump's backing is seen as part of a broader strategy to use economic tools for political ends, propping up an ideological ally. Some experts also suggest that geopolitical concerns, particularly China's growing influence in Latin America, motivate Washington's intervention.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Pfizer is being sued in a U.S. class action lawsuit on behalf of over 1,300 women who allege they developed benign brain tumors (intracranial meningiomas) from using the contraceptive injection Depo-Provera. The lawsuit claims Pfizer failed to adequately warn patients and doctors about the increased risk associated with prolonged use of the drug. A recent study linked the active ingredient to a 5.6-fold higher risk of these tumors. Pfizer argues that it is protected from liability because the FDA had previously rejected its attempt to add a tumor warning to the drug's label, a defense the plaintiffs are challenging in court.</p>

The author contends that by defying court orders, attacking the judiciary, and revoking legal statuses, the administration has abandoned the principle of limited government. The article highlights the Supreme Court's role in enabling this by frequently siding with the administration and weakening judicial checks on executive power. Comparing the U.S. response to January 6 with Brazil's conviction of its former president for a similar event, the author calls for peaceful action to hold the executive accountable.</p>

Tool marks suggest it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact.

          <p>More than 100,000 U.S. federal workers are set to resign this week as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program, marking a historic reduction in the federal workforce. Employees who accepted the offer describe an environment of "fear and intimidation" and a loss of mission, leaving them feeling they had no other choice. The administration argues the program, part of a plan to cut 275,000 jobs, will save $28 billion annually by creating a more modern, at-will employment framework. This mass departure coincides with a potential government shutdown, as the White House has also directed agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if a funding deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>A report from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV claims that the nation's J-35 stealth fighter jet has a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, suggesting a high level of stealth capability. The low observability is attributed to the aircraft's unique airframe design and the use of proprietary metamaterial technology. This claim positions the J-35 as a formidable competitor in stealth technology. For comparison, the report notes that the radar cross-section of the U.S. F-35 fighter is often cited as being around the size of a golf ball, indicating the two aircraft may have comparable stealth characteristics.</p>

He describes the experience as both deeply moving and unsettling, providing a sense of connection but also raising questions about the nature of grief and memory.

These moves, backed by significant funding and sponsor pressure, dramatically raised the standard of play and created immense strength in depth for the national team, the Red Roses.

The UK, France, and Germany activated the "snapback" provision, citing Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with inspectors. This move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear sites in June, though inspections have reportedly since resumed. The reimposition marks a significant blow to the already fragile deal, which was weakened when the U.S. withdrew in 2018.

Led by associate professor Xu Xiaohui, the research addresses the challenge of destroying deeply buried and hardened military targets that are resistant to conventional weapons. This new simulation capability allows for the study of the complex impact of multiple high-yield nuclear detonations in close succession. The development highlights a focus on advanced strategic weapon effects as part of China's military modernization efforts.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris's recently published campaign memoir, "107 Days," is facing criticism from some Democrats for its perceived lack of self-blame and its mild critiques of the Biden administration. The book also reveals tensions with potential 2028 presidential rivals, including her longtime political frenemy, California Governor Gavin Newsom. Harris recounts an instance where Newsom was unresponsive via text in the crucial hours after President Biden withdrew from the race, an anecdote that highlights the complex relationship between the two prominent Democrats. The memoir's release has sparked debate about Harris's political future and whether she is positioning herself for another White House run.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is exploring the possibility of leasing a portion of Camp Pendleton for commercial development, a move that would be unprecedented for the 125,000-acre military base. As the largest undeveloped stretch of coastline in Southern California, the base is a critical training ground for the Marine Corps and a vital wildlife habitat. The discussions align with the Trump administration's push to use public lands for revenue generation. While details remain scarce, any development could significantly impact local communities like Oceanside and has raised concerns among conservationists who praise the base's success in protecting endangered species.</p>

          <p>Despite a government ban, the candied barrel cactus known as acitrón remains a popular and widely sold ingredient in Mexico, essential for traditional dishes like chiles en nogada. The ban was enacted in the early 2000s to protect the biznaga cactus, which is facing extinction due to overharvesting. The cactus grows extremely slowly, making sustainable farming impractical and leading to its illegal harvesting from the wild. While many consumers and vendors continue to use acitrón to uphold culinary traditions, some prominent chefs are adapting recipes with sustainable alternatives, like candied squash, to help preserve the endangered species while maintaining the dish's cultural significance.</p>

          <p>A stampede at a political rally in Karur, India, has resulted in the deaths of at least 39 people, including eight children, with over 50 others injured. The incident occurred as a crowd of at least 30,000 gathered for an event held by the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) party, led by popular actor-turned-politician Vijay. Reports suggest the crush happened after a long delay caused the crowd to become restless, with some rushing towards the politician's bus. In response to the tragedy, authorities have filed a criminal case against senior leaders of the TVK party, and an investigation is now underway.</p>

          <p>An off-duty Washington, D.C. firefighter, Gary Dziekan, was shot during an attempted robbery just steps from his Capitol Hill home. After being shot, he dialed 911 but received no answer for three minutes while bleeding on the ground. He then called his own fire station directly for help, and his colleagues were the first to arrive on the scene. The incident highlights ongoing issues with the city's understaffed and embattled 911 dispatch system. Meanwhile, the 17-year-old suspect was apprehended by a joint force of local and federal law enforcement and will be tried as an adult under the Trump administration's crackdown on crime in the city.</p>

The F-150 Lightning also saw a 21% increase in sales. Ford is supporting the transition to EVs by offering complimentary home chargers and installation, a unique initiative aimed at improving customer experience. With a new $30,000 all-electric truck planned for 2027, the company is betting on continued momentum in the EV market.</p>

          <p>Amid soaring housing costs, a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are teaming up with friends or relatives to purchase homes. With national home prices up 56% since 2020, co-buying allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome the significant affordability gap, which is especially challenging for single buyers. Recent housing industry reports indicate that about 15% of homebuyers purchased with a non-romantic partner. While this strategy provides a path to homeownership and companionship, it also requires careful legal planning, as friends lack the built-in property protections that married couples have, necessitating detailed co-ownership agreements.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans who support a permanent legislative solution for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are indicating that any negotiations must be initiated by President Trump. Despite bipartisan support for bills like one introduced by Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, the broader Republican coalition for DACA has weakened since 2017. As the Trump administration expands its mass deportation efforts, concerns are growing for the program's half a million recipients, some of whom have already been detained. However, key Republican lawmakers state that the administration's current focus on border enforcement must be addressed before any deal for DACA recipients can be seriously considered.</p>

He argued that allowing U.S. tech firms to compete globally maximizes America's economic success and geopolitical influence.

The election is being closely watched as Sandu's ruling party could lose its majority, and two pro-Russian parties were disqualified just before the vote over claims of illegal financing.

The arrests are a major development in a violent, 25-year feud between the Lyons and Daniel crime families, which has recently seen a new wave of violence across central Scotland. Police Scotland believes the men are linked to drug importation and other serious crimes. The feud, which has involved murders and targeted attacks, has recently gone global, with leaders directing operations from abroad.
