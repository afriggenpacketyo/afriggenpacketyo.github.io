          <p>The Department of Education has warned Columbia University's accreditor that the institution violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. This warning follows protests related to the Israel-Hamas war, with allegations that Columbia leadership failed to address harassment of Jewish students. The Department claims Columbia did not establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024 and failed to abide by its own policies when responding to complaints. Now, Columbia's accreditor must establish a compliance plan or face action against the university. The optimism score for this article reflects the seriousness of the allegations and the potential consequences for the university.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were safely defused in Cologne, Germany, necessitating the evacuation of over 20,000 residents from the city center. The bombs, discovered during road construction preparations, included two 20-ton bombs and one 10-ton bomb, each with impact fuses. This operation marked the city's largest evacuation since the end of the war, highlighting the ongoing risk posed by unexploded ordnance in Germany.

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling 14 flights a day through July due to tariffs hindering the delivery of new Embraer 175 regional jets. The airline is avoiding extra tariff-related costs by delaying the acceptance of these aircraft, which were intended for its regional subsidiary, Horizon Air. These tariffs, part of President Trump's trade policies, have disrupted supply chains and increased costs for various businesses. Delta Air Lines previously avoided tariffs by having new Airbus A350 aircraft delivered to Japan before bringing them to the U.S. to avoid being subject to tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about escalating attacks between Russia and Ukraine. Putin stated strongly that he will have to respond to the recent attack on airfields, which was a major topic of discussion during their 65-minute call. The U.S. believes Russia is preparing to retaliate against Ukraine for the drone strikes, and Trump has vowed to end the war in 24 hours but months of failed talks have left his administration frustrated. The two leaders emphasized the exchange of views as positive and productive, confirming their readiness to remain in contact.</p>

The power to remove Sajet rests with Lonnie G. Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum are expected to raise material costs for home builders, car manufacturers, and can makers. These companies may pass the higher costs on to consumers, leading to increased prices. The tariffs could also impact international trade relationships. The policy's effect on the economy is being closely monitored.</p>

          <h2>Germany Seeks Easier Process to Declare Countries Safe for Asylum</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government is pursuing a simpler process to designate countries as safe for asylum seekers, aiming to reduce asylum applications. The new policy would allow a country to be declared safe with a simple statutory order, without requiring approval from the Bundesrat. This move is part of a broader effort by the conservative-led coalition to tighten asylum policies. Opposition lawmakers and NGOs have criticized the draft, arguing it contradicts German law.</p>
