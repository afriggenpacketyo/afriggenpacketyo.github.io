          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 17:02:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a more positive public perception of investing in stocks and shares to help stimulate the nation's economy. In a speech to financial leaders, she argued the current narrative focuses too heavily on risks, preventing savers from contributing to and benefiting from economic growth. The government plans to work with regulators to introduce new support systems for potential investors, aiming to shift funds from cash savings accounts into UK companies as part of a broader strategy to ignite growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on a White House request to rescind $9.4 billion in previously approved funding. The proposed cuts primarily target foreign aid programs and federal funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS. The measure, which has already passed the House, faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about specific programs, such as the PEPFAR AIDS relief initiative. With a tight deadline approaching, a modified version of the bill is being considered, but this would require the House to approve the changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite designated NWA 16788, with an expected price between $2 million and $4 million. Weighing over 54 pounds, this meteorite represents a significant portion of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. The sale highlights the rarity and scientific value of such objects, which offer insights into the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are calling for a public hearing regarding the federal review of the Jeffrey Epstein case. In a letter to Chairman Jim Jordan, they requested testimony from top Justice Department and FBI officials to address the administration's conclusions, including that Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" exists. The move aims to capitalize on divisions within the Republican party, where some figures have criticized the handling of the Epstein files, arguing a public hearing is necessary to counter conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>A group of a dozen conservative House Republicans joined Democrats to defeat a key procedural vote, temporarily halting a package of cryptocurrency-related bills. The move defied both President Trump, who had strongly endorsed the legislation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson. The holdouts reportedly want the three separate crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, to be consolidated into a single package rather than voted on individually. This intra-party rebellion stalls what the White House had termed “Crypto Week,” creating a significant setback for the administration's agenda on digital assets.</p>

          <p>Following the significant box office disappointment of its latest film, "Elio," Pixar's status as a guaranteed hitmaker is being questioned. Despite the massive success of "Inside Out 2," "Elio" posted a record-low opening weekend for the studio, signaling that the Pixar brand alone may no longer be enough to draw large audiences. The article suggests that after a tumultuous creative process and script rewrites, the film's final version lacked a compelling narrative purpose. This failure could make the studio more risk-averse, potentially leading it to favor sequels over original, personal stories.</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets from a facility in Texas and jointly develop a recycling line in California. This partnership is a significant step in strengthening Apple's U.S. supply chain for critical components used in electronics like the iPhone. The deal supports broader U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth market. MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S., saw its stock climb significantly following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has ousted Joseph Tirrell, the director of the Justice Department's Departmental Ethics Office. Tirrell, a career civil servant, was responsible for advising senior department officials on ethics matters. His removal is the latest in a series of firings and departures of internal watchdog and ethics officials within the department since the new administration took office. Critics, including former DOJ employees, have expressed alarm, suggesting these moves are eliminating crucial internal oversight and accountability mechanisms within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ideal age for purchasing an annuity to secure retirement income, suggesting there is no single correct answer. While buying later in life typically yields higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations, it is not always the best strategy. Financial advisors often recommend the 60-70 age range as a balanced window, but the decision should depend on individual factors like health, risk tolerance, and overall financial portfolio. The article also discusses different types of annuities and strategies like laddering to optimize retirement funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The union representing immigration judges reports that the Trump administration has fired 17 of its members across ten states in recent days. The firings were reportedly conducted "without cause" and come as the administration intensifies its immigration enforcement efforts. The union president called the move nonsensical, arguing it will worsen the existing massive case backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases. This action occurs amid recently passed legislation intended to increase the number of immigration judges to 800 to handle the caseload, which these firings directly undermine.</p>

The judge ruled that the agency exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, issued in January, was challenged by credit industry trade groups. Consumer advocates had praised the initiative, arguing that medical debt is often a poor predictor of creditworthiness and can result from complex billing and insurance disputes rather than financial irresponsibility.</p>
