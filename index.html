          <p>In a significant policy shift, the federal government announced it will restore the status of international students whose records were abruptly terminated in a crucial database, SEVIS, which tracks their compliance with legal status requirements. This reversal comes after dozens of judges issued temporary orders directing the government to reinstate these records, highlighting concerns over the administration's intensified efforts to expel noncitizens. The move is seen as a relief for thousands of international students who faced potential deportation due to minor disciplinary records or background check issues, although it remains unclear whether all terminated records will be restored or only those of students who have sued. The government is adopting a formal policy for revoking records in the database.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, with the Department of Justice seeking the death penalty. Mangione is accused of ambushing Thompson outside a New York City hotel in December 2024, and prosecutors allege he intended to target the entire healthcare industry through lethal violence. The defense argues that the government's pursuit of the death penalty is a political stunt, while also claiming that prosecutors inadvertently eavesdropped on a private phone call between Mangione and his lawyer. The judge has requested an explanation from prosecutors regarding the alleged error and how they plan to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>A surviving roommate in the Bryan Kohberger case reported seeing Xana Kernodle on the floor shortly after witnessing a masked intruder in the home where four University of Idaho students were murdered. The roommate initially thought Kernodle was drunk, and frantically texted and called other roommates, but received no response, before calling 911 at nearly noon. Digital specialists found 'abnormal' gaps in Kohberger's device data, potentially indicating attempts to erase evidence, while a defense analyst claimed there were attempts to clean up the crime scene after the homicides. The judge ruled that the digital specialists' testimony is admissible during the trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing CBS newsmagazine “60 Minutes” is facing a crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited interference from Paramount Global due to a lawsuit from President Trump and a pending merger with Skydance Media. Trump's lawsuit alleges deceptive editing in a 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, creating pressure on Paramount to settle and appease the administration. The staff fears that any willingness to placate the president could undermine the program's independence and aggressive coverage of the Trump White House. While Owens' exit may not immediately change the program's journalistic values, uncertainty over corporate support could hinder its ability to cover the Trump administration aggressively.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon reportedly set up a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office that allowed him to access messages on the encrypted messaging app Signal, bypassing standard security protocols. This system, involving a computer monitor with remote access to Hegseth's personal cellphone, raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Hegseth is already facing criticism for sharing details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group, prompting scrutiny over his handling of sensitive information. A Defense Department spokesperson denied there's a 'dirty line,' and denied there is currently any use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.</p>

Maresca emphasizes that Palmer's style, the manager, and the club remain unchanged, and expresses confidence that he will soon resume scoring, citing consistent chances in each game.

Legal scholars and former employees argue that selling the nonprofit's control of OpenAI would violate its fiduciary duty to its beneficiaries, as this control is invaluable for guiding AI development safely. They claim that the proposed move is illegal and that attorneys general should intervene, arguing that a fully commercial company is unlikely to pursue OpenAI's original mission. The concern centers around maintaining accountability for ensuring AI's safe and beneficial development, rather than prioritizing shareholder value.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. birth rate near a record low, the Trump administration is considering a $5,000 'baby bonus' to incentivize Americans to have more children. However, experts question the effectiveness of such a one-time payment, citing the high cost of raising a child and the mixed results of similar policies in other countries. Addressing long-standing economic issues like affordable day care and paid parental leave may be more effective in creating a hospitable environment for families. The declining birth rate poses long-term economic challenges, including a shrinking labor force and strains on social security systems.</p>

          <p>Hannah Dugan, the Wisconsin judge arrested for obstructing immigration enforcement, has dedicated her legal career to advocating for low-income individuals and marginalized communities. Elected in 2016, she defeated a Republican appointee and was unopposed for re-election in 2022. In 2023, she dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Republican Party of Wisconsin that argued a get-out-the-vote effort in Milwaukee violated the law. The arrest highlights the ongoing tensions between federal immigration enforcement and local officials who seek to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article explores how the proliferation of porn has shaped American culture, influencing societal views on sexuality, power dynamics, and the treatment of women. The piece argues that the mainstreaming of porn has normalized regressive behavior and cruelty, particularly in politics and media, while also reinforcing the idea that men should be catered to. It discusses the rise of social media sex worker stars and the challenges of criticizing porn in an era where sexual openness is often equated with empowerment. The author emphasizes the need for stories that affirm people’s humanity and complexity as an antidote to a porn-addled culture.</p>
