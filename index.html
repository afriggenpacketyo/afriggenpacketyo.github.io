          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $20 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Rupert Murdoch, and its parent company. The suit alleges defamation over a report about a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump claims is a fake. The lawsuit targets the publisher, reporters, and executives, accusing them of journalistic failures. Dow Jones has expressed full confidence in its reporting and intends to vigorously defend against the suit, which faces a high legal bar for public figures.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a San Francisco concert when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned. While performing her song "Roar" suspended over the audience, the prop suddenly dropped a few feet before continuing its path. Perry quickly recovered from the momentary scare and finished the song without further incident, later remarking, "Not today, Satan." The event highlights the risks artists face with complex stage mechanics, though no one was injured during the brief malfunction.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins are ongoing in Syria's Suweida Province, despite a ceasefire announced by the president. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the violence, which has seen atrocities from both sides and accusations of government forces siding against the Druze. Israel has intervened with air strikes to support the Druze community, with whom it has ties. The US-brokered ceasefire appears to be failing as gunfire and looting were reported in Suweida shortly after its announcement.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has created a commanding four-shot lead at The Open Championship, making his victory seem almost inevitable. His steady, unflappable performance at Royal Portrush has put him at 14 under par, with his closest competitor being Li Haotong. Scheffler's dominance is underscored by his history of converting 54-hole leads into wins and his pursuit of a fourth major title.

          <p>Germany is pivoting its security focus towards closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a bloc known as the "E3." This strategic shift, marked by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the US commitment to NATO under Donald Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement the US security guarantee for Europe. This alliance of necessity aims to bolster European defense independence, though complete separation from US military capabilities remains unrealistic.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona after falling out of favor at his current club. Despite a dip in form, Barcelona's interest is driven by a need to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets like Nico Williams. The loan deal presents a low-risk opportunity for the financially constrained Spanish club to acquire a talented player who, at 27, could be a major asset if he rediscovers his peak performance. For United, the move allows them to offload an unwanted player and reshape their squad.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open. Both golfers were warned by officials during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. DeChambeau described the pace in the first two rounds as "out of control," while Stenson noted the absurdity of being warned for being a few minutes behind schedule on Saturday after earlier rounds ran an hour over. The players called for a fairer, more consistent system, such as timing every shot for every player.</p>

          <p>According to Gazan hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, killing 32 people near distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The incidents occurred as people massed near the US- and Israeli-backed aid centers, which were established as an alternative to UN distribution. Witnesses reported indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated it fired only warning shots at suspects who approached their forces. The GHF, which has seen previous deadly incidents, denied any shootings occurred near its locations.</p>

          <p>Members of Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Catholic activist group, are engaging young people on the Jersey shore to promote a message of chastity before marriage. The young activists frame chastity not just as abstinence, but as a "countercultural" way to foster deeper relationships and self-worth in an age dominated by social media's superficiality. By discussing issues like the pressures of online culture and the search for authentic love, they hope to plant a seed of reconsideration among their peers. Their mission highlights a modern attempt to make a traditional message relevant to a generation facing unique social pressures.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration concerns to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing nationalist rhetoric, framing foreign tourists and workers as sources of crime and social disruption. This sentiment is fueled by a weak yen bringing record numbers of tourists and media reports on crimes committed by foreigners. While Japan faces severe labor shortages, these groups advocate for Japanese exclusivity, rejecting reliance on foreign labor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of an apartment building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation found that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, but work continued. The Public Works Minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and victims' families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>On "The Ramsey Show," a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice about her family's finances, revealing that despite a $156,000 household income, they struggle to afford groceries. She explained her husband spends up to $700 a month on tobacco and marijuana, which she described as an addiction. Host Dave Ramsey confronted the caller, stating that if her husband is truly an addict, she must treat it as a crisis and take control of the finances, rather than budgeting for his habits. The call highlighted a severe issue of financial control and addiction impacting the family's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a knee bone bruise much quicker than initially expected. The injury, sustained during a play at third base on July 2, looked severe but fortunately did not result in major ligament damage or require surgery. Muncy is already performing agility drills and has begun swinging a bat, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting his return will be "a lot sooner than anticipated." His recovery is a crucial development for the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly in his absence.</p>
