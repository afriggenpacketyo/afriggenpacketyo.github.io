          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminal justice student, pleaded guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty, instead facing four consecutive life sentences without parole plus a ten-year burglary sentence. Prosecutors presented evidence including DNA on a knife sheath, cellphone data, and surveillance video, while victims' families expressed mixed reactions to the agreement, with some seeking a full confession and others relieved to avoid a lengthy trial. The plea spares the state the cost and uncertainty of a capital case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from Insurify projects that homeowner's insurance premiums will rise in all 50 U.S. states this year, with an average increase of around 8%. States prone to natural disasters like California and Louisiana are seeing even steeper hikes, at 21% and 28% respectively, following major wildfires and storms. Experts attribute the rising costs to increased claim payouts from more severe weather events, higher home replacement costs, and the national scope of insurance companies balancing their risk. These escalating premiums are impacting the cost of living and the affordability of homeownership across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The High Court in the UK has ordered a new, independent investigation into the intelligence agency MI5 for providing false evidence to multiple courts. The ruling came after two internal inquiries were deemed "seriously deficient" by a panel of senior judges. The case originated from a BBC investigation which revealed MI5 had lied about its relationship with a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused women. The court commended the BBC for its role in exposing the misconduct and stated the new inquiry is necessary before considering contempt of court proceedings against any individuals involved.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to gather enough votes to pass the final version of a major domestic policy bill, a centerpiece of President Trump's agenda. The legislation, which passed the Senate by a narrow margin, faces opposition from both moderate and conservative GOP members over changes made in the upper chamber. Hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus are particularly concerned about the bill's increased deficit impact, while moderates worry about steeper Medicaid cuts. President Trump is actively meeting with holdouts to pressure them into supporting the bill ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has identified the cause of a fire that shut down Heathrow Airport, revealing that National Grid was warned about a critical fault seven years prior. The fire, likely caused by moisture in a transformer's insulation, led to a power outage that disrupted travel for over 200,000 passengers. The investigation found that National Grid deferred maintenance despite detecting the issue in 2018 and did not fully appreciate the substation's critical importance to the airport's operations. Heathrow is now considering legal action against National Grid for what it calls "clear and repeated failings."</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tactics to enforce party-line support for his budget bill are creating significant political fallout, potentially benefiting Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced his retirement, citing the pressure to conform, after Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against him. This dynamic could make seats in moderate states like North Carolina and Maine, held by Republican "no" voter Susan Collins, more competitive for Democrats. The Democratic National Committee now views North Carolina as a top target, hoping to capitalize on the alienation of swing voters who may prefer moderation over party loyalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When credit card issuers close an account due to prolonged non-payment, it triggers a cascade of negative financial consequences beyond late fees. The closure immediately reduces your total available credit, which can spike your credit utilization ratio and significantly lower your credit score. The outstanding debt does not disappear; it is often sold to a collection agency, leading to further negative marks on your credit report and potential legal action. To mitigate the damage, individuals should contact the creditor to negotiate a payment plan, check their credit report for accuracy, and consider professional debt relief options to start rebuilding their financial standing.</p>

The decision follows an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and painted military planes.

The legislation extends tax cuts from the first Trump administration and increases spending on defense and immigration, with offsetting cuts to programs like Medicaid being insufficient to cover the costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that an earlier House version of the bill would provide only modest economic growth, which would be outweighed by higher interest payments.

The scenes in Parliament coincided with a drop in the pound's value and a rise in government borrowing costs, with some attributing the market jitters to a loss of confidence in the government's spending control.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae pose a severe threat to livestock, wildlife, and even pets. The plan involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs subsequently fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago and is being revived as the fly migrates north from Panama.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt, debt settlement can be a viable path to financial relief, and this article outlines seven key indicators that it might be the right choice. These signs include minimum payments consuming over 20% of take-home pay, making no progress on the principal balance, and considering borrowing from retirement accounts. Other red flags are having maxed-out credit cards, resorting to cash advances to pay other bills, or accumulating debt due to unforeseen circumstances like job loss. If a traditional credit counseling plan seems unrealistically long, debt settlement can offer a faster resolution.</p>

Modern aircraft are also equipped with text-based communication systems and a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously prevents mid-air collisions. While these safety measures are robust, ATC outages can still lead to significant flight delays as traffic is limited in affected areas.</p>

          <p>Legal analysts suggest that federal prosecutors overreached in their case against Sean "Diddy" Combs, leading to his acquittal on the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. While the jury convicted him on two lesser counts of transporting for prostitution, they did not find that the government proved the existence of a complex criminal enterprise as required by the rigid RICO Act. Experts noted that RICO cases are intentionally difficult to prosecute. Combs' defense successfully argued that while his behavior was morally questionable, it did not meet the high legal standard for a criminal conspiracy, portraying the case as an overzealous prosecution.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs displayed a powerful emotional reaction in a New York courtroom after a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering and sex trafficking. Upon hearing the not guilty verdicts for these counts, the hip-hop mogul fell to his knees, burying his head in a chair at the defense table. He was convicted on lesser charges of transporting people for prostitution. After the verdict was confirmed, Combs celebrated with his family and legal team, appearing to mouth "I'm coming home" to his relatives, having been in federal jail since his arrest last September.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Rising Tensions Between Russia and Azerbaijan</h2>

          <p>Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan are escalating due to several recent events, straining a historically close partnership. Tensions have flared following the deaths of ethnic Azerbaijanis during police raids in Russia, the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines jet which Baku blamed on Moscow, and Azerbaijan's growing ties with Turkey. Azerbaijan's recent military victory in the Karabakh region has emboldened its foreign policy, while Russia's influence in the Caucasus wanes due to its focus on the war in Ukraine. These factors have led to a series of diplomatic protests and arrests of each other's citizens, signaling a significant downturn.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Hormone Therapy Combining Estrogen and Progesterone Increases Breast Cancer Risk</h2>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that the type of hormone therapy used for menopause symptoms can significantly affect breast cancer risk for women under 55. The research found that for women who still have a uterus and require a combination of estrogen and progesterone, there is a slight increase in breast cancer risk. Conversely, for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce the risk. This evolving science highlights the importance of personalized medical advice, as treatment effectiveness and risks depend on individual health factors.</p>

          <h2>Former UK Health Secretary Defends Covid-Era Care Home Policies at Inquiry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 12:27:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the UK's Covid-19 Inquiry, former Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the government's controversial policy of discharging hospital patients into care homes without testing in early 2020. He described the decision as the "least worst solution" available at the time to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed, denying that the "protective ring" promised for care homes was merely empty rhetoric. His testimony was met with criticism from lawyers representing bereaved families, who called his comments an "insult" to the thousands who died. Hancock acknowledged that the social care sector was in need of reform and feared the situation has worsened.</p>
