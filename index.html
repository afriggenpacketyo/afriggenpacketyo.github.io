          <p>NATO allies have agreed to more than double their defense spending target, moving from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, marking a significant shift in the alliance's strategy. This decision, outlined in a joint declaration, underscores the bloc's unified stance against security threats, particularly Russia and terrorism. The 5% target includes a minimum of 3.5% for core defense spending, with the remainder allocated to security and defense-related critical infrastructure. Member states will be required to submit annual plans demonstrating their progress toward achieving this goal, addressing previous concerns about some members not meeting the 2% target. This agreement comes amid heightened global tensions and aims to reinforce NATO's collective defense commitment. </p>

          <p>Health authorities are advising vigilance as the Omicron subvariant NB.1.8.1, known as "Nimbus," spreads across Europe and Asia. The ECDC recommends booster shots for at-risk groups due to declining population immunity against SARS-CoV-2. While the virus is becoming more endemic, its unpredictable mutations necessitate continued monitoring, similar to influenza and RSV. The article cites varying severity of cases in different countries, attributing it to factors like access to healthcare, timing of the variant's emergence, and vaccination rates.

          <p>The UK government plans to purchase at least 12 new US-made F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, according to an announcement by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. This move is described as the "biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation" and is a response to growing nuclear threats. While the jets can carry conventional weapons, they offer the option of equipping US-made nuclear bombs for NATO's airborne nuclear mission. The decision follows the Strategic Defence Review and a national security strategy emphasizing the need to prepare for potential direct threats to the UK homeland. The new jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. </p>

A fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran remains uncertain, and Trump's actions have made it difficult for foreign governments to trust Washington. Experts suggest that the strikes could push Iran to pursue nuclear weapons more aggressively. A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment indicates that the strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. </p>
