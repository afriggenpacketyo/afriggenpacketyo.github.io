          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) flew a banner reading "Qatar-a-Lago" over Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to protest the Trump administration's acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar and the Trump family's business dealings in the Gulf. The DNC argues that Trump is using his presidency for personal enrichment while neglecting working families. Trump defended the acceptance of the jet as a "great gesture" and claimed he would not use it after leaving office, with the White House stating the acceptance complies with the law. Trump has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest arising from his private business interests.</p>

          <p>A European court ruled that the European Union should have considered releasing text messages exchanged between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The case was brought by a New York Times journalist seeking access to the messages, which the commission initially claimed were "short-lived" and lacked important information. The court rejected this argument, emphasizing the need for credible explanations regarding why the documents could not be found.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mehmet Oz, Brooke Rollins, and Scott Turner, leading agencies overseeing welfare programs, advocate for requiring able-bodied adults to work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits. They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up, not a lifetime handout, and that work provides purpose and dignity. Referencing the success of the 1996 welfare reform, they believe work requirements will protect taxpayer dollars, empower individuals, and strengthen communities. The authors highlight that welfare dependency, not work, is the barrier and that the policy is reasonable.</p>

          <p>The United States has released additional details about its sixth-generation fighter jet, the F-47, as competition with China for air combat superiority intensifies. The F-47 will have a combat radius exceeding 1,000 nautical miles, surpassing the F-22 Raptor, and will be accompanied by collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones with a 700-nautical-mile range. These developments come as China advances its own sixth-generation fighter program, with prototypes of the Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50 undergoing test flights. The F-47 and CCA drones are expected to be critical for operations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's fast-tracked deal for a copper mine in Oak Flat, Arizona, is intensifying a conflict with the Western Apache, who consider the land sacred. The U.S. Forest Service plans to trade a portion of Oak Flat to Resolution Copper, a foreign-owned mining company, which would destroy most of the area, leaving a massive sinkhole. Apache Stronghold, supported by faith groups and tribal nations, is fighting the land swap in the Supreme Court, arguing it violates religious freedom.

He argues that providing healthcare encourages work and strengthens the economy.
