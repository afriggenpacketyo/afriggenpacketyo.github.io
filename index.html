        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Footwear maker Deckers Brands experienced a significant 15% stock decline after trimming its sales guidance for its high-performing Hoka and Ugg brands. This adjustment is largely attributed to the clear impact of tariffs and inflation on U.S. consumer discretionary spending, leading to a visible shift in purchasing behavior. Despite the CEO's confidence in the portfolio's long-term trajectory, the revised outlook signals a potential slowdown after years of strong growth for these brands, which are critical to the company's revenue. The article highlights an estimated $150 million in tariff costs this fiscal year, with only half expected to be offset through price adjustments and cost-sharing. (not investment advice)</p>

Jeffries cited Mamdani's dedication to tackling the affordability crisis and his pledge to serve all city residents. This high-profile backing strengthens Mamdani's position, who has also secured endorsements from prominent progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, alongside numerous state officials and major unions. The article also highlights that Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, recently gained the support of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for a competitive election.</p>

          <p>The United States is deploying the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean, marking a substantial escalation in its military operations against drug traffickers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the deployment, which supplements an existing presence of eight warships and a nuclear submarine. This intensified campaign has already included airstrikes, resulting in at least 43 fatalities, and has drawn criticism regarding its legality and potential political motivations to destabilize Venezuela's government. The article highlights that the carrier's advanced capabilities could enable ground strikes, a possibility President Trump has previously alluded to as the next phase of the anti-drug efforts.</p>

          <p>Denise Richards publicly challenged ex-husband Charlie Sheen's assertion that she cashed a $1 million check from him, by posting an image of the uncashed check, dated December 2011, on Instagram. Sheen had recounted on a podcast that he gave her the check as a "joke" birthday gift, only for her to cash it a month later. The article highlights their historically tumultuous relationship, which has reportedly improved, and also details Richards' current divorce proceedings from Aaron Phypers. Phypers was recently arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including spousal injury and witness dissuasion, stemming from alleged physical and emotional abuse during their marriage.</p>

          <p>A major manhunt is underway in the UK for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, a former asylum seeker convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and another woman, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu, an Ethiopian national, had been sentenced to 12 months and was slated for deportation, but instead boarded a train to London. Justice Secretary David Lammy voiced his fury over the "totally unacceptable" error, confirming Kebatu is now at large and a prison officer has been suspended pending an urgent investigation. The article highlights that the incident has ignited significant public concern and prompted calls from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for his immediate capture and deportation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, has upheld her order blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the city, rejecting the Trump administration's request to immediately lift it. Judge Karin Immergut cited the administration's prior attempts to circumvent her initial injunction and the pending review by a larger appeals court panel as justifications for her decision. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle over President Trump's authority to deploy military forces into Democratic-led cities, which has generated multiple lawsuits and conflicting court decisions nationwide. The article emphasizes Immergut's previous finding that Trump's claim of a "war-like rebellion" in Portland lacked factual basis.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed analysis of the Ronald Reagan advertisement, sponsored by Ontario, that prompted President Trump to terminate U.S.-Canada trade negotiations. The one-minute ad used direct quotes from Reagan's 1987 address on free trade, where he criticized tariffs for hurting American workers and consumers. However, the analysis reveals that the ad selectively excerpted and reordered these statements, omitting crucial context where Reagan also defended his decision to impose tariffs on Japan as a "special case."

Although the administration publicly frames it as an escalated war on drug trafficking, experts, including Dr. Christopher Sabatini, argue it's predominantly an intimidation campaign designed for regime change. The objective, they suggest, is to "strike fear" into Venezuela's military and President Nicolás Maduro's inner circle to provoke his ouster. The article details the deployment of numerous warships, fighter jets, and the CIA, alongside a $50 million reward for Maduro's arrest.

          <p>Six men have been sentenced to prison in London for a Russian-orchestrated arson attack that caused £1.3 million in damage to a Ukrainian-owned warehouse, which was used to send aid to Ukraine. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the Wagner Group—a UK-proscribed Russian terrorist organization—received a 17-year sentence for aggravated arson and a National Security Act offense. This marks the first conviction under the new National Security Act 2023, designed to combat hostile state activities. Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb characterized the incident as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" serving Russian interests, further noting Earl's additional plot to kidnap a wealthy Russian dissident.</p>

          <p>The EU is actively debating the utilization of frozen Russian central bank assets for Ukraine's war reparations, yet millions of Russian private investors face a similar predicament, unable to access their non-sanctioned securities held in European depositories. Euroclear and Clearstream severed connections with Russia's National Settlement Depository in 2022, a decision later formalized by EU sanctions. The article highlights the significant challenge for these investors, as obtaining the necessary licenses is an arduous and costly process, often surpassing the average frozen amount of €2,400 per individual. Zhanna Nemzova is advocating for a streamlined procedure and increased public awareness to assist these trapped investors, many of whom possess dual citizenship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Canada are locked in a contentious trade dispute after President Trump abruptly terminated negotiations, citing an Ontario-sponsored ad that featured Ronald Reagan's criticisms of tariffs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford initially intended to re-broadcast the ad during the World Series but later announced its discontinuation following discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump had vehemently called the ad "fraudulent," while the Reagan Foundation also criticized its use of selectively edited audio. The article contextualizes this breakdown within broader issues, including a forthcoming U.S. Supreme Court case challenging Trump's tariff authority and Canada's strategic initiatives to lessen its economic dependence on U.S. markets.

          <p>The East Wing of the White House has been entirely demolished to facilitate President Trump's controversial $300 million gilded ballroom project, a move that contradicts his previous assurances to maintain existing structures. Satellite imagery confirmed the historic section's destruction, provoking widespread outrage among historians, former White House officials, and the public. The article underscores that the demolition commenced without initial submission of plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal agency responsible for overseeing government building renovations, although officials state permits will be filed shortly. A legal challenge has emerged, with a Virginia couple filing for a temporary restraining order, asserting the construction lacks legally mandated approvals for a protected national landmark.</p>

The article highlights that the expansive 90,000-square-foot project necessitated the complete demolition of the White House's East Wing.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, informed Members of Parliament that Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins's refusal to provide expert factual evidence to that effect proved "fatal to the case." The article clarifies that proving China was an "enemy" is a crucial legal requirement for conviction under the Official Secrets Act, a standard further emphasized by a recent Court of Appeal ruling.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, slightly under the 3.1% forecast, signaling ongoing inflation with a somewhat dampened effect from President Trump's tariffs. This critical economic data, released despite a government shutdown, is essential for determining Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustments. Economists observe that while tariffs contribute to rising prices, businesses are absorbing a portion of these costs, passing on an estimated 55% to consumers. The article highlights that this persistent inflation, coupled with a decelerating job market, complicates the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, though a quarter-point rate cut at their imminent meeting is still considered highly probable.
