          <p>Members of the European Parliament denied a request for an immediate minute of silence to honor the assassinated American activist Charlie Kirk, citing procedural rules. The decision by Parliament President Roberta Metsola, which would delay a tribute until a future session, sparked protests from right-wing lawmakers who banged on their desks in disapproval. The incident has drawn accusations of hypocrisy, as critics pointed out that the parliament had previously held spontaneous tributes for other figures like George Floyd.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum, with figures like Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W.

Tributes from colleagues like Vice President JD Vance highlighted Kirk's personal relationships and influence within the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>The father of Vadim Kruglov, a Russian man killed at the Burning Man festival, has publicly appealed to President Trump for the FBI to take over the investigation into his son's death. He expressed frustration with the lack of progress from the local Pershing County Sheriff’s Department ten days after his son was found dead in what friends describe as a professional knife attack. The appeal highlights the family's quest for answers and justice in the mysterious homicide that occurred amidst tens of thousands of festival attendees.</p>

          <p>Jair Bolsonaro, the former president of Brazil, has been convicted and sentenced to over 27 years in prison for orchestrating a coup attempt to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. A panel of five Supreme Court justices found him guilty of leading a conspiracy, and the ruling also bars him from running for public office until 2033. The verdict has drawn international reactions, with US President Donald Trump calling it "surprising" and comparing it to his own legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers in England reveals a concerning trend of more children starting reception class without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. Teaching unions assert that schools are being left to "pick up the pieces" due to eroded local support services, forcing educators to spend valuable time on basic developmental support. Experts suggest that social isolation and increased screen time during formative years may be contributing factors to this decline in school readiness.</p>

          <p>A new, large-scale immigration holding facility near Fort Bliss, Texas, has been described by Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar as a "giant tent city" with a capacity for 5,000 people.

While some tracks are praised for their intimacy and adventurousness, the review suggests the album often plays it safe, catering to streaming algorithms rather than fully embracing new cultural textures.</p>

          <p>This opinion article, authored by a personal friend of Charlie Kirk, mourns his assassination as a devastating loss for both the nation and the practice of civil discourse. The author characterizes Kirk's death as a martyrdom for the First Amendment, occurring at a time when the acceptance of political violence is disturbingly on the rise. The piece urges readers to honor Kirk's legacy by recommitting to free speech and the Judeo-Christian values he advocated, warning that a society resorting to violence cannot sustain itself.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted that Spirit Airlines will go out of business, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier business model is fundamentally broken. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that a model based on low base fares supplemented by numerous fees is one that "customers hate" and is ultimately unsustainable. His sharp critique comes as Spirit recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, struggling with weak consumer demand and high operational costs.</p>

          <p>The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife has issued a public warning regarding the northward spread of the invasive hammerhead worm. This toxic pest poses a significant threat to local ecosystems as it preys on essential earthworms and can disrupt native plant growth. Officials strongly advise the public not to squish or cut the worms, as this method of disposal causes them to multiply; instead, they should be captured and either frozen or drowned in soapy water.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course in 2024, had his opening statement terminated by the presiding judge for veering off-topic.

Prosecutors allege that Routh carefully plotted the attack, and testimony has begun from witnesses, including the Secret Service agent who initially thwarted the attempt.</p>

Cramer asserted that despite geopolitical tensions and national debt, individual stocks can thrive and that bearish investors must adapt or risk further losses for their clients.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has severely undermined the long-standing security arrangements between the U.S. and its Persian Gulf allies. The attack on the capital of a nation that hosts a major U.S. military base has caused Gulf leaders to question the value of American protection, especially since the U.S. reportedly provided only a 10-minute warning. This incident erodes trust and complicates the U.S.-led anti-Iran coalition, as Gulf states increasingly view Israel as an equally destabilizing regional force.</p>

This revision comes after an unusually quiet period during the season's typical peak, which has been attributed to atmospheric conditions like dry air and disruptive wind shear. Despite the lower overall storm count, the forecast for the number of storms making a direct impact on the U.S. remains unchanged at three to six.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has prompted a close examination of the security protocols in place at his outdoor event at Utah Valley University. Although both local police and Kirk's private security team were present, the open-air venue and the shooter's rooftop position created significant security challenges. Experts in the field note that controlling access and monitoring all potential vantage points is exceptionally difficult in such settings, where standard indoor security measures like magnetometers are not typically employed.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump and other conservatives are irresponsibly and inaccurately portraying political violence as an exclusively left-wing issue in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author cites data indicating that far-right extremists have been the most frequent perpetrators of domestic terrorism in the United States in recent decades. The piece contends that Trump's own rhetoric, including his incitement of the January 6th Capitol attack, has fueled violence, a context his current narrative conveniently ignores for political gain.</p>
