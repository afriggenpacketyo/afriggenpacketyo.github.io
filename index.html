          <p>Oregon's Attorney General Dan Rayfield has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the deployment of 200 National Guard members to Portland, authorized by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The state contends President Trump lacks authority to federalize the Guard for what it deems a political move, not a public safety imperative. Governor Tina Kotek asserts local officials are capable of maintaining order, arguing the federal intervention undermines safety. This legal action reflects broader state-federal disputes over federal law enforcement presence and jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>The Senate is back in session with only two days left to fund the government, facing an increased likelihood of a shutdown due to a political impasse. Democrats and Republicans are blaming each other for the stalemate, as a GOP-led House resolution failed in the Senate and a Democratic counter-proposal also lacked support. Democrats are pushing for health insurance subsidies and Medicaid rollbacks as part of their demands, while Republicans insist on a "clean" funding bill. A meeting between congressional leaders and President Trump on Monday yielded little progress, leaving federal agencies and employees in uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has seized a record one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025, an amount estimated to be worth $11.34 billion to cartels. This massive haul, enough for 378 million lethal doses, significantly disrupts transnational criminal organizations operating in the transit zone between South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The effort, which also includes the U.S. Coast Guard, underscores intensified counter-narcotics strategies by the Trump administration. Officials emphasize that these disruptions are crucial for saving lives and protecting the homeland.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina dissolved his government following days of deadly protests that have claimed at least 22 lives, according to the United Nations. The unrest, primarily driven by young demonstrators, stems from chronic electricity and water shortages, coupled with widespread poverty affecting three-quarters of the population. Rajoelina, who was reelected in a boycotted 2023 vote, acknowledged public anger and apologized for government shortcomings, though he gave no indication of stepping down. Protesters, many identifying as "Gen Z" and using a pirate flag symbol, are demanding better living conditions and the president's resignation.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Javice was found guilty of overstating Frank's customer base, claiming five million students when the actual number was fewer than 300,000, leading JPMorgan to acquire the company for $175 million. During her emotional statement, Javice expressed remorse for her actions, but Judge Alvin Hellerstein emphasized the need for deterrence. In addition to the prison term, she faces $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to the bank, highlighting the severe consequences of financial deception.</p>

          <p>California and several other Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration, alleging it illegally cut hundreds of millions in federal security and disaster relief funding. The lawsuit claims these cuts are punitive measures against states unwilling to enforce federal immigration laws or maintain "sanctuary" policies. Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the move as an unlawful attempt to coerce states, undermining their sovereign right to allocate law enforcement resources. This action follows recent federal court rulings against the administration's attempts to condition similar grants on immigration cooperation, indicating a persistent legal battle over state and federal authority.</p>

          <p>As a government shutdown looms on October 1, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed pay or potential layoffs, but members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries. This is due to constitutional provisions and federal law that treat congressional pay as a permanent appropriation, unaffected by annual funding impasses. Most lawmakers earn $174,000 annually, a rate unchanged since 2009. In contrast, other federal employees, whether deemed essential or furloughed, will have their paychecks delayed until funding is restored, with federal contractors not guaranteed back pay.</p>

          <p>A looming government shutdown on October 1 will force active-duty U.S. military personnel and deployed National Guard members to continue serving without immediate pay.

Although a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees post-shutdown, military members require separate legislation, like the "Pay Our Military Act," to ensure timely payments.

Essential services, such as some defense and homeland security functions, continue, but many public services, from national parks to customer service interactions, could be disrupted.

The piece argues that while the presidency is powerful, it is not all-powerful, and Trump's efforts to use state power for intimidation face resistance from economic forces and legal realities. This strategy, aiming to turn a countercultural rebellion into state-sponsored submission, appears beyond his grasp.</p>

          <p>New West Ham manager Nuno Espirito Santo has declared that fostering closer ties between the club's fans and players is his "main priority" following a 1-1 draw against Everton. In his first game in charge, Nuno acknowledged fan protests and chants of "sack the board," but after Jarrod Bowen's equalizer, he led his players to acknowledge the traveling supporters. The former Tottenham and Nottingham Forest boss emphasized the need for the team to "deliver" on the pitch to earn fan appreciation. Nuno stated his approach involves incremental improvements rather than drastic tactical changes, aiming to embrace the challenge ahead.</p>

The author criticizes the lack of a clear stated purpose, speculating it could be a "loyalty check," a personnel shake-up, or a war footing announcement. The piece suggests Hegseth might be prioritizing bureaucratic power and optics over operational necessity, potentially undermining military effectiveness.

          <p>Matthew McConaughey shared that he maintained an eight-year period of secrecy from his mother, Kay, during their weekly phone calls due to her tendency to share personal information with the media. This "hiatus" began after Kay gave a media tour of his childhood home without his consent, driven by her pride. McConaughey explained that he couldn't trust her with substantive details during his rise to fame. The actor eventually lifted the restrictions once he felt more stable in his public life, now allowing his mom to "say whatever the hell she wants." The two are set to co-star in the upcoming film "The Lost Bus."</p>

The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, hostage exchanges, and a phased Israeli withdrawal, explicitly excluding Hamas from any governance role.
