            <p>The UK government is reportedly considering purchasing coking coal to sustain steel production at British Steel in Scunthorpe, following warnings that raw materials are dwindling. Sources indicate the government will formalize the offer to British Steel's Chinese owner, Jingye, to prevent a plant shutdown within weeks. Jingye has expressed concerns about the financial sustainability of the furnaces, prompting ongoing talks with government officials and unions who are urging nationalization as a potential solution. The government's offer aims to buy time for negotiations regarding the plant's future and explore alternative commercial partners to take over operations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A hearing for Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 killings of four University of Idaho students, addressed several evidentiary issues, including the admissibility of Amazon purchase data, roommate testimony, and a 911 call. The defense sought to limit the use of Kohberger's online shopping data, while prosecutors aimed to introduce testimony from a surviving roommate who claims to have seen a masked man. The judge ruled that the click data was admissible and gave guidance on the 911 call but deferred rulings on other matters. Jury selection is scheduled to begin July 30, with the trial commencing August 11.</p>

            <p>President Trump abruptly paused his "reciprocal" tariffs for most nations, excluding China, after days of promoting the trade action. He attributed the change to concerns about market volatility, stating that "people were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid." Trump noted unease in the bond market and emphasized the need for flexibility, despite previously insisting the tariffs were here to stay. The pause, communicated via social media, led to a market surge, while the White House framed the reversal as a strategic negotiating tactic.</p>

It specifically targets California's cap-and-trade program and efforts to transition to electric vehicles, asserting federal power over states' rights.

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that he anticipates a U.S. recession as a likely outcome due to President Trump's tariffs disrupting financial markets. Dimon cited rising recession fears on Wall Street, fueled by uncertainty surrounding the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. JPMorgan economists project a 0.3% contraction in U.S. GDP this year. Dimon encouraged the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to mitigate potential market reactions, cautioning that the situation could worsen without progress. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo, issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for fiscal 2026 and lowered its medium-term forecast due to higher U.S. tariffs on imported beer. The company faces a 25% tariff on all imported canned beer and aluminum cans from Mexico. While the company topped Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, its outlook overshadowed its performance. Constellation also plans to reposition its portfolio by divesting mainstream wines and focusing on premium brands. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, excluding China, whose tariffs were increased to 125%. Countries that did not retaliate against U.S. tariffs will face a blanket 10% tariff until July. The White House stated that the increased tariffs on China were due to its "lack of respect" for world markets. This article provides a country-by-country breakdown of the original tariff threats and the updated rates after the pause.</p>

The park's attractions, such as Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment and Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, set a new standard for theme park experiences with detailed environmental design and advanced technology. While the park is impressive, it leans heavily into intellectual property and lacks a larger thematic concept.</p>

The election's outcome will be influenced by issues such as the economy, housing crisis, and the country's relationship with the United States under President Trump.</p>

            <p>UK scientists claim that a saliva test analyzing men's DNA may help in early detection of aggressive prostate cancers. The test identifies men born with a higher risk, allowing for targeted biopsies and MRI scans that can uncover otherwise unnoticed tumors. While the test has shown promising results in trials, it is not yet proven to save lives and will likely take years before it can be used routinely. The test looks for 130 mutations in men's DNA, each of which can increase the risk of prostate cancers developing.</p>

President Trump urged GOP holdouts to support the bill, emphasizing the importance of implementing his border security, defense, energy, and tax priorities.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to pause tariffs was primarily driven by concerns in the bond market, where yields on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose sharply, potentially increasing borrowing costs for Americans. This followed the imposition of tariffs, which initially caused bond prices to rise as equities sold off. However, both equities and bonds then declined, prompting the White House to reverse course. The move was rewarded with a rally in equity markets and US Treasuries, while Goldman Sachs trimmed its forecast of a US recession. (not investment advice)</p>
