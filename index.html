          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, repeatedly refused to disclose the source of a "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a CNBC interview, Pulte deflected questions about the origin of the information, stating it would be reckless to reveal sources and methods. The accusations, which Cook denies, have been referred to the Department of Justice and prompted President Trump to move to fire her, creating perceptions of political weaponization of the agency amid Trump's calls for lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to host a dinner for approximately two dozen leading tech and business figures, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Sam Altman, at the renovated White House Rose Garden. The event, following a separate White House summit on artificial intelligence, highlights the administration's complex but close relationship with the technology sector. Many of the invited executives have cultivated ties with Trump, aligning with his administration's objectives on emerging technologies and domestic manufacturing. Notably absent from the initial invitation list was Elon Musk, who later stated he was invited but unable to attend.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The District of Columbia's attorney general has sued the Trump administration, alleging that the deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in the city constitutes an unconstitutional "involuntary military occupation." The lawsuit argues that President Trump has overstepped his authority and violated the principle of separating military from domestic policing. This legal challenge follows a similar one in California and comes as the administration claims the deployment has successfully reduced crime, signaling potential plans to expand the practice to other major U.S. cities despite local objections.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed false claims about vaccines, agreeing with a new appointee that mRNA shots pose a dangerous risk. Kennedy defended sweeping changes to immunization policy, including canceling mRNA funding and overhauling the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which he claimed removed conflicts of interest. His testimony follows the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who accused Kennedy of deliberately weakening the nation's public health system and vaccine protections amid widespread criticism from the medical community.</p>

The deal aligns with a recent executive order by President Trump encouraging greater access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans. (not investment advice)</p>

Former Letcher County Sheriff Shawn "Mickey" Stines is accused of shooting Judge Kevin Mullins in his chambers, with video showing a private meeting before the incident. Stines' attorney has stated that the sheriff was experiencing extreme paranoia and sleeplessness in the weeks prior, which was corroborated by witnesses and a mental evaluation that found him in an active state of psychosis after the shooting.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, its lowest point since last October, according to Freddie Mac. This continued decline in borrowing costs provides potential relief for homebuyers by increasing their purchasing power. The trend is largely influenced by growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark short-term interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed's actions do not directly set mortgage rates, they heavily influence the bond market yields that lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common perception of anxiety as a purely negative state, some psychological and philosophical viewpoints suggest it can be a powerful tool for personal growth and adventure. Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard viewed confronting one's anxiety as life's most important opportunity. Modern research indicates that moderate levels of anxiety can enhance performance and lead to "flow" states, while overcoming existential anxiety from stressful life events can foster a clearer sense of life's meaning. The key is to accept anxiety as a normal alert system and reframe it as an exciting challenge rather than suppressing it.</p>

          <p>A vascular surgeon in Cornwall, Neil Hopper, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for fraudulently claiming over £466,000 in insurance after intentionally causing injuries that led to the amputation of his own legs. The court heard that Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations, used ice and dry ice to freeze his legs, falsely attributing the damage to sepsis. The investigation also uncovered his possession of extreme pornography, including videos of body mutilation purchased from the "EunuchMaker" website, revealing a long-standing sexual interest in amputation and body dysphoria.</p>

The discount carrier is cutting unprofitable routes to reduce costs as it navigates severe financial turmoil caused by rising operational expenses and weak demand. In response to Spirit's struggles, rival airlines like United and Frontier have quickly announced new routes to capture market share, offering alternative options for travelers affected by the service cancellations.

          <p>Witnesses to the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon described a scene of chaos and horror as a carriage sped uncontrollably down a steep hill before smashing into a building. One witness heard a sound like a bomb, followed by silence and black smoke, while another in the lower carriage felt it accelerate backwards without brakes before a hard stop. People were seen jumping from the windows of the lower carriage just before the upper one careened down the tracks. The incident, which killed at least 16 people, has left the community shaken as investigations into the cause begin.</p>

          <p>The initial trailer for director Emerald Fennell's adaptation of "Wuthering Heights" suggests a highly sensual and erotic take on Emily Brontë's classic 1847 novel. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, the footage is filled with longing glances, suggestive imagery, and an overt focus on sexual tension, reminiscent of Fennell's previous film, "Saltburn." The project, which sparked a bidding war won by Warner Bros., is set for release on Valentine's Day.

Key advice includes avoiding apologies at the scene, as saying "I'm sorry" can be interpreted as an admission of guilt, potentially affecting liability claims. Instead, it is important to remain calm, ensure everyone's safety, turn off the engine, and exchange necessary contact and insurance details. Documenting the scene with photos and gathering witness information are also vital for accurately understanding and reporting the incident to authorities and insurers.</p>
