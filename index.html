          <p>The Dashixia Water Control Project in Xinjiang has officially begun storing water. As the world's tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam, its construction utilized advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, digital twins, and unmanned equipment. This innovative, 3D-printing-like approach was employed to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The project represents a new milestone in intelligent dam construction and is considered safer and more cost-effective than previous designs.</p>

          <p>Shares in Porsche and its parent company Volkswagen fell over 7% after Porsche announced delays to its electric vehicle (EV) rollout would negatively impact 2025 earnings. The company is slowing its EV push due to weakening demand, intense competition from Chinese brands, and a slowing luxury market, reducing its projected profit margin significantly. In a strategic shift, Porsche will extend the production of combustion engine models and launch some upcoming vehicles with hybrid options instead of being fully electric. (not investment advice)</p>

While not expected to make a direct landfall on the U.S., its center is passing east of Bermuda and it is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast from North Carolina to Canada. Officials in the Azores, an archipelago in the mid-Atlantic, are also monitoring the storm's progress as it tracks northeast.</p>

          <p>This analysis critiques a eulogy delivered by White House adviser Stephen Miller for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, describing it as a "battle cry" that embodies the pure ideology of the Trump administration. The author argues Miller's speech framed political opponents as pure evil destined for destruction, using Manichean rhetoric to depict a domestic political war. This approach is contrasted with Barack Obama's eulogy after the Charleston church shooting, which called for reconciliation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores Beijing's decision to halt purchases of Nvidia's B40-series chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls. The author argues that accepting these less powerful chips would be seen as conceding to U.S.-dictated technological inferiority. Instead, China is choosing to prioritize its national push for technological self-reliance and indigenous innovation, viewing dependence on U.S. hardware as no longer tenable.</p>
