          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was murdered last week, is being held at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, drawing tens of thousands of attendees. President Donald Trump and other high-profile administration officials are scheduled to speak at the event, which honors the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA. Kirk was a highly influential figure in conservative politics, particularly among young people, though his views often generated significant controversy. The organization he founded has pledged to continue its work in his memory.</p>

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory over Sam Houston State. Manning threw for 309 yards and three touchdowns, adding two more scores on the ground, a stark contrast to his struggles in previous weeks. One of his rushing touchdowns was followed by a brief taunting incident with a defender, which Manning later admitted was "a little much" but attributed to built-up frustration. Head coach Steve Sarkisian noted that Manning plays best when he is "looser and free," which was evident in his performance.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 per year by the late 2030s. While the government views the expansion as a "no-brainer for growth," the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners. Concerns about increased noise, traffic, and climate impact remain central to the debate.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in all 26 states of Brazil against legislative measures that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role in a 2023 coup attempt following his election loss. The demonstrations were sparked by a fast-tracked bill in the lower house that could grant amnesty to those convicted in the uprising. Prominent artists and cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, have joined the protests to oppose the measures.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old Iranian engineer and labor rights activist, is facing execution after her death sentence for "armed rebellion against the state" was upheld for a third time. Mohammadi, who was arrested in December 2023 for her union activities, has reportedly been tortured and held in solitary confinement. Human rights organizations and international trade unions have condemned the verdict, citing serious procedural flaws and calling it a politically motivated trial.

          <p>The mother of a freed British-Israeli hostage has condemned the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it "rewards" Hamas. Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily was held captive for 15 months, criticized the timing while hostages remain in Gaza and Hamas is still in power. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the move, stating it is intended to revive hope for a two-state solution and is not a reward for the terrorist group. The decision has been welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but strongly denounced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also mentioned Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants in the group acquiring the popular social media platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deal is being structured to address national security concerns, with plans for a U.S.-majority board and Oracle managing American user data.

          <p>McLaren's Formula 1 drivers faced a challenging weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri underperforming. Piastri, a championship contender, had an uncharacteristically error-filled weekend, crashing in both qualifying and the race. Norris managed a seventh-place finish but struggled in qualifying, which he blamed for his race result on a track where overtaking was difficult. Team principal Andrea Stella acknowledged the car was not well-suited to the Baku circuit, but also noted that Norris made a "little misjudgement" in qualifying that compromised his starting position.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration reportedly shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar." According to sources, the probe involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking future government contracts. The investigation began during the previous administration but was closed after Trump took office, raising concerns about political influence at the DOJ. The White House has dismissed the probe as "blatantly political," while the FBI Director and Deputy AG stated no credible evidence of wrongdoing was found.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, has stated that the U.S. job market is showing signs of degradation. Speaking on "Face the Nation," the IBM vice chair pointed to recent data showing a significant slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 jobs per month. He attributes this to companies cutting labor costs to protect their margins in a difficult economic environment with rising input costs. Cohn believes this trend is occurring "across the board" and was a key factor in the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The video shows the massive predators snarling, swatting, and biting at their cage doors just before being set free, highlighting their raw power. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are native to eastern Russia and northeastern China. The species is threatened by poaching and habitat loss, with conservation efforts crucial for the survival of the estimated 500-600 remaining in the wild.</p>

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000m at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final-lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but unleashed a powerful kick to surge past the field, winning in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition for "jostling." He stated after the race that he felt "robbed" in the earlier event and wanted to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the paid status of the U.S. team could create pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive $500,000 to participate, a move that contrasts with the European team, which continues to play for free. Donald speculates that if the American team underperforms, the New York audience, facing high ticket prices, might turn on them. He confirmed that his players unanimously rejected the idea of playing for money, emphasizing that their purpose and the tradition of the event are sufficient motivation.</p>

The detainees are demanding access to prescribed medications and better overall treatment at the center, which was opened by the Trump administration.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's increasing pressure on the Attorney General to prosecute his political rivals reflects his weakening political position. With declining public support amid economic concerns like rising grocery prices and stalling job growth, Trump may feel a need to consolidate power before potential electoral losses in 2026. The analysis suggests that officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi face a difficult calculation, weighing the benefits of pleasing Trump now against the future risks of potential legal consequences if his power wanes. The piece frames Trump's actions as part of a high-stakes gamble to secure his authority and impunity.</p>

Coyle, 69, previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State, where he ran a successful defense.

Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors argues that the S&P 500's high valuation is justified by the productivity gains from AI and strong corporate earnings prospects, noting "this isn't your grandfather's S&P 500." However, other analysts express caution, warning that a rate cut into a healthy economy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" that is not based on fundamentals and could end in a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. Telomeres naturally shrink with age, but persistent stress speeds up this decline, which can lead to various health problems. However, Epel notes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle." She recommends simple, sustainable practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily meditative breaks, prioritizing deep rest, and incorporating more Omega-3s into one's diet.</p>

Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and that a modern digital ID system, like one he observed in Estonia, could potentially increase citizens' freedom and access to services. The re-evaluation comes as the Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly planning to introduce a digital ID scheme. While the leadership appears open to a debate, many veteran party members remain staunchly opposed, citing concerns over civil liberties, data security, and potential misuse by the state.</p>
