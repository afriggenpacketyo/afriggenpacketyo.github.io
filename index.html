          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, is calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually assaulted her. Her brother, Sky Roberts, told the BBC that every person, regardless of their status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law. He expressed that Prince Andrew being stripped of titles and publicly shamed is not sufficient punishment. The prince has consistently denied all claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO member, after Poland, to experience such an incursion. The Romanian defence ministry stated that its fighter jets were monitoring a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure when they tracked the drone near the border. This event has heightened tensions along NATO's eastern flank, prompting Poland to increase its air defense readiness and the Czech Republic to deploy a helicopter unit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incursion as an intentional expansion of the war by Russia.</p>

          <p>This article explores how the immediate and widespread availability of high-definition smartphone footage from the assassination of Charlie Kirk is fundamentally changing how the nation confronts political violence. It contrasts the instant, raw dissemination of this event on social media with the decade-long delay before the public saw the Zapruder film of JFK's assassination. The analysis discusses the potential for desensitization and the ghoulish exercise of politically framing such tragedies in real-time, noting that the cultural gatekeepers who once controlled such imagery no longer exist.</p>

          <p>The article details a perceived increase in right-wing influence over mainstream American media outlets, particularly in television news. It points to several recent developments, including the installation of a Trump ally as an ombudsman at CBS News and a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount, which could bring CNN under a more conservative corporate umbrella. These moves, along with a settlement ensuring Fox News retains its conservative direction, are deepening concerns among media critics about the capitulation of press freedoms to right-wing political pressures.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, a state law permitting concealed firearms on college campuses is facing intense new scrutiny. The legislation is part of Utah's broader pro-gun legal framework, which includes permitless carry and lacks red-flag laws. The article explores the debate around whether such laws serve as a deterrent to violence or create unacceptable risks, especially when dealing with political extremism and grievance-driven attacks that are not swayed by rational deterrence.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford achieved a historic victory, moving up two weight classes to decisively outclass Canelo Álvarez and become the undisputed super-middleweight champion. This win makes Crawford the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three separate divisions. After the fight, Crawford asserted his place as the greatest of his era, while Álvarez offered high praise, stating that Crawford is "way better than Floyd Mayweather," whom Álvarez also fought. The performance is being hailed as a defining moment in Crawford's already stellar career.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the deportation of immigrants who have been rehabilitated after a criminal conviction. The author shares the personal story of her adopted children's birth father, who transformed his life while incarcerated in California, only to be deported to El Salvador immediately upon parole. He was then imprisoned in a notorious facility known for torture, effectively turning his completed sentence into a life sentence. The author contends that this practice is inhumane, wastes the state's investment in rehabilitation, and makes the country less safe and humane.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists have published research claiming a new artificial intelligence system for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) could reduce a submarine's chance of escape to a mere 5%. The system reportedly moves beyond traditional search patterns by integrating data from numerous sources, including sonar, radar, and ocean conditions, to create a dynamic, real-time picture of the undersea environment. This AI is designed to function as an intelligent commander, making it significantly more effective at detecting and tracking submerged vessels, posing a potential paradigm shift in naval warfare.</p>

          <p>Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico's first female president, is concluding her first year in office with approval ratings above 70%, despite facing numerous challenges. She has successfully passed major constitutional reforms, navigated delicate negotiations with U.S. President Trump, and overseen a 25% drop in homicides. While continuing the populist agenda of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Sheinbaum has distinguished herself with a more diplomatic tone and a more aggressive security strategy against cartels. However, significant economic and international pressures continue to loom over her presidency.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from a group of university scholars warns that the Colorado River's two largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could lead to a severe crisis. The researchers are urging the Trump administration to take immediate action and impose substantial water use cutbacks across the seven states that rely on the river. They argue that the gap between current water consumption and the river's actual flow poses a serious near-term threat, and waiting for states to negotiate a solution is no longer a viable option.</p>

          <p>A detailed report chronicles how a secret FBI investigation into brutality inside Los Angeles County jails ultimately led to the downfall and imprisonment of Sheriff Lee Baca. The probe, initiated by a young FBI agent named Leah Marx, uncovered a wide-ranging conspiracy by high-ranking sheriff's officials to obstruct justice by hiding an inmate informant from federal authorities. Baca's aggressive and confrontational response to the investigation, including threatening the agent with arrest, transformed a civil rights probe into a major corruption case that ended his career.</p>

          <p>A national race to redraw congressional maps is underway, spurred by President Trump's calls for Republican-led states to create more favorable districts for the GOP. Missouri's state Senate recently passed a new map designed to help Republicans flip a Democratic-held seat, following a similar, successful effort in Texas. In response, Democratic states like California are pursuing their own partisan redistricting plans to counter the Republican advantage. This wave of gerrymandering highlights the high-stakes battle for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
