          <p>In Kiruna, Sweden, a massive 113-year-old Sami-style Lutheran church, Kiruna Church, was successfully transported three miles from its original location. This extraordinary relocation is part of a multi-year project to move the entire town center, as the expanding iron-ore mine nearby has rendered the ground unstable. The complex engineering feat involved carefully driving the historic structure to its new site. This significant undertaking ensures the preservation of a cherished cultural landmark while accommodating the vital industrial operations that underpin the town's economy, showcasing innovative solutions to urban development challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and the U.S. have outlined a framework trade deal designed to lower tariffs on various sectors, including cars and pharmaceuticals, with most EU exports facing a 15% U.S. tariff. This rate is significantly lower than previously threatened by President Trump but still higher than pre-Trump levels. The agreement is expected to retroactively lower car tariffs to 15% once the EU begins legislative processes to reduce its tariffs on U.S. industrial goods. However, the lucrative European wine and spirits industry was not exempted from tariffs, causing disappointment among exporters despite ongoing commitment for future talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose 2% in July, surpassing expectations and showing a slight increase compared to the previous year. The market is experiencing its highest inventory levels since May 2020, which is beginning to ease upward pressure on prices, with the median home price increasing by only 0.2% annually. Despite two years of continuous price growth, the market may be nearing an inflection point, as wage growth now comfortably outpaces home price increases. This shift, coupled with a rise in all-cash transactions and longer selling times, suggests evolving dynamics for both buyers and sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has entered government control after insolvency courts granted a winding-up order, leaving the future of nearly 1,500 workers uncertain. Part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel, SSUK was found to be "hopelessly insolvent," owing hundreds of millions of pounds to creditors. The government has committed to covering ongoing wages and operational costs while a new buyer is sought, aiming to stabilize the critical industry. This intervention underscores the severe financial distress impacting a nationally important company, despite Liberty Steel's objections to the liquidation.</p>

          <p>Ukraine faced a massive overnight attack by Russia, involving 574 drones and 40 missiles, hitting energy infrastructure, homes, and an American electronics factory, killing one and injuring 15. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault, stating it shows Russia's lack of genuine interest in peace talks, despite recent diplomatic efforts by President Trump. Zelenskyy urged stronger international pressure, including sanctions and tariffs, as Russian forces continue to expand territory in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials, like Major Taras Berezovets, remain skeptical of Putin's trustworthiness regarding any ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. has reported a murder-free week, a development following President Donald Trump's federalization of the city's police on August 11. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced 77 more arrests by federal law enforcement agencies on Wednesday, bringing the total to 630 arrests and 86 illegal gun confiscations since the crackdown began. This controversial federal intervention, which also involved National Guard troops, aims to address the city's rising crime rates. Proponents argue local leadership has been ineffective, while critics express fury over the federalization of local policing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has permanently fired 600 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), finalizing mass layoffs initiated by Health Secretary Robert F.

This decision comes shortly after a shooting at the CDC headquarters, with a union stating the layoffs exacerbate trauma among staff.

This agreement is part of a broader U.S.-EU trade framework that sets a 15% tariff on most EU exports. In return, the EU is expected to pass legislation to reduce its tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods to zero, which will also trigger a reduction in U.S. car tariffs on EU imports.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances questions the effectiveness of wolf hunting in the Western U.S. as a tool to reduce livestock depredation. Researchers found that wolf hunting in Montana and Idaho had minimal impact on livestock losses and did not reduce the need for government-led wolf removals. The study suggests that approximately 14 wolves would need to be killed to save a single cow, indicating it may not be the most efficient solution for ranchers. The findings are timely given ongoing debates in Europe and states considering wolf hunts, emphasizing the need for effective human-wildlife conflict management.</p>

          <p>Newly released details of the EU-US trade deal reveal a closer alignment between the European Union and Washington on technology and security, a development that could strain EU-China relations. The agreement mandates the EU to purchase $40 billion worth of U.S. AI chips and to implement U.S. security standards to prevent "technology leakage" to countries like China. This commitment underscores a strategic pivot, as the EU aims to ensure sensitive semiconductors are not diverted to unauthorized entities. The move reflects a strengthened transatlantic partnership focused on safeguarding critical technological assets and maintaining global stability.</p>

The 2.5-meter bronze statue, a memorial to those lost at sea, was placed in 1954 and is a potent symbol of sacrifice from World War II. Located at a relatively shallow depth, it's the Mediterranean's most frequented dive spot. This annual, zero-impact cleaning preserves the delicate bronze, which has suffered past damage from harsher methods, ensuring the beloved monument remains accessible and intact for visitors.</p>

          <p>England captain Leah Williamson is slated to miss the commencement of the Women's Super League season for Arsenal, following a knee injury incurred during the Euro 2025 final. The 28-year-old centre-back recently underwent a successful clean-up operation for swelling in her right knee, an issue distinct from her previous ACL injury in the same leg. Williamson, who only returned to play earlier this year after a significant ten-month recovery period, will now embark on another rehabilitation phase. Her absence will undoubtedly impact Arsenal's initial league campaign, posing a challenge for the team's early performance.</p>

          <p>A report from The Economist alleges that the Trump administration has purged a senior CIA Russia analyst, who had over 20 years of experience in American intelligence. This analyst previously oversaw the 2016 report detailing Russia's interference in that year's presidential election to benefit Donald Trump. She later returned to the agency as a senior manager, supervising operations and analysis related to Russia and the former Soviet Union. The alleged removal of such a high-ranking expert raises questions about the administration's approach to intelligence and its handling of critical national security expertise.</p>

          <p>A New York appeals court has significantly reduced the civil fraud judgment against Donald Trump, his family, and his company, overturning the initial $454 million penalty as an excessive fine. While the court affirmed that Trump engaged in fraud by inflating his net worth for business advantage, it found the financial penalty unconstitutional. This ruling offers a major reprieve to Trump, sparing him from a half-billion-dollar payment, though it upholds a temporary ban on him and his sons from corporate leadership. The decision, stemming from a sharply divided appellate panel, allows for potential further appeals to the state's highest court, ensuring the legal saga continues.</p>

Trump, calling Peters a "brave and innocent Patriot," threatened "harsh measures" if she is not freed, despite her conviction for misconduct and conspiracy. Peters was found guilty of allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment and publishing materials online. Judge Matthew Barrett sentenced her to nine years, noting her defiance and lack of remorse. Peters' case has become a rallying cry among election deniers, though she cannot be pardoned by Trump as it's a state-level crime.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that home equity loans can be a strategic tool for saving money in the current high-interest rate environment, particularly for consolidating high-rate credit card debt. By converting variable-rate debt into a fixed-rate loan secured by home equity, borrowers can significantly reduce interest payments and improve cash flow. Additionally, using these loans for home improvements that increase property value can offer combined benefits of a low fixed rate, increased home equity, and potential tax deductibility on interest. However, experts caution against using home equity for luxury purchases or if it significantly reduces home equity below 20%. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, involving 3,500 apartments, is located in a crucial area linking major West Bank cities. This decision exacerbates the already dire situation for Palestinians, amid increased settler attacks and restricted movement, reinforcing Israel's intent to maintain control over the occupied territories.</p>
