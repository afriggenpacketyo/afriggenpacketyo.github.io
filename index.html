          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated a strategic shift for the national team, suggesting a greater emphasis on using long throw-ins and long-ball tactics ahead of the next World Cup. Despite a successful qualifying campaign so far, Tuchel noted that the team has used significantly fewer long balls compared to their strategy in Euro 2024. He stated that while training time is limited, such tactical elements become crucial in major tournaments. This potential change in approach reflects a pragmatic adaptation to different styles of play needed for success on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has confirmed that a drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully breached air defenses and struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat. The attack caused limited damage to the passenger terminal, including shattered windows, and resulted in one person receiving treatment for light shrapnel wounds. While most drones in the volley were intercepted, the Houthis claimed the operation was a success and warned that other sensitive Israeli targets are under threat. The incident represents a notable escalation in the long-range conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold President Trump's tariffs but acknowledged the significant financial risk if the court rules against the administration. If the tariffs are deemed illegal, the Treasury would be obligated to issue massive refunds, potentially totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion, to businesses that paid the duties. The administration is awaiting an expedited ruling from the court after a federal appeals court found the "reciprocal tariffs" exceeded presidential authority. Officials are also preparing contingency plans, such as using other legal authorities to implement similar levies. (not investment advice)</p>

She emphasized that such an order would be illegal and that the administration has not coordinated with local law enforcement, suggesting the threats are more about political posturing than a genuine effort to address crime.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Investigates Malicious Email Targeting China Trade Negotiations</h2>

          <p>American authorities are investigating a malware-laden email, disguised as a message from a Republican congressman, that targeted individuals and groups involved in U.S.-China trade talks. Cybersecurity analysts have traced the malware to a hacker group known as APT41, which is believed to have links to Chinese intelligence. The email, sent in July, asked recipients to review a piece of proposed legislation, but was designed to give hackers insight into the U.S. administration's strategies and recommendations for the contentious trade negotiations. The incident highlights ongoing cyber-espionage efforts related to sensitive economic policy.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to prioritize a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The families of the 48 remaining hostages, of whom only around 20 are believed to be alive, are increasing pressure on the government, arguing that an expanded military offensive further endangers their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli government has signaled its intent to intensify military operations to achieve what it calls a "total victory" over Hamas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he is ready to implement a "second phase" of sanctions against Russia over the ongoing war in Ukraine. While he has previously threatened such measures, this is the most direct indication that he may be preparing to escalate economic pressure on Moscow and countries purchasing its oil. The comments suggest a more aggressive U.S. posture as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stalled. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent mentioned the possibility of secondary tariffs on nations buying Russian energy, a move that could significantly impact major buyers like China and India.

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has confirmed that the government is exploring the use of additional military sites to accommodate asylum seekers as part of its plan to move them out of hotels. The Labour government aims to accelerate its strategy to end the costly use of hotels, which currently house over 32,000 individuals. This initiative is being presented as an "all of government effort" to manage the ongoing challenge of small boat crossings in the English Channel, which surpassed 30,000 for the year. Officials are also considering other non-military options, such as prefabricated buildings on industrial land.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, has strongly criticized Vice President JD Vance for his remarks supporting a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers. Vance had called the killing of cartel members the "highest and best use of our military." In response, Paul labeled Vance's sentiment as "despicable and thoughtless," warning against the glorification of executing accused individuals without a trial or due process. The exchange highlights a significant intra-party disagreement over the use of military force for law enforcement purposes and the principles of justice.</p>
