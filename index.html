          <p>A tragic shooting at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, has left one person dead and several others wounded. Law enforcement confirmed an adult man was killed, and a person of interest is now in custody, with authorities assuring the public there is no further danger. The incident, which occurred around 8 p.m. ET, initially suggested multiple suspects, but surveillance footage clarified there was only one shooter. A witness at a wedding reception nearby recounted seeing the suspect, bleeding after being struck with a chair, flee through the event. The circumstances and precise count of victims are still under investigation, highlighting the sudden violence that disrupted the private club.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several bills in Los Angeles aimed at restricting federal officers' actions, particularly regarding immigration enforcement. The "No Secret Police Act" (SB 627) bans federal and local law enforcement from wearing face coverings on duty and requires identification, effective January 1. This legislation, seen as resistance against the Trump administration's "authoritarian tendencies," also protects children from immigration operations at schools and restricts officers from non-public hospital areas without warrants. Federal officials, however, argue the state lacks jurisdiction and that such laws endanger officers, signaling a potential legal battle over state versus federal authority.</p>

          <p>Indian-controlled Kashmir faces a significant challenge with its stray dog population, leading to over 6,000 reported dog bite cases last year in Srinagar alone. Residents, like 60-year-old Feroz Ahmed, carry sticks for protection, while others have suffered severe injuries, including a 6-year-old with a permanent facial scar. In response, Srinagar's municipal authority has launched an ambitious initiative to catch and sterilize over 21,000 stray dogs by the end of 2026, using technology to ensure their release in original localities. Animal welfare activists, however, argue that proper treatment can make strays affectionate, noting that most bites come from mothers protecting newborns.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, hours after another conservative lawyer, Mary "Maggie" Cleary, was named acting U.S. attorney. This move follows the abrupt resignation of Erik Siebert, who reportedly faced pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Trump praised Halligan as "Fair, Smart, and will provide... JUSTICE FOR ALL!" and confirmed he fired Siebert for his perceived refusal to prosecute James.

He asserted that the U.S. "should have never given it up" and indicated ongoing discussions with Afghanistan for its return. This move has, however, drawn swift pushback from both China and the Taliban government. China's foreign ministry spokesman underscored respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty and warned against actions that could escalate regional tensions.

The Duchess maintains she was deceived by Epstein's lies and stands by her strong public condemnation of sexual abuse.

A 26-year-old man was subsequently released on bail in connection with the alleged threat against the singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey. While the Ottawa concert proceeded, the U.S. cancellations were made "out of an abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and the band." Morrissey, widely recognized as the former frontman of The Smiths and for his outspoken stances on issues like animal welfare and politics, has a history of controversial public actions, including a past refusal to tour Canada due to the annual seal hunt.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut to 4.00%-4.25% was met with stock market gains, but unexpectedly caused long-term rates, including mortgages, to rise. Bond traders "sold the news," interpreting the Fed's easing policy amidst above-target inflation and a steady economy as a potential neglect of inflation risks, which is detrimental to longer-duration securities. This upward movement in yields, also influenced by international trends, suggests the bond market desires more aggressive rate cuts tied to "terrible news" of an economic downturn, rather than the current "risk management" approach. This dynamic could impact costs for homes, autos, and credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian director Anuparna Roy made history at the Venice Film Festival, becoming the first Indian director to win the Orizzonti Award for new voices in independent world cinema with her debut film, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." Roy, 31, from a tribal village in West Bengal, self-funded her first short film and later secured backing for her feature, set in Mumbai. The film explores the intimate relationship between two migrant women navigating same-sex desire and survival in an urban environment. Critics praised its "anguished portrait" and "remarkable subtlety," noting Roy's authentic, observational style, which draws inspiration from her own challenging upbringing.</p>

          <p>A new MSNBC report alleges that Tom Homan, designated as Trump's border czar, was recorded by FBI agents accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover operatives posing as business contractors. The incident reportedly occurred six weeks before the 2024 election, with Homan allegedly promising to assist in securing government contracts in the border security industry during a potential second Trump term. Although federal officials reportedly believed they had a strong bribery case, the investigation stalled after Trump took office and was subsequently closed by his newly appointed Justice Department officials, who dismissed it as a "deep state" investigation.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist and Trump ally, was shot dead at 31 while speaking at a university event, prompting a national conversation about political violence. Co-founder of Turning Point USA at 18, Kirk gained a massive social media following through his combative "Prove me Wrong" debates, where he challenged liberal viewpoints. He was a vocal proponent of the MAGA movement, inspiring young conservatives and frequently defending right-wing populist ideology on issues like immigration and transgender rights. Despite accusations of racism and antisemitism, Kirk remained a fiercely loyal Trump supporter, becoming a significant, polarizing figure in American conservative politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Southwest faces a renewed threat of flash flooding this weekend, with more monsoonal moisture expected to bring isolated thunderstorms and heavy rainfall to California and Arizona.

Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen in the central Atlantic, forecast to become a hurricane and pass east of Bermuda, potentially generating dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring another tropical wave off West Africa, indicating a potential increase in Atlantic hurricane activity.</p>

He envisions a society with intelligent humanoid robots far exceeding the human population, providing products and services. While Musk's vision offers sci-fi optimism, critics question the feasibility of funding such a system, given current economic challenges and political resistance to even modest universal basic income proposals. The mechanics of taxing profitable AI companies or restructuring welfare states remain unanswered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" receives a contemporary adaptation at London's Rose Theatre, transporting the meddling heroine to a 21st-century Essex setting. Playwright Ava Pickett's version sees Emma Woodhouse navigating online dating profiles, clubbing, and a failed university stint, while still attempting to orchestrate her friends' love lives. The play explores themes of self-worth derived from dating apps and the complexities of modern communication, reflecting Pickett's own experiences as a first-generation university student. This fresh take, which also adjusts the age dynamic of Emma's love interest, aims to resonate with modern audiences by highlighting the enduring human condition amidst new technological and social landscapes.</p>

          <p>A growing number of UK students are facing significant financial hardship, with maintenance loans failing to cover basic living costs, forcing them to juggle demanding part-time jobs and long commutes. Research indicates that loans cover only about half of the minimum socially acceptable living standard, leaving students like Tianna Hunkins working 30-hour weeks, sometimes finishing at 2 AM, and even wearing uniforms to lectures. Many, like Faith Webb, opt for lengthy commutes from home to avoid rent, sacrificing social life and study time. Universities are noting the impact on academic performance and are advocating for the reintroduction of maintenance grants and increased loan amounts.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is gaining attention for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog." While traditionally known for enhancing athletic performance, emerging research suggests it may improve short-term memory, mood, and focus, especially in individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. Experts like Dr. Susan Kleiner highlight new studies considering female biology, showing creatine's impact beyond muscles to reproductive and bone health. Though not a "wonder drug," and with potential side effects like stomach upset, it offers a promising, yet still developing, avenue for cognitive enhancement, especially for those experiencing perimenopausal brain fog or sleep deprivation.</p>

Critics, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the UK's Chief Rabbi, view the move as "political posturing" or a "reward for terrorism."
