          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Advanced Infrared Technology Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have created a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect known for its ability to detect faint heat from forest fires miles away. This biomimetic technology is reportedly capable of detection speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods. Infrared sensing is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate smoke, fog, or dust. The fire beetle's unique organ evolved to find the residual heat from wildfires, which provides the ideal conditions for its larvae to hatch and thrive on charred wood.</p>

          <h2>Jane Street's Case in India Highlights Blurred Line Between Arbitrage and Market Manipulation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 01:59:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's recent action against high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the fine line between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences in different markets, while manipulation is the illegal act of deceiving or distorting markets. Experts suggest the distinction hinges on intent, or 'mens rea,' and market impact. India's regulator, SEBI, accused Jane Street of deliberately manipulating less liquid stock and futures markets to profit from larger bets in the more liquid options market, a charge the firm disputes, calling its actions basic index arbitrage.</p>

          <p>Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby legend Michael Lynagh, is set to start for Australia against the British and Irish Lions, capping a significant personal journey. At 17, while living in London, he chose to move to Australia to play for the Queensland Reds, putting his ambitions for England on hold. Despite his famous name, coaches praise his tough character and composure, noting he quickly proved himself in the demanding Australian rugby environment. This decision highlights his commitment and courage to step out of his comfort zone to pursue his own path in the sport.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, a move requested by President Trump. The package, which passed 216-213, targets approximately $8 billion for foreign assistance programs like USAID and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The vote was delayed for hours due to a procedural debate related to releasing files on Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson celebrated the passage as a win for fiscal responsibility, while critics argue it undermines America's global influence and harms vital public services.</p>

          <p>Following growing pressure from his political base, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek court approval to unseal grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move comes after the Justice Department released a memo stating it found no evidence of an Epstein "client list," which angered many of the president's supporters who believe in a wider conspiracy. Trump has attempted to manage the political fallout by defending his administration's handling of the files while also pushing for the release of what he deems "credible" information to appease his base.</p>

The letter was allegedly part of a collection compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday. President Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling it a "fake thing" and a "scam," and has threatened to sue the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch.

The report also detailed widespread cockroach and mice infestations, severe overcrowding, and prisoners being locked in cells for over 22 hours a day. Inspectors found oversight of at-risk prisoners to be "shockingly poor," a major concern given three recent suicides at the jail.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a plan to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, effectively eliminating support for NPR, PBS, and their member stations. NPR's CEO described the cut as an "irreversible loss" and an "unwarranted dismantling of beloved local civic institutions." While NPR itself receives a small portion of its budget from federal funds, many of its 1,000 member stations, particularly in rural and underserved areas, rely heavily on this support and may be forced to shut down. The move has been criticized for disregarding public support for the institutions.</p>

These actions include settling a lawsuit from Trump over a '60 Minutes' interview and the departure of the show's chief. The analysis posits that sacrificing Colbert's show could be seen as a maneuver to please the administration and ensure federal approval for Paramount's pending merger with Skydance.</p>

The suspension follows a recent interview where she reiterated controversial views on racism, distinguishing between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice like antisemitism. Abbott was previously suspended in 2023 for similar comments made in a letter. Her latest remarks have drawn criticism from senior party figures, while allies argue her comments were taken out of context, deepening the internal divisions within the party.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense and security spending. In a BBC interview, Merz stated that Europe knows it must do more for its own defense, a message he believes the Trump administration has made clear. His comments came as he visited the UK to strengthen a trilateral alliance with Britain and France, focusing on security, foreign policy, and economic growth. Merz emphasized that Russia poses a significant threat not just to Ukraine but to the entire political order of Europe.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of Congressman John Lewis's death, tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in over 1,500 marches and rallies to protest the Trump administration. The "Good Trouble Lives On" day of action, named for Lewis's famous call to action, was organized by dozens of advocacy groups. Protesters' demands included an end to the administration's crackdowns on civil rights and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and cuts to social programs. The events honored Lewis's legacy of civil disobedience and collective action to advance justice and equality.</p>

          <p>Two U.S. intelligence sources have confirmed to CBS News that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured during an Israeli attack on Iran last month. The sources corroborated Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries while escaping through an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting that was targeted. It is not yet clear if the Iranian president was intentionally targeted in the strike. The White House and the Israeli government have not commented on the report, which reveals a significant escalation during the 12-day conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, a design known as VTOL (vertical take-off and landing). This capability allows it to operate without a runway, making it flexible for deployment in rugged or remote areas. The drone, which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was recently tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. Its intelligent control system demonstrated autonomous capabilities like target allocation and threat avoidance, which are vital for controlling potential drone swarms in combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects for the first time in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI was used to create a scene of a building collapsing, completing the sequence ten times faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. He framed the technology as an opportunity to enhance creativity, especially for productions with smaller budgets. The move is notable as the use of AI in entertainment remains controversial and was a key point of contention during the 2023 Hollywood actors' strike.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common and benign vein condition. The disclosure came amid public speculation after images showed the 79-year-old president with mild swelling in his lower legs and a bruised hand. A letter from the presidential physician stated that medical tests revealed CVI but found no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The White House press secretary attributed the bruised hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, reiterating that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, calls the administration's action "arbitrary and capricious" and politically motivated, citing President Trump's personal animus toward the project. Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that will jeopardize jobs. The administration's review cited budget shortfalls and missed deadlines as justification for pulling the funds from the long-delayed infrastructure project.</p>

The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of a sacred place and innocent civilians sheltering there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement expressing deep regret, stating that "stray ammunition" had hit the church by accident and that the incident is being investigated.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems primarily from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. Trump, who appointed Powell but now calls him a "stubborn mule," has publicly pushed for immediate rate cuts to boost economic growth. The president's frustration also extends to a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. While the Fed is designed to operate independently from political pressure, Trump's vocal criticism and reported inquiries about firing Powell test the legal and political boundaries of that independence.</p>
