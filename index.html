          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, revolutionized the understanding of sexual assault by reframing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book led to significant legal reforms, including the abolishment of the corroborating witness rule and the passage of rape shield laws. While praised for its impact, Brownmiller's work also faced criticism for its generalizations about men and its perceived victim-blaming in later years.</p>

The move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's unique traditions and a display of separation from the US, especially after Trump's comments undermining Canada's sovereignty. A British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, making the King's visit a rare occasion, but it also comes at a consequential time for Canada.</p>
