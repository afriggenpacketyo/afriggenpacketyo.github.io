          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced that the government would seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the legality of migrant turnbacks at the border. This decision follows a Berlin court ruling that deemed the refusal to allow three Somali nationals entry unlawful. Dobrindt insisted on the necessity of cracking down on illegal migration to prevent the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from gaining further traction. Germany introduced stricter border checks in May, leading to denied entry for asylum seekers and other migrants.</p>
