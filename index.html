        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Indira Gandhi's government considered shifting India from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, this proposal aimed to centralize executive power and sideline the judiciary. Although the plan never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. After Gandhi's defeat in 1977, subsequent amendments rolled back these authoritarian provisions, but the idea resurfaced in 1982, underscoring the enduring tension between centralized power and democratic checks and balances in India.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw pitched five strong innings, allowing only one run, to lead the Dodgers to a 7-3 win over the Cardinals. The victory broke a two-game losing streak and ended a period of struggles for the team. Kershaw's performance was especially important given recent injuries to the Dodgers' pitching rotation. The Dodgers' offense also contributed, scoring seven runs, their highest total this month, providing Kershaw with much-needed support, while downplaying the importance of the upcoming series against the Padres.</p>
