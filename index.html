          <h2>Republicans Propose Senior Tax Deduction as Alternative to Social Security Tax Elimination</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proposing a temporary $4,000 tax deduction for adults aged 65 and over as part of their tax bill, which they are calling a 'bonus'. This is an alternative to President Trump's idea of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The deduction, applicable from 2025 to 2028, would phase out for single filers earning above $75,000 and married couples filing jointly above $150,000. While not as generous as a tax credit, this deduction would reduce the amount of seniors' income subject to taxes, potentially cutting taxes by a little less than $500 per year for a median income retiree.

          <p>A Buddhist monk in Thailand has been arrested for allegedly embezzling over $9 million from Wat Rai Khing, a prominent temple funded by devotee donations. Abbot Phra Thammachiranuwat is accused of transferring the temple's funds into his personal account, with investigators tracing some of the money to an illegal online gambling network. The arrest has sparked outrage on social media, with some users questioning the integrity of temples, while others caution against generalizing all monks as corrupt. Authorities have arrested a second suspect and are investigating whether others were involved, while local media reported the abbot has now left the monkhood.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite is now unavailable on iOS devices globally after Apple blocked their attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store. This action follows a judge's ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps. Epic Games had submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store a month after the ruling, but Apple's decision effectively keeps Fortnite offline for iOS users worldwide until the dispute is resolved.

          <p>US military commanders will be directed to identify transgender troops or those with gender dysphoria and subject them to medical checks, potentially leading to their removal from service. This new process aims to fulfill Donald Trump's directive to remove transgender service members from the military, despite their years of service. The policy relies on annual health checks, with commanders able to expedite assessments if aware of a service member's gender dysphoria. The department is offering financial incentives for voluntary departures, but some view this as not genuinely voluntary, as the policy does not grandfather in currently serving transgender troops and allows only limited waivers.</p>

          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is a complex and costly endeavor due to the intricacies of the global automotive supply chain. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. sourcing, experts say it's not feasible, with 15% to 20% of commoditized parts currently impossible to source domestically. Increased costs for raw materials, manufacturing, and establishing new plants would significantly raise vehicle prices, potentially pricing consumers out of the market. While tax breaks or consumer incentives could ease the burden, experts estimate that a fully U.S.-made vehicle could cost thousands of dollars more, and take a decade or more to achieve.</p>

          <h2>Tech Leaders Predict AI Will Soon Match Human Brains, Sparking Debate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tech industry leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic are predicting the imminent arrival of artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.), an AI that matches human-level intelligence. However, many scientists disagree, arguing that current technologies are insufficient and lack key elements like the ability to recognize irony or feel empathy. Skeptics emphasize that today's AI systems primarily predict the next likely word or pixel, differing significantly from human cognition. The debate highlights the challenges in defining human intelligence and the limitations of current benchmark tests in capturing the full scope of human capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East trip resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, including deals for Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced chips for AI development. These deals, negotiated by Trump's AI advisors, have raised security concerns, as they overturn limits imposed by the Biden administration over fears the technology could reach China. Shares in Nvidia and AMD have soared following the announcements, but some Trump officials are already considering how to pause the deals. The State Department is also pushing back against the European Union’s digital content laws.</p>

While Latvia is a NATO member, concerns about Russia's intentions remain, especially given Trump's questioning of the U.S. commitment to the alliance.

Abrego Garcia's legal team accuses the administration of stonewalling court-ordered fact-finding as they seek his release. The administration has invoked the state secrets privilege, claiming Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, while his lawyers argue he has never been charged with any crimes. The Justice Department argues it does not have constructive custody over detainees in El Salvador due to a financial agreement.</p>
