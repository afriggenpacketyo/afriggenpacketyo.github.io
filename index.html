            <p>Two individuals tragically lost their lives in Moore, Oklahoma, after their vehicles were swept away by floodwaters resulting from intense rainfall. Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child outside one of the submerged vehicles. The incident occurred as over 30 million Americans faced severe weather alerts this Easter weekend, with numerous states in the Heartland already experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds. The flooding caused significant road closures and high-water incidents across the city, prompting officials to urge residents to stay home if possible.</p>

            <p>While tongue scraping is increasingly popular for dental hygiene, some experts warn of potential heart health risks. Dr. Bradley Serwer notes the strong link between oral hygiene and heart health, cautioning that tongue scraping can cause microscopic cuts, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis. Dr. Whitney White advises gentle, infrequent scraping to avoid disrupting the balance of beneficial microbes that produce nitric oxide, essential for heart health. Experts emphasize that tongue scraping should not replace regular brushing and flossing for maintaining healthy gums and teeth.</p>

            <p>In Texas and Northern Mexico, the tradition of cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, connects generations during Easter. Denise Solis continues the tradition started by her mother, who made cascarones even during her final weeks battling cancer. The act of filling and breaking the eggs symbolizes rebirth and renewal, aligning with the Easter holiday's themes. For Solis, making cascarones with her son is a powerful way to remember her mother and pass on the love and joy associated with the tradition.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more assertive diplomatic stance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-Rwanda conflict, a rare departure from its usual non-interference policy in African affairs. Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has directly called on Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. This shift reflects China's efforts to safeguard its significant mining interests and maintain positive relations with both countries, balancing its economic priorities with its diplomatic approach.</p>

            <p>DHL Express has temporarily suspended deliveries to the US for shipments worth over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The delivery giant cited a surge in formal customs clearances, causing multi-day delays for shipments exceeding the threshold. The White House is also set to crack down on deliveries under $800, particularly those from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu, who have warned of potential price increases. The measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain, according to the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>Five international students from India and China are suing the Department of Homeland Security over the termination of their F-1 visas. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, claims the Trump administration unilaterally terminated the visas of numerous international students, causing financial and academic hardship. The students argue they were not given proper notice before their legal status was revoked, potentially jeopardizing their degrees and research. This action has sparked widespread concern among international students, universities, and advocacy groups, as Chinese and Indian students comprise a significant portion of the international student population in the United States.</p>

            <p>The increasing popularity of snail slime in beauty products raises ethical concerns about the treatment of snails. While the industry claims snails are treated well, the slime is often extracted through methods that induce stress, such as acidic solutions or physical force. Animal welfare organizations argue that snails can feel stress, pain, and fear, urging consumers to consider the ethical implications of using snail-derived products. The author questions the normalization of industrializing snail labor for uncertain beauty benefits.</p>

            <p>This reflective piece laments the loss of a certain openness and charm once associated with America, contrasting it with current border anxieties and political divisions. The author recalls a time of easy border crossings and a sense of limitless possibility, now replaced by stringent security and a feeling of closed doors. The essay explores the concept of America as a land of "bubbles," both real and fantastical, and how those bubbles are being threatened by authoritarianism and careerism.</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian exports to China have increased due to consistent supply and enhanced logistics, with naturally ripened fruit being well-received by Chinese consumers. Malaysian suppliers expect a 30% increase in durian exports to China this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree, which is favored by Chinese consumers.</p>
