        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, marking an 86% increase from March and more than double the amount from a year prior, largely due to President Trump's trade war policies. These increased customs duties have contributed to a surplus of $258.4 billion for the month, up 23% from the previous year, thereby reducing the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.05 trillion. Despite the surplus, high interest rates on the national debt continue to pose a significant budgetary challenge, with net interest totaling $89 billion for April. This article highlights how trade policies are impacting government finances amid broader economic challenges.</p>

          <p>A US-funded flight carrying 59 white South Africans, granted refugee status, landed near Washington DC, sparking debate over expedited processing due to claims of "racial discrimination." President Trump asserted a "genocide" targeting white farmers, claims South African President Ramaphosa refuted. Critics like Senator Shaheen and lawyer Melissa Keaney decry the fast-track initiative as hypocritical given suspended refugee admissions from war-torn countries. This article underscores the strained US-South Africa relations, exacerbated by land reform policies and accusations of "race-baiting."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent trade agreements with China and the United Kingdom, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. remains at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. This high tariff rate, equivalent to a 15.4 percentage point increase since before Trump's second term, is expected to cost the average household $2,800 in the short run. While the China trade deal led to a reduction in duties from 145% to 30%, the deal with the U.K. had minimal impact on overall tariff rates. This article suggests that consumers and businesses will likely adjust their purchasing behavior to mitigate the higher costs associated with these tariffs.</p>

          <p>Coinbase shares surged 8% after the announcement that the cryptocurrency exchange will join the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial Services, effective May 19. This move reflects Coinbase's growing significance in the U.S. financial system, driven by bitcoin's rising value and the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. While Coinbase's stock has been volatile since its 2021 direct listing, its inclusion in the S&P 500 is expected to increase its value as funds tracking the index add it to their portfolios. The article also mentions Coinbase's recent plans to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, for $2.9 billion.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved three new natural food colorings: Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, for use in various foods and drinks. These dyes are considered safer alternatives to synthetic dyes, which some limited research has linked to behavioral issues in children. Experts indicate that these additives are generally safe, especially in small amounts; however, some adults with kidney stones may want to limit their consumption of products containing calcium phosphate. The article notes that these new approvals will provide food manufacturers with more options for switching from artificial to natural dyes, though natural colors can be more expensive and may fade more easily.</p>

          <p>This article examines Pam Bondi's tenure as Attorney General, highlighting her close alignment with President Trump's agenda and the White House's significant influence over the Justice Department. Bondi's actions, such as prioritizing the release of the "Epstein Files" and assisting Elon Musk, have drawn criticism from both the left and right. The article suggests that Bondi's role is more of a surrogate, executing White House directives rather than asserting institutional independence, contrasting with her predecessors. Her close coordination with Trump's team, including Stephen Miller, has led to a redefinition of criminality and a shift in the department's priorities.</p>

The prime minister's focus on legal and illegal migration precedes an anticipated deal with the EU, including a youth mobility plan, highlighting the crucial need for a sustained downward trend in net migration numbers to maintain credibility.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have outlined a tax bill that would temporarily enact President Trumpâ€™s campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, roll back subsidies for clean energy, and create a new tax-advantaged investment account for children. The bill includes extending provisions from Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax law, raising the state and local tax deduction limit to $30,000, and new tax breaks. To offset the costs, the legislation ends some clean-energy tax credits and raises taxes on university endowments. The article highlights the challenges in passing the bill, given expected Democratic opposition and criticism from some House Republicans.</p>
