          <p>S&P Global has announced that advertising technology firm AppLovin and stock trading platform Robinhood Markets will be added to the S&P 500 index. This inclusion, effective before trading begins on September 22, prompted shares of both companies to rise significantly in extended trading. The move is consequential as index funds that track the S&P 500 will now be required to purchase their stocks. AppLovin and Robinhood, both of which went public in 2021, will replace MarketAxess Holdings and Caesars Entertainment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's biotechnology industry has been rapidly advancing, increasingly challenging the United States' long-held dominance in the sector. This growth is partly attributed to significant regulatory reforms initiated in 2015 that shifted the country's focus from generic drugs to fostering genuine innovation. The article examines whether recent U.S. tariffs can effectively slow this momentum, especially as China's clinical data gains more acceptance from international bodies like the FDA. This situation highlights the escalating economic and technological competition between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

The complaint raised concerns about potential risks the chatbot posed to young users.

Her comments come amid President Trump's attempts to remove her from her FTC position, a move she is currently challenging in court.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report for August has raised alarms among economists, revealing a meager addition of only 22,000 nonfarm jobs while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Key takeaways from the data indicate a clear stalling of the job market, with sectors like manufacturing shedding jobs, and the weakest eight-month job growth in 15 years, excluding the pandemic. This poor performance has solidified expectations that the Federal Reserve will implement an interest rate cut later this month to stimulate the faltering economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, under new leadership appointed by President Trump, is taking steps to vacate a rule that would have banned noncompete employment agreements nationwide. The original ban, finalized in 2024 but halted by a federal judge, was a signature policy of the previous administration. The new FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, described the rule as an overreach of authority but stated the agency will instead pursue enforcement actions against specific abusive noncompete agreements. This policy reversal marks a significant shift in labor market regulation.</p>

The administration claims the change aims to project strength and restore a "warrior ethos," with the new name initially serving as a secondary title pending congressional approval. The move has drawn criticism from opponents who cite the potentially high cost of the rebrand and argue that the nation's focus should be on preventing wars, not promoting them.

Having managed only four games, Tuchel has had limited opportunity to implement his vision, a situation partly of his own making by delaying his start date. While statistics show some positive signs, such as increased possession and more aggressive pressing, the team's overall performance has not yet demonstrated a clear departure from the previous era.

While President Trump has described the city as a "murder capital," data from the FBI and the Chicago Police Department show that overall violent crime has been falling and is lower than in several other major U.S. cities. Although Chicago recorded the highest total number of homicides last year, its homicide rate per capita was not the highest among large cities.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written exchange with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that her direct response was merited by Jackson's own "spirited argument" in her dissent, emphasizing that the debate was about legal ideas, not personal animosity. She stated that she has "great respect" for Justice Jackson and that vigorous disagreements on paper do not prevent the justices from maintaining collegial and friendly relationships off the bench.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a pause on the country's electric vehicle mandate that required 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026. The move comes as Canada's economy shows signs of weakening and is part of a broader strategy to support domestic industries, which includes a new "Buy Canadian" policy for federal contracts. The government cited the need to manage the impact of U.S. tariffs on the auto sector as a reason for the policy shift, though longer-term EV sales targets for 2030 and 2035 will remain in place.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. authorities have arrested two 17-year-olds in connection with the June murder of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern who was an innocent bystander struck by stray bullets. The teenage suspects are being charged as adults with first-degree murder while armed. This specific crime was previously cited by President Trump as a justification for deploying National Guard troops to the capital as part of a broader federal law enforcement intervention. Police are reportedly searching for a third suspect involved in the shooting.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion in a single week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. This surge was driven by several key events, including a court ruling in Google's antitrust case that was less severe than feared, which boosted both Alphabet and Apple. Additionally, Broadcom's stock soared after announcing a major new AI chip customer, and Tesla's value rose following a proposal for a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk, underscoring the sector's immense market power.

          <h2>Weak Jobs Report Increases Likelihood of Lower Mortgage Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The disappointing August jobs report, which showed slower hiring and a rise in unemployment, could lead to a further decline in mortgage rates. Because the Federal Reserve often cuts interest rates to stimulate a weakening economy, this new data increases the probability of a rate reduction at the central bank's next meeting. Lenders have already begun pricing in this expectation, contributing to recent drops in mortgage rates. The weak employment figures may now prompt the Fed to consider a larger cut, which would likely push mortgage and refinancing rates even lower. (not investment advice)</p>

He has stated he was suffering from depression and the effects of psychedelic mushrooms, believing he was in a dream. As part of a plea agreement, he is also expected to plead no-contest to 83 state charges of reckless endangerment.</p>

          <p>In a speech at the National Conservatism Conference, Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt presented a vision of America as a homeland specifically for the descendants of white European Christian settlers. This article argues that his remarks, which claimed the nation "belongs to us" as a "birthright," represent a direct rejection of the foundational American principle that "all men are created equal." The speech is framed as an embrace of blood-and-soil nationalism, defining American identity by race and heritage rather than by shared civic ideals or citizenship.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a major reshuffle of his cabinet following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Rayner stepped down after an ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code regarding a property sale. In the shake-up, David Lammy has been appointed as the new deputy prime minister, and Shabana Mahmood becomes the new home secretary. This restructuring, the largest of Starmer's time in power, places women in three of the four great offices of state for the first time in UK history.</p>
