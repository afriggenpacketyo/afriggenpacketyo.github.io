          <h2>Russia's War Economy Faces Challenges That Could Push Moscow to Negotiate</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite showing little interest in peace talks with Ukraine, Russia's struggling war economy, strained by international sanctions, rising inflation, and high production costs, may eventually force Moscow to the negotiating table. According to experts, Russia's stockpiles of Soviet-era military equipment are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 would require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. While Russia's Economic Development Ministry anticipates a slowdown in economic growth, factors beyond its control, such as tighter sanctions on its "shadow fleet" and declining oil prices due to global tariffs, are exacerbating the situation. The ministry expects significantly lower revenues from oil and gas this year and has raised its budget deficit estimate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng are experiencing a significant rally, with analysts predicting further gains as the company introduces new models and progresses toward profitability. Xpeng's Hong Kong shares jumped following strong earnings and a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter, driven by robust sales that quadrupled year-over-year. This improved performance has narrowed the company's net loss and boosted its gross margin, leading analysts to anticipate Xpeng will break even in the fourth quarter of this year and achieve a turnaround by early 2026. The brokerage maintains a buy rating on the stock and pegs target price at 150 Hong Kong dollars — over 76% upside from its current price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy staffers were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D.C. by a suspect who expressed solidarity with Palestine. The incident occurred after an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, prompting a swift response from law enforcement officials. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody after the shooting, and the victims were identified as a young couple about to be engaged. President Trump condemned the killings as antisemitic, and local officials vowed to combat violence and hate in the city, while the FBI is assisting local police in the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers mounted a remarkable comeback, overcoming a double-digit fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers and Tyrese Haliburton's near buzzer-beater highlighted the Pacers' late-game surge, while Jalen Brunson's 43 points for the Knicks were not enough to secure the win. This series is a rematch of the second round last year, which Indiana won in seven games against an injury-riddled Knicks squad, but it's also who the Knicks faced in both the 1999 and 2000 Eastern Conference Finals – the teams split both of those series. The Knicks will look to rebound in Game 2 at Madison Square Garden.</p>

          <p>Britain faces significant economic and political divisions, threatening the UK's stability, and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is attempting to address these challenges. Public confidence in the government is low, and the UK's fragmented state requires a cohesive political and economic purpose. Starmer's Council of the Nations and Regions aims to foster collaboration between the UK government, devolved governments, and mayors, but faces challenges due to differing powers and the need for tangible action. The collaborative political impulse is not widespread among Westminster parties, and this week’s council may seem a sideshow to some, yet it could hold the key to whether public confidence in politics begins to grow again.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK suggests releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence, aiming to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and limiting short custodial sentences to exceptional cases. While the government plans to build new prisons, the review warns that construction alone cannot solve the crisis, with Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood expected to respond to the review in the House of Commons, and tens of thousands more offenders could also be tagged under the proposals, putting further pressure on an already stretched probation system.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the complex transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa and the concerns of the MAGA movement and Donald Trump regarding the welfare of white Afrikaners. The article disputes claims of systematic civil rights violations against white South Africans, highlighting their continued economic privilege despite the country's inequality. The author argues that right-wing Afrikaners are exploiting MAGA culture by falsely alleging a campaign of targeted violence against rural farmers and attempts to rewrite South Africa’s history. The article critiques Trump's actions, including offering refugee status to Afrikaners and raising the issue of alleged violence against them during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to revoke California's vehicle emissions waivers, a move Democrats are calling the "nuclear option" due to potential procedural overreach. The waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. While Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act permits overturning agency rules, nonpartisan watchdogs disagree, and Democrats warn of setting a dangerous precedent. California officials vow to sue if the waivers are revoked, as the decision could impact numerous states that have adopted California's standards and the auto industry is divided on the issue.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning of a potential 1,000-foot-tall "mega tsunami" that could devastate parts of America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially causing coastal land to sink and triggering massive waves. Unlike gradual climate events, this potential earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation, with the most severe effects expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer (M&S) website is completely down as the retailer continues to grapple with the aftermath of a cyber attack from last month. The retailer estimates the cyber-attack will hit this year's profits by around £300m and some personal customer data was stolen, including telephone numbers, home addresses and dates of birth, however, the data theft did not include useable payment or card details, or any account passwords. Police are focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers, known as Scattered Spider, the same group is believed to have been behind attacks on the Co-op and Harrods.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is poised to vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill, following weeks of intra-party disagreements over spending cuts. The bill, which extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and increases military and immigration enforcement spending, has faced opposition from both hardliners seeking deeper cuts and moderates concerned about hurting voters. The bill’s passage would set the stage for debate in the Republican-led Senate, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimating it will add $3.8tr to the US’s $36.2tr in debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade tactics are creating uncertainty for India and its American business partners, particularly Apple, which has been shifting production away from China. Despite India's efforts to attract businesses fleeing China and its cozy relationship with Mr. Trump, things are looking tougher for India now. Mr. Trump has changed up his tactics with China, backing off his highest tariffs, and demanding that Apple move production to the United States instead of India. Indian officials are uncertain about Mr. Trump’s remarks about Apple, but the situation is further complicating trade negotiations before the tariff reprieve ends.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to provide $1,000 to every American baby born over the next four years, deposited into what would now be called a “Trump account.” The money would be invested in financial markets and accessible later for expenses like college or buying a house, with additional contributions allowed from parents or third parties. Tax experts are puzzled by the accounts' structure, as they would function similarly to typical investment accounts with post-tax contributions and taxed gains upon withdrawal.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office on Wednesday, but Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa and a South African judge, have denied the existence of a white genocide in the country. While claims of a white genocide have been disallowed by the court, it is true that there is a problem with farmers being murdered in South Africa. South African crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims, and there is no specific category for farm murders.</p>

The EU's foreign policy chief stated that the funding is a safety net for the network's independent journalism, with Sweden also pledging support, and a federal judge has ordered the release of some withheld funds.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revised gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers, ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The government subsidy aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, a targeted 5 yen effective decrease from a week earlier when crude price fluctuations are taken into account. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>

Together, Altman and Ive say they want to create hardware built specifically for AI software, and such technology “deserves something much better” than today’s laptops. Moving into hardware could become OpenAI’s most technologically disruptive, and financially lucrative, expansion to date. The company, once a small research lab, is now valued at $300 billion and growing rapidly, and in March reported that half a billion people use ChatGPT each week.</p>
