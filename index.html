          <p>Munich Airport is reportedly planning a dedicated terminal for processing migrant deportations, a move supported by conservative politicians but criticized by others. The proposal, aiming for a 2028 completion, is designed to streamline the repatriation of individuals with rejected asylum claims or criminal convictions. Separately, the Central Committee of German Catholics has expressed dismay over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging the German government to ensure Israel respects international law and highlighting the severe impact of military operations on the civilian population.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that the party must offer hope and fix problems, rather than simply being a "repository of disenchantment," especially in the face of the rising threat from Reform UK. In an interview, she identified Argentine President Javier Milei, known for his aggressive cost-cutting measures, as a "template" for her leadership style. Despite the party's poor polling and recent election defeats, Badenoch dismissed concerns about her leadership, emphasizing her resilience and focus on assembling a team of "heavy hitters" for her shadow cabinet.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, exceeding analyst expectations and signaling it is on track to meet its annual targets. The positive results came despite the strengthening euro impacting U.S. dollar-denominated business and mixed performance in its investment banking unit, where a decline in advisory revenue offset gains in fixed income and currencies. The bank's CFO noted sluggish corporate loan growth but expressed confidence in the firm's momentum, cost discipline, and the renewed stability in German politics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has been forced to withdraw from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after experiencing concussion symptoms during training. This is the second time a head injury has sidelined him on the tour, with Huw Jones now starting in his place alongside Bundee Aki. Coach Andy Farrell and captain Maro Itoje praised Ringrose for his selflessness in reporting his symptoms, highlighting the importance of player honesty regarding head injuries. The team, featuring a record nine Irish players, is aiming to secure a historic back-to-back tour victory in Australia.</p>

          <p>Renewed fighting has erupted between Thai and Cambodian forces along their disputed border, resulting in at least one civilian death and several injuries from a reported Cambodian rocket strike. Both nations have accused the other of initiating the hostilities near ancient temples in the contested region. Thailand claims its soldiers responded after a Cambodian drone was spotted and armed soldiers approached, while Cambodia alleges an unprovoked violation of its territory. The escalation, which reportedly involved Thai F-16 fighter jets, follows heightened diplomatic tensions and a recent landmine incident.</p>

          <p>Records from a New Orleans court case show that the late Jesuit superior general, Pedro Arrupe, was warned in 1977 that an aspiring priest, Donald J. Dickerson, had been accused of sexually molesting minors. Despite the warning and a recommendation to delay ordination, Dickerson was eventually ordained and later faced further accusations of abuse. The revelations have emerged from a lawsuit alleging Dickerson sexually assaulted a student at a Jesuit university. A current Jesuit official described the handling of the case as "appalling," raising serious questions about Arrupe, who is currently a candidate for Catholic sainthood.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, served as an entertaining spectacle but also sparked debate about its relevance, underscored by Lionel Messi's decision to skip the event. While the game showcased top talent, Messi's absence suggests that for global stars, a mid-season exhibition is less important than crucial league matches. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the issue, admitting that while the event is commercially important, the league needs to reconsider its format to maintain player engagement and boost its modest broadcast viewership in an increasingly congested global soccer calendar.</p>

The university did not admit wrongdoing but acknowledged that reform was necessary to address unacceptable incidents experienced by Jewish students and faculty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a substantially lower risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Researchers argue this is a more realistic and evidence-based target for many people than the popular but unscientific goal of 10,000 steps. The analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that the health benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps for most conditions. This finding could encourage more people to use step tracking as a simple and effective way to improve their long-term health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This marks a significant shift from the long-standing policy of transferring all unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to government-run shelters overseen by Health and Human Services. The change, enabled by new authorities in a recent spending law, was previously limited to children from Mexico and Canada. If the teens decline the offer, they will still be transferred to the shelter system for placement with a sponsor.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) in England has cancelled thousands of scheduled water tests for pollutants like nitrates and phosphates over the last three months due to significant staff shortages.

Critics, including former EA employees, state that routine testing is essential for tracking river health and identifying problems quickly.

          <p>An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, washed ashore in La Jolla, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, distinguished by their vibrant purple shells, typically live in warmer subtropical waters and float on the ocean surface using a self-secreted bubble raft. Researchers noted the discovery coincided with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists will be monitoring for more of these snails as a potential indicator of changing ocean conditions.</p>

From the band's working-class Birmingham roots, Osbourne and his bandmates reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the 1960s to create a darker, heavier sound. Their music, defined by Tony Iommi's powerful guitar riffs and Osbourne's wailing vocals, set the template for generations of rock bands. Despite a life of legendary debauchery, Osbourne's musical contributions, from "Paranoid" to "Crazy Train," have left an indelible mark on music history.</p>

This contrasts sharply with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties.
