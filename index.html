          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at many major U.S. airports. A recent memo indicated the new rule would allow all travelers, not just those in PreCheck, to keep their shoes on unless they trigger an alarm. This change reverses a policy enacted in 2006, five years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe on an American Airlines flight. The goal is to streamline the security process and improve passenger flow nationwide.</p>

          <p>A court in the United Kingdom has found three men guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse containing equipment destined for Ukraine. British officials stated the attack was ordered by the Russian paramilitary organization, the Wagner Group, which is banned as a terrorist entity in the UK. The prosecutor detailed that one of the ringleaders knowingly acted for Russian interests, with the March 2024 blaze causing approximately £1 million in damages. The conviction highlights the extension of Russia-linked operations onto British soil.</p>

          <h2>IRS Policy Shift Allows Churches to Endorse Political Candidates Without Losing Tax-Exempt Status</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 11:01:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has reversed its 70-year interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, now permitting churches to endorse political candidates without risking their tax-exempt status. This significant policy change emerged from a federal court filing involving the National Religious Broadcasters and two Texas churches. The IRS now argues that when a house of worship discusses electoral politics through the lens of faith with its congregation, it does not constitute intervention in a political campaign. This development fulfills a long-standing objective of former President Donald Trump to repeal the amendment.</p>

          <p>According to a monthly survey by the New York Federal Reserve, consumer fears about sharp inflation driven by tariffs have subsided, with expectations returning to levels seen before the trade disputes intensified. The June survey shows respondents anticipate inflation at 3% in the next year, down from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect price increases in key areas like medical care, college education, and rent. The report also noted improved sentiment regarding employment, with fewer people expecting job losses.</p>

This initiative aims to develop a more nuanced, forward-looking approach to economic management as the country drafts its 2026-2030 development plan.

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects the annual cost of the state pension triple lock will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times its original estimate. The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report warns that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position" due to rising government debt and the reversal of planned spending cuts. This long-term spending pressure, driven by an aging population and volatile inflation, places the nation's finances on an unsustainable path.</p>

Higher education experts warn that this will create revenue shortfalls for top research institutions, forcing them to find other ways to cover costs.

The article explains that feeling safe in a relationship means being able to be vulnerable without fear of judgment and believing that your partner is committed through both good and bad times.

          <p>In a climate of economic uncertainty, financial advisors are recommending several strategies for savers to balance security with growth. Popular choices for short-term savings and emergency funds include high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, and laddered CDs, which offer competitive interest rates while keeping funds accessible. Some advisors also utilize brokerage cash sweeps to earn returns on uninvested money. The article stresses aligning these low-risk strategies with long-term goals, which often require exposure to growth assets like stocks to effectively combat inflation over time.

          <p>Commercial vehicle manufacturer Daimler Truck has announced it will eliminate approximately 5,000 jobs in Germany by the year 2030. The decision follows a reported 5% drop in second-quarter sales, with particularly weak performance in the U.S. market. The job cuts are part of a cost-saving program aimed at improving the profitability and market resilience of its European Mercedes-Benz Trucks division, with a goal of saving over €1 billion annually. The company stated the workforce reduction will be managed through socially responsible means like natural attrition and early retirement.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhunzada, and the head of Afghanistan's supreme court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution, specifically targeting women and girls since the group seized power nearly four years ago. The warrants also accuse the leaders of persecuting individuals who do not conform to the Taliban's gender policies and those perceived as political allies of women. This marks a significant step by the international court to hold the Taliban leadership accountable.</p>

          <p>Spanish police report that evidence suggests Liverpool footballer Diogo Jota was likely driving at an excessive speed before the fatal crash that killed him and his brother. The 28-year-old's Lamborghini reportedly suffered a tire blowout on a motorway in Zamora province, causing it to leave the road and catch fire. Investigators are preparing a report for the courts, noting the case's complexity due to the vehicle being almost completely destroyed by the fire. The tragic accident occurred just eleven days after Jota had married his long-term partner, with whom he had three children.</p>

Currently about 670 million kilometers from the sun, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass at a distance of about 240 million kilometers in October. Scientists are still determining its precise velocity and trajectory but estimate it is about 20 kilometers wide and traveling at 60 kilometers per second. This discovery provides another rare opportunity to study an object from beyond our solar system, offering clues about other planetary systems.</p>

In his previous bid against incumbent Deb Fischer, Osborn significantly outperformed expectations, forcing Republicans to invest heavily in a state considered a safe seat.

The memo, which also found no credible evidence of blackmail, contradicts long-held conspiracy theories and previous suggestions by officials that such a list existed. Many pro-Trump figures are now accusing the federal government and the "deep state" of protecting powerful individuals involved with the late sex offender.

          <p>The Supreme Court is facing criticism for issuing an unexplained order that allows the Trump administration to deport migrants to third countries without due process, a practice critics argue violates international torture conventions. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor condemned the majority for rewarding the administration's defiance of lower court orders and eroding respect for the rule of law. The lack of a written opinion justifying the decision has been called a threat to judicial transparency, turning the Court into a simple vote-counting body rather than an institution of reasoned legal interpretation.</p>

The diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and trans fats.

Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) shows a decade-long decline in reading proficiency, particularly among lower-achieving students, a trend that worsened during the pandemic. While some experts point to flawed teaching methods and the rise of screen time, others argue that standardized tests don't capture the complex digital literacy skills today's youth possess.

In response, Trump has threatened additional tariffs on nations backing the group's policies.
