          <p>Two Japanese boxers, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, have tragically died from brain injuries sustained in separate fights during the same event in Tokyo. The deaths have prompted an immediate response from the Japan Boxing Commission, which announced a shortening of championship bouts from 12 to 10 rounds. This incident has reignited a serious debate in Japan and internationally regarding boxing safety, with advocates calling for stricter regulations, mandatory post-fight medical scans, and better concussion protocols to protect fighters. The global boxing community has expressed its grief over the loss of the two athletes.</p>

          <p>A U.S. permanent resident and Vietnamese entrepreneur, Luu Anh Tuan, has been sentenced to 16 years in a Vietnamese prison on charges his advocates claim are politically motivated by China. Tuan was developing technology to break China's monopoly on heavy rare-earth element separation and was in the process of transferring this technology to a U.S. company. His arrest is viewed by supporters as an effort by China, which exerts significant influence in Vietnam, to maintain its stranglehold on the critical minerals market. The case highlights the intense geopolitical competition over rare earths, which are essential for advanced technology and defense systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political commentators and critics are expressing growing concern over a perceived trend towards authoritarianism in the United States 200 days into the Trump administration. The article cites several actions, including demands to prosecute political opponents, the firing of a top government statistician, and efforts to exert federal control over Washington D.C., as evidence of an expanding use of presidential power. While the term 'fascism' was once dismissed by many, there is an increasing consensus among some observers that the foundational pillars of U.S. democracy are being systematically challenged. This analysis suggests the administration's actions are more calculated than in its first term, raising alarms about the country's constitutional future.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have engaged in extensive overnight drone attacks, with both sides reporting hundreds of launches and dozens of impacts. The escalation in military action comes as diplomatic maneuvers intensify ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials are firmly insisting that any peace negotiations must include Kyiv and respect its territorial integrity, rejecting any proposals of ceding land. Meanwhile, European leaders have issued a joint statement supporting Ukraine's position, emphasizing that a path to peace cannot be decided without the country's direct involvement and that international borders must be respected.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have demonstrated across Israel against the government's plan to expand its military operations into Gaza City. Critics of the plan fear it will endanger the lives of the remaining hostages and soldiers, with some calling for an end to the war to secure their release. The demonstrations highlight a significant internal division, with polls suggesting most Israelis favor a deal with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces opposition not only from the public but also reportedly from military leaders who warn that a full occupation would be a strategic trap.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to hold an emergency session to address Israel's plan to expand its military operation and take security control of Gaza City. The proposal has drawn widespread international condemnation, with several countries, including the UK and Germany, strongly rejecting it and warning of catastrophic humanitarian consequences. In a related development, a new poll indicates that a majority of Germans now support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state. This diplomatic pressure coincides with ongoing humanitarian crises in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry reports a rising death toll from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing the asylum applications of some immigrants who have been in the U.S. for years, citing a procedural issue. Dozens of applicants have received letters stating their cases are being closed because they did not undergo a mandatory "credible fear" interview upon entering the country between 2019 and 2022. Immigration lawyers argue this is due to a shortage of asylum officers at the time and that their clients are now being penalized for a systemic failure. This policy effectively forces documented individuals to become undocumented again, revokes their work permits, and requires them to report to ICE, where they risk detention while trying to restart their asylum claims.</p>

The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England as a mass of warm air is drawn up from the south. Forecasters predict temperatures could peak at 34C (93F) in the south Midlands on Tuesday, marking a significant shift from the stormy weather experienced earlier in the week. While England and Wales are expected to see the most sunshine, the heat may also trigger scattered thunderstorms, and pollen levels are forecast to be high.</p>

Turkish tourists are attracted by the island's relaxed atmosphere, good food, and relative affordability compared to Turkish holiday destinations. This influx is providing a welcome boost to the local economy and is seen by officials as a way to strengthen cross-border relations and heal historical wounds. Despite ongoing political tensions between Athens and Ankara over maritime borders, the person-to-person connections forged through tourism are creating a pocket of goodwill in the Aegean.</p>

Led by Gao Caixia at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the new systems, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), make it easier and more efficient to edit DNA segments ranging from thousands to millions of base pairs. This breakthrough is expected to accelerate advancements in crop improvement and the treatment of genetic diseases. According to the institute, the technology could also pave the way for the development of artificial chromosomes, a key area in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, he predicted this moment could occur within the next one to three years. He defined this leap as a robot being able to perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an environment it has never seen before. Wang suggested that current hardware is sufficient, but the 'embodied intelligence' AI required for such a feat is still inadequate, though he noted promising developments in world model generation.</p>

          <p>A small, circular piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial piece of evidence that led to the conviction of Matthew Ecker for the murder of nurse Alexandra Pennig. Ecker claimed Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide, and that he broke the door down afterward to help her. However, investigators found the metal lock component underneath Pennig's body, indicating the door was forced open before she was shot and fell. This discovery contradicted Ecker's timeline and supported the prosecution's theory that he broke in and then killed her. Ecker was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder.</p>

Unlike the massive anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, the current escalation is met with a concerning public silence.

Many programs, often staffed by women who were once refugees themselves, offer tailored support like one-to-one counseling, job fairs, and mentoring.
