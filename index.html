          <p>Ukrainian forces reportedly destroyed dozens of Russian warplanes in a coordinated drone strike, dubbed "Spider’s Web," that targeted five military airfields deep inside Russia. The operation, planned over 18 months and overseen by President Zelensky, involved small FPV drones hidden in wooden cabins mounted on trucks. Russia acknowledged the attack as a "terrorist act" and admitted that several aircraft caught fire, while Ukraine claimed that 34% of Russia’s strategic bombers were hit. The attack happened just before planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to begin Monday in Istanbul, which are backed by President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic, with record domestic passenger numbers and a quadrupling of international visitors. Japanese shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K.

NYK Cruises will launch the Asuka III, while Mitsui Ocean Cruises will add a third ship, and Oriental Land, which operates Tokyo Disney Resort, will take over the operation and management of cruise ships scheduled to enter service in fiscal 2028. This reflects a broader recovery in leisure travel and a boost to local economies reliant on tourism.</p>

          <p>Amid President Donald Trump's renewed push for mass deportations, fear is growing among U.S. residents and citizens, particularly those with irregular status. Immigration lawyer Álex Gálvez notes that standard immigration laws are not being respected, leading to arrests at immigration courts. While citizens should not fear questioning upon returning from travel, residents face discretion from officials, especially if staying abroad over six months or having a criminal record. Those with DACA and TPS face similar risks, with limited advance parole options, highlighting the precarious situation for many immigrants and the need for legal advice to navigate these challenges.</p>

          <p>A new report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as financial challenges lead to course cutbacks. Universities UK found that institutions are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws, which promote competition. Greater collaboration could help universities cut costs and become more efficient, ensuring students have access to desired subjects in their home regions. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recognizes the financial problems facing universities and aims to support collaboration where possible, though significant changes may require government action.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa faces a political firestorm after approving a law that allows the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation. The law, intended to increase black ownership of land, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and local political parties, who fear it threatens property rights. The government insists compensation will be paid in most cases, particularly for productive agricultural land, while legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would occur only in limited circumstances. The new law is expected to make it easier for the government to acquire land and restore it to black people dispossessed during white-minority rule.</p>

          <p>Senior officials at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking with the public. This decision followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, co-authored by VA pulmonologists, warning that cancelled contracts, layoffs, and staff reductions jeopardize veterans' health. Veterans advocates criticize the decision as censorship, fitting a pattern under the Trump administration, and raising concerns about transparency and the ability of medical professionals to advocate for their patients.</p>

Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection, believes the pardons contribute to lies and propaganda. Unlike other Jan. 6 defendants who sought their pardons, Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to formally refuse the clemency. Her actions contrast with those who championed their pardons and used them in court, underscoring her belief in accountability for the events of that day.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, continues to fight for what he believes is a rightfully owed military pension, a battle he has waged since the 1980s.

Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from MPs, Williams has been told his pension reflects his full and correct entitlement.

          <p>Jim Cramer discusses how President Donald Trump's policies and unpredictability are negatively impacting the stock market, creating what he calls a "Trump discount." He argues that the lack of predictability is driving investors to other markets, despite the strong performance of many U.S. companies. Cramer highlights specific sectors and companies, including Nvidia, retail, drug companies, Apple, and energy, that are being held back by this uncertainty. He also notes that the administration's approach to regulation, trade, and other issues is contributing to the market's anxiety, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest.

This election is seen as an opportunity to steer South Korea back to stability and heal divisions, with Lee promising to prevent future martial law declarations.
