          <h2>Trump Considers Tariff Exemptions for Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 17:17:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering tariff exemptions for automakers on imports from China, including auto parts, steel, and aluminum. This potential relief comes after lobbying from automakers and policy groups concerned about the compounding costs of existing and upcoming tariffs. The exemptions would be separate from existing tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts scheduled to take effect in May. Industry officials are particularly worried about the impact of tariffs on auto parts, which could jeopardize U.S. automotive production and further distress suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states is suing the Trump administration in the US Court of International Trade, challenging the legality of its tariff policies. The states argue that the tariffs are unlawful, creating economic chaos and subjecting national trade policy to the President's whims. New York Attorney General Letitia James stated that the tariffs risk causing severe economic damage throughout the United States, leading to inflation, unemployment, and broader economic harm.

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile day, initially surging on news of potential trade deal progress with China and President Trump's comments about not firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. However, gains were pared back as investors worried about the impact of the White House's tariff policies on the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated an opportunity for a significant trade deal with China, while Capital Economics projected potential reductions in import taxes on Chinese goods. Despite the market's initial enthusiasm, concerns about the durability of the rally remain, particularly given the International Monetary Fund's recent projection of a global economic slowdown driven by the trade war.

          <p>Opening statements have begun in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing him of using his power to sexually abuse women. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer is casting doubt on the women's claims. The retrial centers on allegations from three women, with prosecutors detailing the alleged encounters. Weinstein's attorney argued that the women had mutually beneficial relationships with him and are motivated by fame. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned due to the admission of testimony from women whose allegations were not part of the charges.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir addressed a meeting at Yale University after being honored at a dinner at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.

His presence in the Israeli government and his reception in the US have drawn international concern.

The plan involves lifting sanctions against Russia, accepting a cease-fire that leaves Russian troops in conquered Ukrainian territory, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia. In return, Ukraine would receive a weak security guarantee and be prohibited from joining NATO. Critics argue that this plan would destroy Ukraine and reward Russia for its aggression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to reach numerous individual trade deals with other governments in a short time frame after tariffs sow global chaos. The administration has set up a seemingly impossible task, given that traditional trade deals typically take months or years to negotiate. The levies are creating chaos and financial pain for many businesses, and they have not brought some of America’s largest trading partners, including China, to the table. Some U.S. trade with China has ground to a halt after the countries imposed triple-digit tariffs on each others’ products.</p>
