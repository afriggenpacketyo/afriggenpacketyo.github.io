          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass indicated on Tuesday that curfews are under consideration following recent protests against federal immigration sweeps. While looting occurred Monday night, Bass stated that the demonstrations were smaller and less violent than previous days. She emphasized that the unrest is limited to a few blocks in the downtown area and does not represent the entire city. Bass urged ICE to halt the raids, citing the disruption to immigrant families and the local economy in a city built on immigration.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Fort Bragg on Tuesday after deploying the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to integrate with the 2,100 National Guard members already present, tasked with protecting federal personnel and property. Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the president and Hegseth over the decision to deploy the National Guard against his wishes, arguing that Title 10 was improperly invoked.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes the company's acquisition of Preqin, a $3.2 billion deal for the alternative asset data provider, could be the most consequential move for expanding private market access. The integration of Preqin's data into BlackRock's platforms aims to bring transparency and benchmarks to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue and earnings, reducing reliance on the volatility of public markets. The acquisition has already contributed to revenue growth and increased annual contract values, with the longer-term goal of creating private-market benchmarks and accessible index products.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is facing growing concerns about a potential financial crisis due to an ongoing price war led by market leader BYD. The price cuts, with some discounts as steep as 34%, are depressing profits for both manufacturers and sellers, leading to warnings from industry executives about an "unhealthy" market. One executive drew parallels to China's struggling property sector and the Evergrande crisis, raising alarms about the sustainability of the current competition.

          <p>A recent school shooting in Graz, Austria, which resulted in multiple fatalities, has highlighted the relative rarity of such incidents in Europe compared to the United States. In response to past shootings, European governments have tightened gun laws, as seen in the UK after the Dunblane massacre and in Germany after shootings in Erfurt and Winnenden. While mass shootings are less frequent in Europe, knife attacks at schools are more common, prompting reflection on school safety measures. Research suggests that stricter firearm laws and lower rates of civilian gun ownership may contribute to the lower incidence of mass shootings in Europe.</p>

          <p>Emperor penguin populations in Antarctica are declining faster than previously anticipated, according to a study analyzing satellite images from 2009 to 2024. The study reveals a 22% decline in the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea, and Bellingshausen Sea, which house a third of the global emperor penguin population. Researchers attribute the decline to climate change, which is thinning and destabilizing the ice used for breeding. While further analysis is needed to confirm the trend across the continent, the findings suggest that current climate models may underestimate the severity of the threat to emperor penguins.</p>

Despite the surge, the analysis argues that gold remains a worthwhile investment due to the potential for further price increases and its role as a portfolio diversifier.

          <h2>JD Vance's Opinion on British Free Speech</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 13:10:43 EDT</div>

          <p>The Guardian article analyzes JD Vance's claim that Britain has a free speech problem, agreeing that the claim is not without merit. The author, a British-Palestinian living in the U.S., highlights the irony of potentially self-deporting to the UK due to concerns about free speech, given the U.S.'s own issues. The article cites vague laws and police powers in Britain, which lead to arrests for offensive online speech, as well as anti-protest laws that stifle dissent. The author argues that while the U.S. faces its own challenges, Britain's restrictions on free speech warrant serious consideration.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tax Bill May Increase Taxes for Foreign Companies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 13:10:34 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tax bill includes a provision that could raise taxes on foreign companies operating in the United States. The measure, known as Section 899, would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries deemed to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Critics argue that this provision could deter foreign investment and negatively impact job growth. Republican Rep. Jason Smith defends the measure as a tool to protect U.S. interests against countries with unfavorable tax codes. (not investment advice)</p>
