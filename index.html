        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are embroiled in a public dispute stemming from Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. The feud escalated after Musk called the bill "fiscally reckless," leading to Trump threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX. Musk responded by accusing Trump of ingratitude and falsely claiming he ousted Musk from the White House. The conflict raises concerns about the potential impact on Musk's business ventures and the future of government contracts with SpaceX, particularly the Dragon spacecraft program.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing to a point where it can easily extract personal information from seemingly innocuous online content, such as vacation photos. This poses significant threats to digital privacy, as AI can now perform tasks that previously required extensive human effort, such as identifying a person's location from a single image. Experts warn that AI companies may not be as cautious with user data as established tech giants like Google, raising concerns about potential misuse.

          <p>Proposed funding cuts to National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) by the Trump administration would disproportionately harm rural communities that rely on these services for news, information, and emergency alerts. With the decline of local newspapers, public media has become a crucial source of credible reporting in many parts of America. Advocates argue that these cuts would exacerbate the problem of "news deserts" and undermine democracy. The article urges voters to contact their elected representatives and express their support for continued funding of public media.</p>

          <p>A woman is suing an Atlanta police officer for allegedly leaving her topless in a squad car for several hours during a pre-dawn raid. The incident reportedly occurred during a raid related to the arson of police motorcycles and cars in opposition to a controversial police training center.

Exhausted by continual policy shifts and disillusioned by Trump’s volatility, many are delaying major decisions until clearer signals emerge. The manufacturers are hesitant to make long-term decisions based on Trump's words alone, preferring to wait for signed agreements. The call between the leaders covered trade relations, rare earth exports, and overseas students, but failed to spark immediate enthusiasm on Chinese factory floors.</p>

          <p>Resentment, a simmering emotion stemming from broken expectations or perceived injustices, can silently erode relationships. It often arises when needs are unmet and communication is lacking, leading to feelings of bitterness and contempt. Experts advise addressing resentments early on through direct, clarifying conversations that focus on expressing feelings and proposing solutions. In situations where direct communication is risky, such as in the workplace, alternative strategies like journaling or therapy can help manage these emotions.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is testing the resilience of roads, railways, and bridges, leading to melting roads, buckled rail tracks, and stressed bridges. Experts suggest remedies such as heat-reflective coatings for roads, painting rails white to absorb less heat, and using heat-resistant materials for railway tracks. Bridges can be climate-proofed with expansion joints and regular inspections. Adapting transport infrastructure is vital to maintain economic activity and community connectivity in a warming world.</p>

          <p>A new Ipsos poll reveals widespread dissatisfaction across Europe, with many believing their societies are broken and economies rigged. Negative sentiment has increased in major European economies, including Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy. In Great Britain, a majority of respondents expressed support for a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to address these issues. Economic concerns and dissatisfaction with the status quo are contributing to populist sentiment across the continent.</p>

          <h2>Kenyan Youth Question Ruto's New Jobs Initiative</h2>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto's new youth employment plan, NYOTA, which aims to create 800,000 jobs, has been met with skepticism by Gen Z Kenyans. Many question the feasibility of the plan due to budget constraints and past unfulfilled pledges. Experts also doubt the funding and sustainability of the initiative, citing a lack of clarity in the budget and a strained relationship between Ruto and young voters. The plan comes after youth-led demonstrations compelled the government to address public discontent.</p>
