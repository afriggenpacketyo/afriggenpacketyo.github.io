          <p>As a federal government shutdown continues, Representative Aaron Bean has introduced the "Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2025" to prevent disruptions to air travel. The proposed legislation would ensure that essential FAA personnel, such as air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, continue to receive pay. The bill aims to avoid flight delays and safety concerns by temporarily using funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which would be repaid after a funding agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially declared drug cartels operating in the Caribbean to be "unlawful combatants," framing the situation as a "non-international armed conflict." This designation follows recent U.S. military strikes on three boats in the Caribbean Sea that resulted in 17 fatalities. The move, which was communicated to Congress, represents a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to combating drug trafficking and has been interpreted by some as a way to increase pressure on the Venezuelan government.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have provided financial relief for homebuyers, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.34% from 6.93% earlier in the year. For a $700,000 loan, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, a saving of about $273 per month compared to January's rates. Over the full 30-year term, this lower rate could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has weakened to a post-tropical storm after hitting Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane, bringing heavy rain and powerful winds to the islands. While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the worst conditions have passed, and the system is now moving farther into the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted that swells from Imelda are still likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

The young object, named Cha 1107-7626, is located about 620 light-years away and is growing by pulling matter from a surrounding disc. This discovery is significant because the magnetic activity driving the process has previously only been seen in stars, suggesting some planet-like objects may form in a similar manner to stars.</p>

          <p>A drop in the average Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) rate to below 8% has made this a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $70,000 HELOC with a 15-year repayment period, the monthly payment is now around $664, approximately $33 less per month than it would have been a year ago when rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, homeowners can benefit from declining market rates without needing to refinance, making it an attractive option in the current economic climate.

          <p>While the overall U.S. unemployment rate remains stable, the rate for Black women has risen to 6.7%, a trend one expert calls a "warning sign." This increase is attributed to three main factors: corporate retreats from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives; cutbacks at small businesses; and layoffs within the federal government, where Black women are heavily represented. This concerning trend has prompted calls for the Federal Reserve to analyze the data and develop a plan to address the disparity.</p>
