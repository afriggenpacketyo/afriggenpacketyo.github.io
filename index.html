          <p>A second suspect, William Duplessie, has been apprehended in connection with the alleged kidnapping and torture of an Italian tourist in Manhattan over cryptocurrency. Duplessie turned himself in after his alleged accomplice, John Woeltz, was arrested the previous week; both face charges including kidnapping and assault. The victim claims he was held captive for 17 days, tortured, and threatened to reveal his Bitcoin wallet password. Police discovered photos of the victim's torture, firearms, and drugs during a search of the SoHo residence where the assaults allegedly took place. David Seltzer, a cyber-crime attorney, notes that these cases are becoming more prevalent as criminals see cryptocurrency as an easy way to obtain cash.</p>

Authorities are still searching for Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, who were part of a group that broke out by exploiting a faulty cell door and scaling a barbed-wire fence. The escapees left graffiti saying ‚ÄúTo Easy LoL‚Äù at the scene, highlighting security lapses at the jail. Conditions at the jail had been deteriorating prior to the escape, according to a watchdog report, which urged the sheriff to reestablish a high-security unit.

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts to combat shoplifting, leading to mixed reactions from customers. The cameras identify when an item isn't scanned properly and show a replay, prompting some shoppers to joke about "VAR"-style decisions, referencing the video assistant referee technology in football. Others have expressed concerns about increased surveillance, with one user voicing fears about potential future measures like drones following shoppers. The move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK, with retailers recording 20.4 million thefts in the past year, costing them ¬£2 billion.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop in April, declining by 49% year-on-year, while overall battery electric car sales rose by 34.1%. The decline is attributed to reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities, including endorsements of far-right parties and support for Donald Trump. Tesla's brand value has suffered, leading to protests at dealerships across Europe, and the company's aging car lineup faces increased competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players. European consumers are showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>U.S. companies report a surge in trade crime due to President Trump's steep global tariffs, which incentivize fraud. Shipping companies, primarily based in China, are offering ways to bypass tariffs on goods like apparel, auto parts, and jewelry. These schemes, costing the U.S. government billions in lost revenue, involve undervaluing products or transshipping them through countries with lower tariff rates. The Trump administration aims to combat trade fraud but many companies believe the scale of illicit activity far outweighs the government's enforcement capabilities.

          <p>Three large wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, while crews also battle fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, allowing for the lifting of all Minnesota evacuations on Memorial Day. The Jenkins Creek Fire is believed to be "human caused," while the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures. Donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected community members. Interactive maps are provided to track the fires' progress, updated regularly by the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

          <p>The search continues for Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief convicted of rape and murder, after he escaped from prison on Sunday.

He was reportedly wearing a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement when he escaped. Authorities are urging the public not to approach him, as he is considered armed and dangerous, and the former prosecutor who helped convict Hardin described him as a "sociopath."</p>

The push for additional aid comes amid widespread cuts to FEMA and resistance from the Trump administration for disaster spending.</p>

          <p>A surge in homelessness among late baby boomers is attributed to economic challenges and the loss of parental support, leaving many with nowhere to go as they reach old age. Anthony Forrest's story exemplifies this trend, as he became homeless after his mother, who provided housing, moved to a nursing home. This generation faced fierce competition for housing and jobs, economic recessions, and the crack epidemic, making them uniquely vulnerable to homelessness. The death of parents is extending this generational woe, with the number of homeless people 65 or older growing by half in four years.</p>

Circle will sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares, a pattern seen previously with Facebook's 2012 IPO. While Circle didn't provide a reason, the hefty amount of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns.
