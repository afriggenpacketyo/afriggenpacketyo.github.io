          <h2>Central Banks Navigate Currency Devaluation Amidst Weakening Dollar</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 23:27:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks globally, offering relief from dollar-denominated debt and import inflation but also posing challenges to export competitiveness. While some central banks might consider currency devaluation to boost exports, they risk stoking inflation and facing retaliation from the U.S. administration. The European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank are examples of institutions adapting to these currency shifts, with the ECB cutting rates and the SNB grappling with a strong franc affecting exports. For now, most central banks are avoiding aggressive devaluation to maintain economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses are facing significant pressure due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and the elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less. These changes have led to decreased revenue, products being stopped at borders for inspection, and squeezed profit margins for dropshippers, many of whom source products from China for the U.S. market. Some businesses are shifting their focus to the European market in response, while Chinese manufacturers are reporting pessimism and exploring alternative markets. Industry insiders emphasize the importance of diversifying supply and sales markets to navigate the evolving trade environment.</p>

Harvard's president, Alan Garber, argues that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or whom they can admit.

The project involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, then processing them into familiar foods.

          <p>Noor Abdalla, wife of detained Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, gave birth to their son without her husband present after ICE denied his request to attend. Khalil, held in a Louisiana detention facility, was only able to experience the birth via telephone. Khalil's lawyers suggested alternatives like a two-week furlough with an ankle monitor, but the request was denied. Abdalla, a US citizen, maintains that the Trump administration is silencing those who speak up for Palestinian rights and vows to continue fighting for Khalil's release.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after rejecting demands from the White House and having $2.2bn of government funding frozen. The university is accused of ideological bias and allowing antisemitism during campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Harvard's President Alan Garber rejected the demands, prompting President Trump to question whether the university should lose its tax-exempt status. The lawsuit describes the research funding freeze as "arbitrary and capricious" and violating its First Amendment rights.</p>
