          <p>A California high school girls' volleyball team, featuring a transgender athlete, has maintained an undefeated league record and secured first place, largely due to opponents forfeiting games. Eight teams have forfeited, believed to be in protest of the trans player, AB Hernandez. Two teammates have also left and filed a lawsuit against the school district, while California state legislature recently blocked bills to reverse the law allowing trans athletes in girls' sports. Governor Newsom's office has deferred responsibility to the CIF, CDE, and state legislature.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker reported that the Trump administration plans to federalize 300 National Guard members for Chicago, despite his repeated rejections, following an alleged ultimatum. This comes amidst heightened tensions, including a shooting involving federal agents and alleged chemical agent deployment during ICE activities in the city. Pritzker criticized the move as a 'manufactured performance' driven by control rather than public safety. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the deployment request, stating it was to 'control the scene' after federal agents were reportedly attacked.</p>

          <p>The annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach proceeded without U.S. military aircraft due to a federal government shutdown, disappointing many attendees who consider the military displays a main attraction. Despite the absence, international forces like the British Royal Air Force and Canadian Armed Forces performed, and the event still drew large crowds. Attendees expressed mixed feelings, with some veterans feeling emotional about the missing U.S. presence, while others appreciated the international acts and historical American aviation displays.

          <p>Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champions, experienced a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea, conceding a goal in the 95th minute, marking their second late-goal loss in a week. This article highlights a troubling pattern for Arne Slot's side, who previously relied on late winners but are now suffering from defensive vulnerabilities and a lack of form. Despite creating chances, Liverpool's new signings have seemingly unbalanced the team, leading to their first three-game losing streak under Slot. The international break is seen as a potential opportunity for the team to regroup and address these issues.</p>

          <p>Democrats are actively countering what they call Republican 'lies' regarding healthcare for undocumented immigrants during the ongoing government shutdown debate. This article clarifies that federal law prohibits federal funding for healthcare for undocumented immigrants, beyond emergency Medicaid. Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson, have falsely claimed Democrats are trying to provide 'free healthcare for illegals.'
