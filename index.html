          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to prevent lower court rulings from forcing the return of a man deported to El Salvador. A federal judge in Maryland had ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return, a decision supported by an appeals court. The administration claims Garcia's deportation was an administrative error, though they also allege he is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his family denies. The government argues the Maryland judge overstepped authority and the U.S. cannot compel El Salvador to return Garcia.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has altered a webpage about the Underground Railroad, removing a quote and image of Harriet Tubman, and instead emphasizing "Black/White Cooperation." The changes come as the Trump administration actively rolls back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across the federal government. The revised page now starts with images of stamps depicting five Black and white abolitionists, including Tubman, with text overlaying the images that reads: “Black/White Cooperation.” The move sparked backlash, with critics accusing the administration of attempting to erase diversity from US history.</p>

          <p>Global bond yields have sharply declined following the announcement of U.S. tariffs, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid a significant stock market sell-off.

The big flight to cash continues as investors seek a shelter for their money amid the tariff storm, and red lights are flashing about a looming global recession.</p>

          <p>Restaurant stocks have fallen as investors worry about a potential recession following President Trump's announcement of tariffs on imported goods. Analysts don't expect the tariffs to directly affect restaurant companies, but the anticipated inflation could strain consumer spending. Shares of Starbucks fell after a downgrade citing near-term economic headwinds, with concerns including higher coffee costs due to tariffs and anti-American sentiment. Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk, as consumers in China have previously boycotted Western brands for political reasons.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices have fallen to their lowest level since 2021 due to fears that President Trump's global tariffs will push the U.S. into a recession. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also fell. The decision by OPEC+ producers to increase production hikes has also contributed to the downward pressure. Trump touted the steep fall in oil prices, but worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, ultimately hurting demand for oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southampton has sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, marking the sixth manager the club has had in their past two Premier League campaigns. Juric won just two of his 16 matches, leaving the club 22 points from safety. The frequent managerial changes raise questions about the club's direction and whether the initial decision to sack Russell Martin was a mistake. Southampton's relegation on Sunday leaves them searching for a new manager to lead them back up, with many questioning whether the sacking of Martin was a mistake in the first place?</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock exchanges implement trading halts, known as circuit breakers, to manage rapid stock price declines and prevent market crashes. These halts occur during extreme volatility, such as the current situation with surging global trade tensions. There are three circuit breaker levels based on S&P 500 declines: 7%, 13%, and 20%. If the S&P 500 falls 7% or 13% intraday before 3:25 p.m. ET, trading is halted for 15 minutes. A 20% plunge suspends trading for the rest of the day.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell wears purple ties to signal the central bank's non-political stance. Powell stated that it felt awkward to wear red or blue ties, which are often associated with Republican or Democratic parties, respectively. The Federal Reserve operates autonomously from the White House and governs monetary policy independently, free from political pressure. While Fed board members are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate, the central bank is theoretically free from political pressure.</p>

          <p>Rob Key has chosen Harry Brook as England's white-ball captain, taking a gamble on the young batter over Ben Stokes. Brook, despite his youth, possesses a strong cricket brain and a remarkable work ethic. His leadership style is expected to mirror England's aggressive Test cricket approach. The biggest concern with appointing Brook is the increased workload it adds to his already busy schedule. Key believes the risk is worth taking, despite the potential for burnout.</p>

          <p>Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, prompting questions about their impact. Experts explain that stock market indices reflect the total value of listed companies, with larger companies having more weight. Market downturns can affect pensions, especially defined contribution plans, but pension investing is a long-term game. Tariffs are unpopular in the US and could lead to increased prices and a potential recession. While the US is comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that most Americans enjoy reading and want to do it more often, but it's not a top priority. While 82% believe reading is a useful way to learn and 76% find it relaxing, only 51% read a book in the past month. People are more likely to spend time watching streaming services, using social media, or watching short-form videos. The most common reason for not reading more is a lack of time, with people prioritizing family time, watching TV, exercising, or other life activities.</p>

The visit aims to reinforce ties with European allies amidst international uncertainty and is part of the UK's post-Brexit reset. The visit includes elaborate ceremonies, meetings with Italian officials, and a focus on closer military ties and trade relations. The King has had a complicated diplomatic balancing act, as head of state of both the UK and Canada, at a time when Canada has been put under great pressure by the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can generally negotiate home equity loan closing costs, particularly lender-controlled fees like origination, application, appraisal, and title fees. Getting quotes from multiple lenders is crucial for comparison and leverage. Borrowers have less negotiating power with fixed costs like recording and credit report fees, but can ask to roll them into the loan. Preparation, comparison, and respectful communication are key to successful negotiation.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen above 4%, despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth. The 10-year Treasury yield's move higher comes even as traders raised their expectations for lower Federal Reserve rates on expectations for a weaker economy. Trump, along with his cabinet officials, have repeatedly highlighted their desire to bring down Treasury yields which they said would reduce the cost of borrowing. The tariffs have stoked fears of a global trade war, as countries respond with their own tariffs on the United States.</p>
