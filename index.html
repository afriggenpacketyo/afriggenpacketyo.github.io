          <p>Severe flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in at least 24 fatalities and a large-scale search for missing individuals. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, catching communities by surprise, with up to 25 children from a summer camp reported as unaccounted for. Officials have described the event as a "terrible" tragedy, deploying hundreds of rescue personnel, helicopters, and drones to assist in the extensive search and rescue operations. The region's lack of an early warning system has been highlighted as a critical issue following the disaster.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the scene of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics left seven people unaccounted for, and positive identification of the remains is still pending. The blast also triggered multiple grass fires and led to evacuation orders, with investigations now involving federal agencies like the ATF. It was also revealed that the facility, located on property owned by a county sheriff's lieutenant, lacked the proper local licenses for storing fireworks.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Independence Day to protest against recent immigration raids and increased federal funding for them. Marching through areas like Olvera Street and outside the Federal Building, participants chanted slogans such as "No more occupation! No more deportation!" Many protesters indicated they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to make their voices heard on the issue. The peaceful demonstration was monitored by police, while military personnel stood guard at the Federal Building, which houses the region's immigration court.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided loss ever at Dodger Stadium, an 18-1 rout by the Houston Astros. Former Astros player Jose Altuve and newcomer Christian Walker led the offensive onslaught, with both hitting multiple home runs and driving in several runs. The game was marked by a disastrous sixth inning where the Dodgers' pitching staff gave up ten runs, the most the team has allowed in a single inning since 1999. The defeat highlighted significant pitching struggles for the Dodgers against a surging Astros team.</p>

          <p>Recent UK political headlines focus on Chancellor Rachel Reeves's private warnings to the Cabinet that tax increases will be necessary after abandoning welfare reforms. This stance is reportedly more severe than her public statements, creating concerns about potential tax hikes for middle earners to fill a projected £40 billion fiscal gap. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first year in office receives mixed reviews, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticizing a "year of lies," while other outlets offer more balanced assessments of his performance on various policy fronts.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai is facing criticism for his administration's approach to commemorating World War II, which appears to de-emphasize the Republic of China's (ROC) historical roots on the Chinese mainland. Critics argue that by focusing on Taiwan's separate identity, the administration is honoring the ROC's wartime victory without fully acknowledging its pre-1949 history under Chiang Kai-shek. This reflects the ongoing political tension between promoting a distinct Taiwanese identity and recognizing the historical legacy of the ROC government that relocated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War.</p>

Policy experts clarify that this provides some tax relief but is not a full repeal of the tax on benefits.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in mitigating climate change through a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists calculate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. This discovery highlights the critical, yet overlooked, role these organisms play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

The fraudsters target unclaimed estates listed on a government register, produce fake wills naming themselves as heirs, and then claim the assets, often undervaluing properties to evade inheritance tax. The report details several cases where rightful heirs were cheated out of inheritances worth millions. The findings point to a systemic failure in the digital probate application process.</p>

          <p>A new dedicated NHS clinic has opened in the UK to help children struggling with ketamine use, as experts warn of a "perfect storm" of mental health issues and cheap, available drugs. The article shares the personal story of a young woman who began using ketamine at 16 to escape negative thoughts, leading to a severe addiction that nearly killed her. Chronic use of the drug can cause horrific abdominal pain and permanent bladder and kidney damage. The number of young people seeking treatment for ketamine problems has nearly doubled.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action has been officially proscribed as a terrorist organization in the United Kingdom after a High Court judge rejected a last-minute appeal to block the ban. The proscription, which is now in effect, makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following acts of criminal damage. Critics of the ban argue it is an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's recently signed legislation disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, particularly in certain states. The top 1% of households in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see the largest financial gains, with average tax cuts exceeding $100,000 annually. These states, which do not have state income taxes, allow their high-income residents to reap the benefits of federal tax reductions without being negatively impacted by the bill's cap on state and local tax deductions.

          <p>President Trump's major legislative package introduces significant changes affecting Americans' personal finances, from taxes to savings and loans. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, raises the child tax credit, and temporarily increases the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. It also creates new temporary deductions for auto loan interest and tip income, alongside deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The legislation also overhauls federal student loans and eliminates several consumer tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a final, last-ditch effort to block the deportation of eight migrants who had been held in Djibouti. This ruling followed a Supreme Court decision that cleared the legal path for their removal to South Sudan, a country with which the men have no known ties. Attorneys for the men had filed for a temporary restraining order, expressing grave concerns that the men could face torture or harm upon arrival. With the denial of this request, the Trump administration was able to proceed with the scheduled deportation flight.</p>

His involvement, which he claims was instrumental in securing the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, highlights the unconventional methods being used in the high-stakes effort to secure a permanent ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong support for a decade-old proposal from Warren Buffett aimed at curbing the national deficit. The idea, which Buffett framed as a simple "5-minute fix," is to pass a law making all sitting members of Congress ineligible for reelection if the federal deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. Musk reposted a clip of Buffett's 2011 interview with the words "100%" and "This is the way." The endorsement has renewed public discussion around the concept of enforcing fiscal accountability on lawmakers by directly tying their job security to budgetary performance.

The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year as part of a successful breeding season for the vulnerable species. Zookeepers distributed the eggs among different nests to improve the chances of survival, entrusting one to the first-time foster parents. Same-sex penguin pairings have been observed before, with both parents sharing incubation and feeding duties to care for their young.</p>
