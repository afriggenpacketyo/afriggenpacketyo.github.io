          <p>This article discusses Donald Trump's efforts to impose tariffs and the challenges his administration has faced. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs are easy, his attempts to overhaul the global economy through sweeping levies have been met with delays, exemptions, and market panic. A New York court blocked his trade policy, deeming it an overreach of presidential power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, though this decision is temporarily stayed pending appeal. The article highlights the confusion and uncertainty these legal battles create for businesses navigating the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines how manipulated images and disinformation spread online following a knife attack in Hamburg. A Syrian teenager, Muhammad al-Muhammad, who helped stop the attack became the subject of false narratives and AI-generated images aiming to discredit his heroism and undermine trust in the media. These posts often play into right-wing sentiments, portraying refugees as violent assailants. The article highlights the dangers of online disinformation and its potential to erode faith in factual reporting.

          <p>This article discusses the growing influence of US-backed conservative movements in Europe, exemplified by the CPAC conferences in Poland and Hungary.

The movement aims to reshape the European project, challenging the EU's liberalism and promoting anti-globalist policies. Despite some setbacks, the movement is gaining traction and seeks to establish Budapest as a hub for dissident European conservatism.</p>
