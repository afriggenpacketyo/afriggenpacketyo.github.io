          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Switzerland from May 9-12 to discuss de-escalating the ongoing trade war. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will represent China, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the United States. Experts anticipate that these negotiations will be protracted, potentially lasting several months, and will primarily focus on de-escalation rather than reaching a comprehensive trade agreement. Financial markets reacted positively to the news, with gains in mainland China, Hong Kong, and US stock futures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern over reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting raids targeting businesses and restaurants in Washington, D.C. CASA, an organization supporting working-class Americans, received specific warnings about ICE operations focusing on food businesses and delivery workers, purportedly under the pretense of beautifying the capital. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern about the potential impact on the local economy, emphasizing the significant role immigrants play in the restaurant workforce.

          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in Parliament that would allow judges to impose an additional two years of imprisonment on criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings in England and Wales. This legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide a sense of justice for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, have actively campaigned for this change. The bill has received support from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir last month, India announced that it had conducted strikes against "terrorist infrastructure sites" in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian Defense Ministry stated that the strikes targeted nine locations and were focused and non-escalatory, avoiding Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's military reported that the strikes killed at least eight people and injured 35 others, and announced a retaliatory attack, claiming to have shot down five Indian aircraft.

          <p>The United States and the Houthis in Yemen have reportedly reached an agreement to halt American airstrikes after the Houthis agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea, according to President Trump and Omani mediators. However, the Houthis have not declared a full cease-fire and state they will continue to fight Israel, leaving unclear whether attacks on other vessels in the crucial shipping lane will cease. The U.S. bombing campaign has cost well over $1 billion, and some U.S. military strategists are concerned it could undermine readiness for a potential conflict with China.</p>

          <p>Residents of the Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed in a January fire, are now eligible for federally funded debris removal. This decision reverses an initial exclusion and brings residents "one step closer to returning home," according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) cited the unique characteristics of the property and the presence of friable asbestos as justification for the inclusion.

          <p>The federal government is resuming collections on federal student loans in default for the first time in five years, implementing the Treasury Offset Program to collect income tax refunds and other federal payments. More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with an additional 4 million at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default should contact the Default Resolution Group for assistance with repayment options, including income-driven repayment plans and loan rehabilitation. The pause on collections was initiated during President Trumpâ€™s first term in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and extended by the Biden administration.</p>
