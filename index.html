          <h2>New U.S. Tariffs Threaten Economic Stability in South Korea and Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 22:21:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent imposition of additional tariffs on imports, particularly auto and steel exports, is poised to exacerbate economic slowdowns in key U.S. allies, South Korea and Japan. Both nations, heavily reliant on exports, are already grappling with a slowdown in growth, with Japan potentially facing a technical recession and South Korea's GDP growth estimates nearly halved. These new duties, including a 25% tariff on South Korean imports and an increased 25% on Japan, are projected to further depress their economic output. While markets currently remain calm, viewing these as negotiation tactics that might lead to a deal, the tariffs present considerable headwinds to growth if the countries fail to reach an agreement, adding to existing pressures from weak domestic demand.

          <h2>Cato Institute Challenges Trump's Emergency Tariff Authority in Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 22:19:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, has filed an amicus brief challenging President Donald Trump's use of emergency tariffs, arguing it oversteps executive power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The lawsuit contends that imposing steep tariffs on imports from countries like China and Mexico undermines the Constitution's separation of powers and expands presidential authority beyond congressional intent. The administration defends its actions by citing national emergencies like the fentanyl crisis and trade vulnerabilities, but the Cato Institute asserts there must be a limit to such broad powers. A lower court previously ruled against the president, and an appeals court decision is expected later this year, potentially setting a precedent for future presidential control over trade policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At 80 years old, legendary musician John Fogerty captivated the Hollywood Bowl with a powerful rock and roll performance as part of his “Celebration Tour.” Despite his age, Fogerty impressively maintained his vocal strength and guitar skills throughout the two-hour concert, performing 18 of 24 songs from his Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) era. The show also celebrated the return of his CCR song rights after a lengthy legal battle, a significant personal victory. A touching moment included Fogerty recounting the story of his lost and recovered 1969 Rickenbacker guitar, found by his wife after 44 years.

          <p>Four days after deadly flash floods ravaged parts of Texas, at least 161 people remain missing in Kerr County, including campers and staff from Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girls summer camp. Governor Greg Abbott confirmed 109 fatalities, with 94 in the Kerrville area alone, as extensive search and rescue efforts continue with the aid of Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters and reaper drones. Abbott emphasized that crews will persist until all missing persons are accounted for, despite fading hopes for finding survivors alive. The disaster has prompted questions regarding the adequacy of flood warnings and evacuation measures, with officials stating they underestimated the storm's unprecedented magnitude, which brought a "30-foot high tsunami wall of water."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer prices experienced a significant 3.6% year-on-year drop in June, marking the largest decline in nearly two years and indicating a deepening deflationary trend. This fall, worse than economists expected, reflects a pervasive price war across the economy amidst tepid consumer demand. While the consumer price index edged up slightly by 0.1%, and core CPI rose 0.7%, suggesting early signs of recovery in consumer prices, the persistent producer price deflation, ongoing since September 2022, highlights the challenges in stimulating consumption. Policymakers have criticized excessive price competition, which has hurt business profitability, and pledged tighter regulations to address its impact, with profits at industrial firms plunging 9.1% in May.

          <p>In a unified stance against U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed 10% tariff on BRICS nations, Brazil and India have committed to tripling their bilateral trade flows. Trump recently asserted that the BRICS bloc, which he claims was established to harm the U.S. dollar, would face additional charges if its members continue their "game" and pursue "anti-American policies." This pledge by Brazil and India underscores a broader effort among emerging market economies in the Global South to strengthen their economic ties and reform Western-dominated international institutions. The BRICS group, now expanded to include several more nations, has not officially responded to Trump's hardening posture, but this trade vow signals a clear counter-strategy.</p>

          <p>A flash flooding emergency has been declared in Lincoln, New Mexico, following intense rainfall, leading to multiple rescue missions and reported fatalities. The National Weather Service confirmed a father and two children were swept away in floodwaters, with other individuals trapped and unaccounted for, though the exact number is unclear. Videos posted on social media show fast-moving water sweeping a home down a river and carrying a myriad of debris, inundating roadways. Around a dozen roads are closed due to debris, and cleanup efforts are underway after water receded. The area's increased vulnerability to flooding is partly attributed to burn scars from last year's wildfires, which left the soil unstable and more prone to flash floods.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. development sector undergoing significant dismantling and its foreign aid apparatus becoming more myopic, an opinion article suggests Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill the emerging global public goods gap. The article notes the recent high-profile debut of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong, contrasting it with the perceived decline of USAID. This shift, driven by Beijing's more proactive role in international development and expectations from the Global South, could elevate Hong Kong's prominence as a hub for global cooperation.

          <h2>Federal Immigration Arrests in Los Angeles Surpass 2,700 Amid Ongoing Operations</h2>

          <p>Federal arrests of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles have reached 2,792 since aggressive operations began over a month ago, according to Homeland Security figures. The Trump administration deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines, leading to heated protests and widespread condemnation from local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who called a recent sweep near a summer camp a "disgrace." Local leaders argue these operations terrorize immigrant communities, slowing business and forcing residents to stay home, creating chaos. The ongoing crackdown tests the limits of executive authority, with federal courts delivering setbacks to local and state challenges regarding the White House's enforcement powers and control over the California National Guard.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from "Tiger King," has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison and fined $55,000 for animal trafficking and money laundering. Antle admitted to illegally buying endangered animals, including chimpanzees, lions, and tigers, and laundering over half a million dollars to fund these purchases. Prosecutors highlighted his role in the black market for endangered species, while his lawyers argued for probation, citing his need to care for 150 exotic animals at his Myrtle Beach Safari. The judge, while acknowledging Antle's care for animals, noted he broke federal law. Antle apologized for his actions, which are likely the final legal chapter for the "Tiger King" figures.</p>

A petition with over 27,000 signatures criticizes Meta's AI-powered moderation system and its inadequate appeal process. While Meta has acknowledged issues with Facebook Groups, it has not commented on a wider problem, though South Korean officials indicate Meta admitted to wrongful suspensions there.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that copper imports will face a new 50% tariff, a decision following an investigation into the metal's impact on national security. This move aligns with Trump's broader strategy to protect American industry, mirroring the recently imposed 50% levy on steel and aluminum. Copper prices in the U.S. surged to a record high immediately after the announcement, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expecting the formal decision soon. While some in the industry await the final order for potential exemptions, critics, like the Cato Institute, warn that such measures help U.S. producers but harm the many more firms reliant on copper inputs. The announcement precedes broader tariff increases planned for August 1st, affecting various goods globally. (not investment advice)</p>

Netanyahu, however, stated that Israel's military campaign in Gaza is not yet complete, aiming to destroy Hamas's capabilities and secure hostage releases.

          <p>The deadly Texas flash floods, which caused hundreds of casualties and missing persons, have brought renewed focus on the Trump administration's staff cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS). While experts agree NWS issued timely alerts for this specific event, concerns are raised about future preparedness if cuts continue, potentially making models worse or lowering staffing levels further. The NWS has lost approximately 600 staff since February, impacting meteorologists and hydrologists, with some offices operating significantly understaffed. Critics argue that despite recent hiring allowances, such reductions jeopardize the nation's ability to respond to increasingly severe weather events, emphasizing that "too many lives are at stake."</p>

          <p>A former senior judge, Sir Brian Leveson, has recommended "fundamental" reforms to the UK's criminal justice system, including judge-only trials for certain cases like fraud and bribery, to prevent "total system collapse." With almost 77,000 cases awaiting trial in Crown Courts, leading to months or years of delays for victims and defendants, the proposals aim to shorten processes and reduce backlogs. Other suggestions include more out-of-court resolutions, a new Crown Court division with two magistrates and a judge for less serious offenses, and increased sentence reductions for early guilty pleas. While the Magistrates' Association welcomes the changes, some barristers argue that jury trials are essential for fair justice and should not be diluted, sparking debate over the future of the justice system.</p>

Despite not naming a specific medication, the ASA concluded the ad implicitly promoted such drugs to the public, violating its code.

CBI Chair Rupert Soames attributes this outflow to companies listing elsewhere, private equity buyouts, and investors shunning UK shares. He advocates for urgent action, including lighter regulation, better marketing, and incentives for investing in British firms. Soames supports cutting allowances for cash ISAs to encourage more stock market investment, emphasizing that such reforms are crucial to retain companies like ARM Holdings and prevent further departures of major UK businesses.
