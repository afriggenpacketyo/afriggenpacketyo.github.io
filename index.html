          <p>During Karen Read's trial for the alleged murder of Boston police officer John O'Keefe, O'Keefe's mother, Peggy O'Keefe, conveyed a powerful message through her body language, according to a body language expert. Peggy O'Keefe's expressions and demeanor in the courtroom indicated her strong dislike, distrust, and belief that Read was responsible for her son's death. The expert described Peggy O'Keefe's gaze as "stalker eyes," suggesting a protective mother's silent vow to watch and hold Read accountable, while Read's father has been seen mingling with supporters and the press, in contrast to the behavior of O'Keefe's mother. The relationship between O'Keefe and Read had reportedly been deteriorating in the weeks leading up to his death. </p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that falsely claim artificial intelligence can predict questions for the national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have launched a joint campaign to investigate and eliminate "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Some social media accounts and private tutors are also falsely claiming access to "top secret" information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers. The high stakes of the gaokao, which determines university placement, make students vulnerable to such scams.</p>

Despite a flurry of changes bringing some fight and finesse, Scotland ultimately lost to Austria. Andreatta emphasized that this transition will take time, suggesting a need for patience and a long-term approach to improving the team's performance. </p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2bn upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, faced enormous overspends and major delays, but is now complete with the removal of the last traffic cone. The upgrade included building almost 70 structures and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Since 1913, there has been a correlation between the political party in power and U.S. economic downturns. Historically, all Republican presidents, including Donald Trump during his first term, have overseen a recession that began under their watch. This does not necessarily imply that Republican policies are inherently detrimental to the economy, but it does suggest a potential risk. It's worth noting that economic downturns are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle (not investment advice).</p>

Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a discounted price. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households affected by the rising cost of rice.

          <p>CPAC, the US Conservative Political Action Conference, held large gatherings in Poland and Hungary, signaling a push for US-backed conservatives to gain mainstream influence in Europe. The conferences featured speakers who derided the European Union's Green Deal and complained of mass immigration and "gender and woke madness". The movement aims to reshape the European project with its own brand of conservatism, but has also endured setbacks in recent elections. The Trump administration appears to be repaying support received from nationalist leaders in Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax on remittances leaving the U.S. is expected to negatively impact Africans who rely on these funds. The tax, included in a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives, would levy a 3.5% charge on remittances made by non-U.S. citizens. Remittances are a significant source of income for many African economies, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. Experts predict migrants will seek alternative channels to avoid the tax, potentially reducing the overall flow of funds.</p>
