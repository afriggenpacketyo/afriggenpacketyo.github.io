          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the ban on bottom trawling in its offshore protected areas from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgent need to protect oceans from irreversible destruction, coinciding with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats across 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas. This move follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough and calls from MPs to ban destructive fishing practices in MPAs, and aims to balance environmental protection with the interests of the fishing industry.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% in May, marking the sharpest decline since February 2020, due to lingering effects of tariffs. Despite this, overall exports rose by 4.8%, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Imports also fell by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while China's total trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports of rare earths indicates Beijing's strategic use of export controls during trade negotiations, while volumes of cars and ship exports increased, and the imports of soybeans surged.

He outlines five steps towards authoritarianism: declaring an emergency, using federal agents against civilians, allowing warrantless arrests, creating detention camps, and eventually declaring martial law. Reich urges peaceful resistance and emphasizes the importance of federal courts and broad-based protests in combating what he sees as a threat to civil liberties. He warns that the infrastructure of a police state can be turned on anyone and calls for vigilance in defending against tyranny.</p>

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a visit to the United States for a sixth round of ministerial-level talks to seek concessions on tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The trip aims to address the serious impact of the tariffs on Japan's export-oriented economy, especially with a national election approaching. Despite previous discussions, the two sides have yet to find common ground, with Japan urging the Trump administration to remove the additional tariffs. Japan has presented proposals including joint supply chain efforts and streamlined safety rules, but the U.S. is expected to continue pursuing protectionist policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The Israeli government had previously stated its intention to prevent the vessel from reaching Gaza, asserting its military would use "any means necessary" to enforce a naval blockade. This action underscores the ongoing tensions surrounding access to Gaza and the enforcement of maritime restrictions. The interception of the aid ship is likely to draw international attention and criticism.</p>

Critics argue that President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard without consulting state and local leaders inflamed tensions. The military was ordered to guard federal buildings after days of protests against ICE operations, leading to numerous arrests and condemnation from politicians on both sides of the aisle.</p>

The new proclamation restricts nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran from entering the US. The ban also includes citizens of Haiti and imposes heightened restrictions on Venezuelans, raising concerns about racism and division. Unlike the first ban, this one does not revoke previously issued visas but will reject new applications unless they meet specific exemption criteria, with Trump citing terrorism and public safety risks as justification.</p>

          <p>India's $80 billion investment in coal-fired power plants is running into conflict with water scarcity, as many new projects are planned in water-stressed areas. This expansion risks exacerbating water shortages for residents and businesses, particularly in regions like Solapur. The government prioritizes power access, given the country's relatively low per-capita consumption, but faces a Catch-22 with limited water resources. While renewable energy investments are increasing, coal power will remain dominant, potentially leading to future conflicts over water resources between industry and local communities.</p>

The dog's owners claim Burmaster violated their constitutional rights by shooting Apollo without an imminent threat, seeking damages for emotional distress. The case raises questions about police accountability and the use of force, especially given Burmaster's history of fatally shooting animals.</p>
