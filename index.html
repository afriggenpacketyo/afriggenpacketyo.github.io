          <p>Nike reported a significant drop in quarterly profit due to its ongoing turnaround plan, but still surpassed Wall Street's low expectations. The company anticipates a new, substantial challenge from tariffs, estimating a $1 billion incremental cost in the upcoming fiscal year. To counteract this, Nike plans to further reduce its manufacturing presence in China, adjust its supply chain, and implement price increases. The company's stock rose after executives expressed confidence that business results will improve moving forward.</p>

          <p>NASA's Curiosity rover has discovered unusual geometric patterns, described as "boxwork," in the Gale Crater region of Mars. These formations are believed to have been created by groundwater flowing through bedrock cracks billions of years ago, leaving behind hardened, cement-like minerals. The discovery provides further evidence of ancient waterways on the planet and raises new questions for scientists about Mars's transition to a dry, cold desert. The rover continues to ascend Mount Sharp, analyzing different geological layers to understand the planet's past habitability.</p>

          <p>President Trump made a final pitch for his major tax-and-spending bill, but notably omitted the July 4th signing deadline he had previously set for Congress. The proposed legislation, which extends tax cuts from his first term and increases funding for immigration enforcement, faces significant opposition. Democrats have criticized the bill for its large cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, which could result in millions losing health insurance and benefits. The bill's path through the Senate appears challenging due to the controversy and potential legislative logjams.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a "cool block." The initiative, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. Research shows such urban areas can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener spaces, a problem worsening with climate change. This project serves as a potential template for other densely populated cities seeking to create more livable and cooler environments.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, amid declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, oversaw major divisions including North American sales and operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. His termination follows a 2022 internal investigation into his procurement of materials for a secret project for Musk. The move comes as Tesla's stock has underperformed this year and the company faces brand damage and increased competition from other electric vehicle makers.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared victory over Israel in his first public remarks since a recent ceasefire, claiming Iran had crushed the "Zionist regime." Despite these assertions, U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments indicate that joint strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, setting it back by years. Khamenei also claimed to have dealt a "big slap in the face" to the U.S. by attacking a Qatari airbase, though reports confirm the missiles were intercepted. An Iranian government spokesperson acknowledged that its nuclear sites sustained "serious damage" from the attacks.</p>
