          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged his new South Korean counterpart to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist economic "decoupling." The conversation reflects Beijing's efforts to stabilize relations with Seoul's new administration, which is viewed as more open to China than its U.S.-leaning predecessor. Both ministers affirmed a commitment to advancing their strategic partnership, particularly ahead of the upcoming APEC summit, signaling a potential reset in diplomatic ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that requires immigrants arrested by ICE to be detained without the possibility of bail. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release for those not considered a flight or safety risk. Advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing catastrophic harm by separating families and detaining individuals with deep community ties for extended periods.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver for a final season of eligibility to play for USC. The suit challenges the legality of the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. Wingfield argues the denial is anticompetitive and has deprived him of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) payday and a crucial opportunity to enhance his professional career prospects.</p>

The arrest, which shocked passengers, was the result of a months-long investigation by the Contra Costa County Sheriff's office, and the pilot is being held on $5 million bail.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is scrutinizing the constitutionality of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics used by ICE agents in Southern California. During a hearing, judges on the 9th Circuit questioned the legality of "roving patrols" and using criteria like race, location, or language as the sole basis for detaining individuals. The case follows a lower court's injunction that blocked these practices, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of federal immigration authority.</p>

The article uses his recent comments on starvation in Gaza, which he said he believed was real "based on television," as a prime example. This reliance on media, particularly cable news, makes the president highly susceptible to manipulation and raises serious questions about the basis for his administration's actions.</p>
