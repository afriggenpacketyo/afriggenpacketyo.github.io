          <p>A Texas river authority had just finalized a contract for a new flood warning system in Kerr County, with a kickoff meeting planned for mid-July. Tragically, the devastating flash floods that claimed over 100 lives struck before the system could be implemented. The nearly $73,000 project was intended to be a decision-support tool for emergency managers, providing real-time data on a centralized dashboard, but it was not designed to issue public alerts. In light of the disaster, officials have stated that the implementation timeline will be re-evaluated.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging that its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete based on their gender identity violate federal civil rights laws. The complaint argues these rules unfairly disadvantage female athletes and create a hostile educational environment, a claim Attorney General Pamela Bondi labeled as both "deeply unfair" and illegal. The legal action follows threats of fines and targets a 2013 state law, which California's governor insists is being followed correctly and is in line with policies in 21 other states.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a series of meetings with U.S. congressional leaders in Washington to discuss security cooperation and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. He met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, emphasizing the strong U.S.-Israel partnership under President Trump, particularly in countering Iran. Netanyahu stated that their joint efforts have created new opportunities for peace, but stressed the immediate need to defeat Hamas in Gaza and secure the release of all hostages before a different future can be realized for the region.</p>

          <p>A Texas family shared their terrifying story of survival after the Guadalupe River flooded their home in the middle of the night. Awakened by screams, Taylor Bergmann, his mother Erin Burgess, and her boyfriend were swept from their home by a torrent of water that had already overturned their granite kitchen island. The three, along with their dog, were pushed into a tree, where Bergmann held onto his mother as the current tried to pull them away. After an hour of clinging to the tree and praying, the water receded, and they discovered that everyone, including the boyfriend and pets, had miraculously survived.</p>

While this move signals a step towards normalizing travel in the region, the U.S. State Department continues to maintain a "Reconsider Travel" advisory for Israel due to the unpredictable security situation.</p>

          <p>In a tragic revelation, state inspectors had approved the written emergency plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a devastating flood on the Guadalupe River killed dozens of campers and staff. While records show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, the specifics of the plan and why it failed remain unclear, especially since the National Weather Service had issued a flood watch over 12 hours prior. The camp did not relocate its 650 attendees to higher ground, unlike another nearby camp, leading to immense tragedy when the river surged 15 feet in just one hour.</p>

Other recommendations include exploring temporary payment pauses like deferment for short-term hardship, looking into employer or state-based repayment assistance programs, and setting up autopay to receive a small interest rate discount from servicers.

          <p>The new HBO documentary "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter, actor Mariska Hargitay, offers a reassessment of Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield's legacy. The film challenges the common perception of Mansfield as merely a copy of Marilyn Monroe, instead portraying her as a talented and intelligent woman with serious acting ambitions. It explores how she strategically navigated the restrictive 1950s studio system, using her bombshell persona as a means to an end, even as it ultimately typecast her and prevented her from achieving the dramatic roles she desired.</p>

          <p>Gymnast and social media influencer Olivia "Livvy" Dunne was denied the purchase of a $1.6 million New York City apartment that was once home to baseball legend Babe Ruth. Dunne revealed on TikTok that despite having an accepted offer and planning to pay in cash, the building's co-op board rejected her application just a week before she was supposed to get the keys. The listing agent confirmed the rejection but stated no reason was given, leaving Dunne to speculate whether it was due to her public profile or even her LSU allegiance.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump allocates approximately $170 billion towards immigration enforcement, providing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with its largest-ever pool of funding. The legislation includes $75 billion in supplemental funds for ICE, which will be used to dramatically expand its detention capacity to potentially hold over 100,000 people and to hire thousands of new deportation officers. This massive financial infusion is set to supercharge the Trump administration's promised campaign of mass deportations across the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the war, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at targets in western Ukraine overnight. The attack primarily focused on the Volyn region, which borders Poland. In response to the massive barrage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for more "biting" sanctions against Moscow's energy sector. Concurrently, the United States announced it would reverse a recent pause on delivering Patriot air-defense systems to Kyiv, a move aimed at bolstering Ukraine's ability to defend against such large-scale attacks.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are actively planning for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump later this month, which would require a significant security operation. Trump is expected to travel to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire to open a new course.

          <p>The Volkswagen Group announced a 47% increase in the sale of its electric vehicles in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, with 465,000 units sold globally.

However, the company faced regional challenges, with expected declines in North America, partly due to U.S. tariffs, and a one-third drop in EV sales in China's highly competitive market. Overall global deliveries for the group saw a slight increase of 1.3%.</p>

          <p>An earthquake swarm has been detected at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano since 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that hundreds of small earthquakes have occurred since early Tuesday, though they are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause any damage. Scientists believe the swarm, which is likely to continue for several days, is not connected to recent warm temperatures but is probably caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the volcano's magma chamber.</p>

          <p>This analytical article explores the dynamic between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting their relationship is a partnership of mutual convenience. Trump is driven by a desire for a significant foreign policy achievement, such as a Gaza ceasefire, which he believes could lead to a Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu, in turn, requires indispensable U.S. support for Israel's security, especially in countering Iran. This codependence creates a complex situation where Netanyahu must balance giving Trump a political win while pursuing his own narrow security objectives for Israel.</p>

Instead, factors like the ability to speak English, the presence of family and community ties, and a general perception, often promoted by smugglers, that the UK is a good and fair place to live appear to be more significant drivers.</p>
