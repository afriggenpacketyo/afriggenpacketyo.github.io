        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strengthened ties with President Trump, leading to a comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the US. This deal marks a significant political victory for Starmer, affirming the 'special relationship' between the two nations, even though the exact terms are still being discussed and could cause some internal strife. The agreement, announced by Trump on social media, aims to solidify the economic and diplomatic bond between the countries for years to come, potentially helping to stabilize Britain's economy amid faltering growth. The article suggests the deal may force Britain to choose between aligning with the US or the EU, which British officials dismiss as a false choice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Minister John Swinney of Scotland has announced his opposition to a bill that would allow assisted dying for terminally ill individuals. Swinney cites his religious faith as a significant factor in his decision, expressing concerns that the legislation could alter the doctor-patient relationship and potentially pressure vulnerable individuals to end their lives prematurely. The bill, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, requires patients to be terminally ill and mentally fit, as determined by two doctors, before they can request medical assistance to end their life. Swinney's stance may influence undecided MSPs, particularly within his own party, as the Scottish Parliament prepares to vote on the bill.</p>

          <p>An ongoing Israeli military operation in the northern West Bank has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians, with recent demolitions in Tulkarm causing widespread panic. Israel informed the Palestinian Authority of plans to demolish dozens of buildings, leading residents to believe they will not be returning to their homes. The military claims the demolitions are intended to improve accessibility for Israeli forces and prevent militants from regrouping, but many Palestinians fear Israel aims to transform refugee camps into regular neighborhoods.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting noncitizens to Libya without due process would violate a previous court order. The ruling came after lawyers representing a group of migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent their deportation to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing press reports and migrant accounts. The judge clarified that any imminent removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would defy the preliminary injunction barring deportations to countries other than their origin without allowing them to raise safety concerns.

Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have stressed the importance of soft power in foreign policy. However, scholars note that Nye's policy influence was limited and his attitude towards China was not always as friendly as some believed.</p>

The decision coincides with an expected trade deal between the UK and US, which is expected to reduce uncertainty.
