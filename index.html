          <p>In East Hollywood, a driver intentionally plowed a car into a crowd outside The Vermont music venue, injuring at least 30 people, with several in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after the individual was reportedly removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted them, during which an unknown individual shot the driver.

          <p>During a concert in San Francisco, pop star Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with a prop while performing her song "Roar." The mechanical butterfly she was riding while suspended over the audience suddenly dropped a few feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued the performance without further incident, flying through the arena before landing safely back on stage. The event is part of her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts, and she handled the malfunction with professional composure.</p>

The lawsuit names the publisher, its parent company, the reporters, Murdoch, and the Dow Jones CEO as defendants. Dow Jones has expressed full confidence in its reporting and stated it will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Actors Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell revealed their unique approach to finances after 18 years of marriage, stating that they keep their money completely separate. They contribute quarterly to a shared "community pot" for family expenses, adjusting their contributions based on who is working more at the time. This system supports their decision to always have one parent at home with their twin daughters. The couple also reflected on handling public commentary, particularly regarding Romijn's ex-husband John Stamos's memoir, with a focus on protecting their children from negativity.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a thrilling performance during the third round of the Open Championship at Portrush, electrifying the home crowd.

This moment generated one of the largest roars of his career and propelled him back into contention. Finishing with a round of 66, he sits six shots behind the leader but remains hopeful, giving himself what he calls "half a chance" for a victory.</p>

Lawyers and human rights advocates point to systemic flaws, including an incomplete medical database and formalistic examinations, leading to the enlistment of individuals who could be a danger to themselves and their units.

          <p>This article reflects on the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler, led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," was a coup attempt by a group of high-ranking military and administrative officials who had become convinced that killing the dictator was necessary. Although the bomb failed to kill Hitler and the coup was swiftly crushed, the event has become a powerful symbol of German resistance against the Nazi regime. Historians note the conspirators' complex motives and that they were not necessarily democrats, but their actions demonstrated a courageous defiance of tyranny.</p>

          <p>A fundraiser for the victims of a tragic school coach crash in Somerset has raised over £23,000, as the community of Minehead rallies in support. The crash, which occurred on the way back from a school trip, killed a 10-year-old boy and left multiple children and adults hospitalized. The coach, carrying about 70 people from Minehead Middle School, overturned on a hill near Wheddon Cross. The funds are intended to provide urgent financial and emotional support for the families and individuals directly impacted by the devastating incident.</p>

          <h2>Top Golfers Criticize Open Championship's Inconsistent Slow-Play Enforcement</h2>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's handling of slow play at the Open Championship after both were warned by officials during the third round. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being pushed for being a few minutes over the allotted time on Saturday, when the first two rounds ran significantly longer without issue. DeChambeau, who called the pace of play "out of control" earlier in the tournament, advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player. The criticism follows a controversial slow-play penalty issued to Shane Lowry a day earlier.</p>

          <p>According to hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to reach food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, killing 32 people. The incidents occurred near centers operated by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was established as an alternative to UN aid distribution. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones as people massed near the sites. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" at suspects who approached its forces and ignored calls to stop, while the GHF claimed the incidents happened far from its locations.</p>

          <p>Russia has continued its intensified bombing campaign against Ukraine, launching a massive overnight attack involving over 300 drones and more than 30 cruise missiles. The barrage killed at least one person in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, where a residential building caught fire, and damaged critical infrastructure in the Sumy region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the scale of the assault, which is part of a pattern of increasingly large-scale attacks by Russia. This relentless aerial bombardment continues to challenge Ukraine's defenses and dashes hopes for an imminent end to the war.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Generation Life, a faith-based group of Gen Z activists who spent a weekend on the Jersey shore advocating for chastity until marriage. The activists engage beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, framing chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity in an era dominated by social media's superficiality. They aim to connect with their peers by discussing shared anxieties about modern dating and the pressure to perform sexually. The group's mission is to offer an alternative path focused on deeper, more intentional connections, rooted in their Christian faith.</p>

          <p>This article features Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old who left her career in 2020 to travel the world and now lives full-time in a custom-renovated Toyota Tacoma truck. After selling her house, she invested over $50,000 to outfit the vehicle for "overlanding," a form of self-reliant travel to remote destinations. She is currently journeying the Pan-American Highway, spending an average of $1,305 per month on expenses like gas and food. Kaye finds the lifestyle liberating, allowing her to set her own pace, though she notes the logistical challenges of solo travel and crossing borders.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These parties are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, adopting rhetoric similar to Western nationalist movements. While Japan faces significant labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these groups advocate against relying on foreign workers and call for a "Japanese First" policy. Their platform resonates with voters concerned about economic struggles and the preservation of cultural norms, creating a contentious political climate.</p>

          <h2>Fatal South Africa Building Collapse Was 'Entirely Preventable,' Government Report Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in George that killed 34 construction workers last year was "entirely preventable." The investigation found that multiple red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, but work on the five-story apartment block continued. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and victims' families continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>
