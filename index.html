            <p>Military planners have been deployed to Birmingham to help manage the ongoing bin strike, which has resulted in significant rubbish accumulation across the city. The strike, involving refuse workers from the Unite union, has been ongoing for a month, prompting the city council to declare a major incident. While soldiers are not being used to collect rubbish, military planners will provide logistical support. Striking workers are set to vote on a "partial deal" to end the dispute.</p>
