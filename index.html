            <p>Prince Harry made an unannounced visit to Ukraine, meeting with war victims at the Superhuman Centre in Lviv. The Duke of Sussex, accompanied by members of the Invictus Games Foundation, spent time with wounded military personnel and civilians undergoing rehabilitation. Lviv has been a frequent target of Russian missile attacks, adding a layer of risk to the visit, which was only revealed after Prince Harry had left the country. The visit highlights Prince Harry's continued commitment to supporting veterans and those affected by conflict.</p>

            <p>A recent CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll reveals that financial stress is increasing among Americans across all income levels, with nearly half reporting higher stress compared to a year ago. Inflation, high interest rates, and potential layoffs are major contributors to this anxiety, impacting even those earning six-figure incomes. Discretionary spending is declining as households allocate more of their budget to essential expenses, leading to a sense of financial insecurity. While some remain optimistic about future improvement, concerns about the economy and tariffs persist.</p>

            <p>Experts are raising concerns that the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act could create barriers to voter registration for married women who have changed their last names. The bill, which requires documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, may disproportionately affect women whose current names do not match their birth certificates. Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters. Supporters of the bill claim it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting, though instances of noncitizen voting are rare.</p>

Analysts emphasize that the impact of tariffs on bank financials will be a key area of focus during earnings calls. Investors are particularly interested in management commentary on economic health, interest rate expectations, and the pipeline for dealmaking activities. The near-daily barrage of tariff headlines has been ongoing for months, so the reported quarter could certainly be impacted -- but, it's what banks forecast for the quarters ahead and the full year that investors care most about.

            <p>President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend his administration's reciprocal tariffs was influenced by a negative reaction from the bond market. Bond prices slid and yields on 2-year Treasury notes rose sharply, signaling investor concerns about the tariffs' impact on the economy. Experts warned that the tariffs raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. The bond market's hostile reaction, coupled with concerns about the potential impact on the nation's finances, prompted the administration to pause the tariffs.</p>
