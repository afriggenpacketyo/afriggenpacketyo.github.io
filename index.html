          <p>The White House has named Mary "Maggie" Cleary as the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, an office currently investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James. Cleary, a conservative lawyer, replaces Erik Siebert, who resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration to bring charges against James. The appointment comes during a period of turmoil for the office, with Cleary herself having previously written about being politically targeted in connection with the January 6th Capitol riot. This move places a prosecutor aligned with the administration in charge of a politically contentious investigation.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including senior CIA officials, without first consulting the White House, causing significant internal frustration. The move was reportedly part of a broader Trump administration effort to target officials involved in the 2016 intelligence assessments on Russian election interference. According to the article, the lack of coordination blindsided White House officials and has deepened existing tensions between Gabbard's office and the CIA, highlighting ongoing turmoil within the U.S. intelligence community.</p>

This arrangement is designed to resolve long-standing national security concerns regarding the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, following a U.S. law requiring its divestment. Under the proposed deal, tech giant Oracle will take the lead on managing data and privacy for TikTok's 170 million American users, marking a pivotal step in the app's future in the United States.</p>

By using powerful lasers to compress the capsules, researchers were able to collapse the diamond's rigid atomic structure, a key step in understanding how to achieve the symmetrical implosion required for nuclear fusion. This breakthrough provides critical data that could accelerate the development of fusion as a clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy source, potentially reducing global dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense, recently renamed the Department of War by the Trump administration, has implemented new regulations that severely curtail media access and reporting within the Pentagon. Under the new rules, journalists will require official escorts in most areas of the building and must sign a document agreeing not to publish any information, even if unclassified, without prior official approval. Press freedom organizations have vehemently condemned these measures as a direct assault on independent journalism and government transparency, arguing it will prevent the public from receiving unvetted information about the military.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration demonstration organized by a right-wing group in The Hague, Netherlands, erupted into violence, with rioters clashing with police just weeks before the country's general election. Protesters threw objects, set a police car ablaze, and vandalized the office of a centrist political party, prompting police to deploy tear gas and a water cannon. Dutch political leaders from across the spectrum have strongly condemned the violence, describing it as a completely unacceptable attempt to intimidate opponents and disrupt the democratic process.</p>

They argue that the facility has the capacity, low operational costs, and effective rehabilitation programs to help alleviate severe overcrowding in the state's county jail system. The state's decision to shutter the prison was based on projections of a declining inmate population and the significant investment required to update the aging infrastructure of the facility.</p>

Since Indian nationals are by far the largest group of H-1B visa recipients, the sudden policy change has created significant uncertainty for professionals and businesses alike. While the White House has clarified the fee applies only to new applicants, the move adds friction to the already tense trade negotiations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can appear in subtle forms, such as ignoring a partner's presence, or in more overt ways, like devaluing their priorities and identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that mutual respect is a foundational ingredient for any relationship to survive and thrive, as it fulfills the fundamental human need to be seen and valued.</p>
