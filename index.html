          <p>The CEOs of major companies, including Uber, Dell, and Goldman Sachs, are expected to announce multi-billion dollar investments into 'Trump accounts' for newborns. This initiative, part of President Trump's pilot program, aims to deposit $1,000 from the government into investment accounts for newborn Americans. The 'Invest America' roundtable at the White House will feature commitments from corporate leaders, with the goal of bolstering financial security for future generations. The provision passed the House as part of a budget bill and is awaiting Senate approval, facing some Republican pushback. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Referendums in Italy concerning citizenship and labor reforms are likely to fail due to low voter turnout, marking a victory for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who opposed the measures. With only about 30% of eligible voters participating, the referendums, which require a 50% plus one voter participation to be legally binding, are unlikely to pass. The referendums addressed workplace protections and easing citizenship laws for non-EU immigrants. Supporters hoped easing citizenship would address Italy's low birth rates and integrate foreign workers to boost the economy, but the low turnout signals a strengthening of Meloni's government.</p>

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, continue to spread across the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. These ants inject venom that can cause anaphylactic shock, posing a risk to individuals with allergies to bee and ant stings. The ants are small, sneaky, and capable of invading undisturbed forest areas, outcompeting native ant species and disrupting seed dispersal. Experts advise vigilance, especially in areas with logs and rocks, and recommend contacting local extension offices for identification and pest control.</p>

          <p>US and Chinese officials convened in London for trade talks aimed at resolving ongoing tariff disputes. Both nations had previously agreed to a temporary truce, but mutual accusations of breaching the deal have since surfaced. Key discussion points are expected to include China's exports of rare earths and the US access to Chinese products like computer chips.
