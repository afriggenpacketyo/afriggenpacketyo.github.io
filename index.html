          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 04:11:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts suggest that while the closure is unlikely, it would severely impact Iran's own oil exports, particularly to Asia, and could provoke regional hostilities. The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, with approximately 20% of the world's oil passing through it daily, and any disruption would affect global markets. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia notes that alternative pipeline capacity is insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions, exacerbating the impact on global energy supplies.

Law enforcement is deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites across New York City as a precaution.

Researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances.

Analysts suggest Russia has limited capacity to assist Iran due to its own military needs in Ukraine and the need to maintain relations with the U.S. Moscow's response has been muted, calling on Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>The government has announced a 10-year industrial strategy that includes measures to lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies. The plan aims to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses through a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme. Manufacturers will see reduced electricity prices, and the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut. The strategy also includes measures to speed up the connection of new factories and projects to the energy grid, with the goal of creating over one million new jobs over the next decade.

          <p>Despite becoming the most sanctioned nation on Earth following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience, even outgrowing all G7 nations in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by record military spending and the diversion of oil exports to China and India. However, as 2026 approaches, the Russian economy faces challenges including high inflation, soaring interest rates, and worker shortages. Russia's economy minister has warned of a potential recession, and oil and gas revenues have fallen due to sanctions and weaker pricing, leading to a widening budget shortfall.

          <p>A report details how middlemen are involved in importing unauthorized Chinese-made vapes into the United States. A customs brokerage firm near Chicago allegedly helped import millions of these illegal vapes, including brands like Lost Mary and Geek Bar, which the FDA has declared illegal. The FDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have seized millions of illegal vapes and sent letters to middlemen involved in the supply chain. The report highlights mismatches in customs data between the U.S. and China, indicating that unauthorized vapes are often disguised as other items.</p>
