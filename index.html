          <p>Former Disney star Christy Carlson Romano recounted a harrowing incident where she was struck by birdshot during a clay pigeon shooting outing with her husband. The actress, known for "Even Stevens" and "Kim Possible," revealed she was hit in five places, including below her eye, and narrowly avoided blindness or death. Romano emphasized the importance of gun safety and described her initial shock and fears for her children. Despite the trauma, she maintained a brave face and made jokes at the hospital, though she admitted it has been difficult to accept being a "gunshot survivor."</p>

          <p>Victoria McCloud, a transgender former judge, has voiced concerns that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts trans people at risk. She argued that the ruling, defining a woman by biological sex, could lead to dangerous situations, such as her having to use men's restrooms in potentially unsafe environments. McCloud is planning to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the court did not hear from trans people before its decision. She believes the ruling breaches her human rights.</p>

The Israeli military stated they fired warning shots at suspects approaching them in a threatening manner. The incident is likely to intensify international criticism of the new aid distribution model, which the UN insists endangers Palestinians and fails to provide adequate food and medicine.</p>
