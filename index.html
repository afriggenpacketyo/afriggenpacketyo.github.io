          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China is implementing a new economic strategy that focuses on developing its inland provinces, with Guizhou, historically one of its poorest, set to play a key role. Provincial leaders are aligning with a national plan to transform the region into a "strategic hinterland," leveraging its comparative advantages to support the country's overall goals. This initiative is part of China's 2026-2030 development plan, which aims to reshape the nation's economic and industrial landscape. The strategy seeks to build resilience and self-sufficiency in the face of external economic pressures.</p>

          <p>The White House and Senator Ted Cruz are pushing back against criticism that federal budget cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) contributed to the Texas flood disaster. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called such claims a "depraved lie," providing a timeline of NWS alerts to argue that the agency was adequately staffed and performed its duties. Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages impacted the agency's ability to provide timely warnings. Both sides agree on a future review of the response, but currently, the focus remains on the immediate recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose steep new tariffs on imports from at least 14 countries, set to take effect on August 1. The targeted nations include major trading partners like Japan and South Korea, which will face 25% duties, while others like Laos and Myanmar will see tariffs as high as 40%. The move comes as a 90-day pause on previously threatened "reciprocal tariffs" was set to expire, with the administration having secured few of the trade deals it had promised. The letters announcing the tariffs warn against retaliation and state the new rates are necessary to correct persistent trade deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seraphine, a high-end maternity fashion retailer famously worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, founded in 2002, faced significant trading challenges due to rising costs and fragile consumer confidence, leading to the majority of its staff being made redundant. Once popular enough to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, the brand is now being managed by administrators who are exploring options for its future, including a potential sale. The company's website is now inaccessible to shoppers after recently offering steep discounts on its products.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited his trade war by announcing new tariffs on numerous countries, including Japan and South Korea, scheduled to begin on August 1. This action follows a 90-day pause on more draconian tariffs announced in April, a period during which the administration failed to secure many of the trade deals it had sought. The move has created uncertainty in financial markets, which reacted negatively to the news. The legality of the tariffs, imposed under emergency authority, is also being challenged in court, adding another layer of complexity to the administration's unpredictable trade policy.

          <p>The UK government has announced a ban on using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will void such confidentiality clauses, a move championed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The campaign for this change gained momentum following high-profile cases where NDAs were used to cover up criminality, including accusations of sexual assault. This legal reform aligns the UK with countries like the U.S. and Ireland that have already enacted similar protections for workers.</p>

          <p>Anger over rising rents and gentrification has boiled over into street protests in Mexico City, with some demonstrators targeting Americans and other foreigners.

While Mexican leaders condemned the xenophobic tone of some protests, they acknowledged the legitimacy of the underlying housing concerns. Analysts note that the housing crisis is a nationwide issue with complex causes beyond foreign arrivals, but the demonstrations reflect growing social tensions in the capital.</p>

While the NWS has lost about 600 staff members, experts indicate that the forecasts and warnings for this specific event were adequate, with local offices surging staff as per protocol. However, some questions remain about whether staff shortages, particularly of roles that coordinate with local emergency services, may have created communication gaps. The White House maintains that the NWS was well-staffed and that all warnings were issued in a timely manner.</p>

The author contrasts Hassett's claims with the Congressional Budget Office's projection that 8 million Americans will lose their insurance. The piece highlights Hassett's history of inaccurate economic predictions, including his 1999 book "Dow 36,000," to question the credibility of the administration's optimistic forecast. The argument is made that significant spending cuts to a program providing healthcare can only be achieved by removing people from that program.</p>

Experts suggest that our innate sense of fairness and desire for human oversight play a significant role in this distrust.

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the "urban heat island" effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The project involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter, heat-reflective colors, and painting rooftops white. Research shows that such green infrastructure and reflective surfaces can significantly reduce peak urban temperatures, which are rising due to climate change. This "urban laboratory" provides a potential template for other densely populated cities looking for practical ways to combat extreme heat and improve living conditions for residents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to remove Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. The move comes months after the group, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, successfully overthrew the Assad regime, with al-Sharaa now serving as Syria's interim president. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited the new government's positive actions, including a commitment to disband HTS and combat terrorism, as the reason for the policy change. This decision follows the Trump administration's lifting of economic sanctions on Syria, signaling a significant shift in U.S. policy toward the country's new leadership.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven missing workers have been located following a series of deadly explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The facility, owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The state fire marshal and federal agencies, including the ATF, are investigating the cause of the Tuesday night blasts, which also sparked multiple grass fires. The coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through DNA testing, as families of the deceased wait for answers.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly praised Mom's Meals, a company that provides taxpayer-funded meals to Medicaid and Medicare patients, for helping make America healthy. However, an Associated Press review of the company's menu reveals that many of its offerings are ultraprocessed foods, containing chemical additives and high levels of sodium, sugar, or fat. This endorsement appears to contradict Kennedy's frequent public criticism of ultraprocessed foods and their role in chronic disease. Nutrition experts who reviewed the menu confirmed the meals are loaded with additives that would not be used in a home kitchen.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major U.S. physician associations and a pregnant doctor are suing the Trump administration over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recommendation against COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children. The lawsuit alleges that this guidance, issued without consulting scientific expert panels, ignores evidence of the heightened risk COVID-19 poses to pregnant women. The plaintiffs argue the administration's actions are part of a broader effort to promote anti-vaccine rhetoric and dismantle the nation's system of disease prevention. The suit seeks to challenge what they describe as an "existential threat to vaccination in America."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.75%, providing some relief for prospective homebuyers. While this is a welcome trend, experts are uncertain if the downward movement will persist through July. Future rate directions will likely be influenced by the upcoming inflation report and signals from the Federal Reserve's end-of-month meeting. Even without a formal rate cut from the Fed, lenders may begin to adjust their offers in anticipation of future economic shifts, making it a critical time for prepared buyers to monitor the market.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the rules surrounding wage garnishment, a legal process creditors use to collect debts by taking money directly from a person's paycheck. The duration of garnishment typically lasts until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid, which can take years. Federal law generally limits the amount to 25% of disposable income, but rules vary for different types of debt, such as student loans or taxes, which can have different limits and processes. Options to stop or reduce garnishment include challenging it in court, negotiating with the creditor, or, in some cases, filing for bankruptcy.</p>

The investigation also found no credible evidence that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals and reaffirmed the official finding that his death in prison was a suicide. The release of the memo has been met with disbelief and accusations of a cover-up by some of President Trump's supporters.
