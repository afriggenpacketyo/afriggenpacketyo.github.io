          <p>In response to the deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country, several disaster relief efforts have been established to assist victims and support first responders. Officials have promoted the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, managed by the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, for financial donations to aid local recovery. The grocery chain H-E-B is deploying a mobile kitchen to feed those in need, while organizations like the American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen are on the ground providing shelter, supplies, and mental health support. These initiatives offer avenues for the public to contribute to the recovery of the devastated communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement 25% blanket tariffs on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The decision was communicated through letters to the leaders of both nations, ending a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs. The letters state the policy is necessary to address persistent U.S. trade deficits and warn against retaliatory measures, threatening to add any new foreign duties onto the 25% rate. The announcement prompted an immediate negative reaction in U.S. financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is bracing for potential new U.S. tariffs, a move economists warn could raise prices for consumers and disrupt trade on both sides of the Atlantic. President Trump has expressed displeasure with trade talks and threatened to increase the tariff rate on European exports to 50%, impacting a wide range of goods from French cheese to German electronics. In response, the EU has prepared retaliatory tariffs on American products, including beef and airplanes. The article explores the significant trade relationship, valued at $2 trillion in 2024, and the potential economic fallout of an escalating trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw has publicly criticized the Pittsburgh Steelers for their management of former quarterback Kenny Pickett, who was traded after just two seasons. Bradshaw argued that the organization failed to provide the 2022 first-round draft pick with adequate support, specifically citing a weak offensive line and a lack of high-caliber offensive weapons. He contended that Pickett was not a failure, but rather the Steelers' system and roster construction failed him. Bradshaw's comments reflect his belief that a team must build a strong roster to ensure the success of a young quarterback.</p>

Analysts warn that the proliferation of such controls, often symbolic and politically motivated, erodes one of the EU's most tangible achievements.

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory in the third stage of the Tour de France, edging out Italy's Jonathan Milan in a photo finish. The 178.3km stage from Valenciennes to Dunkirk was marked by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Despite the chaotic finish, which also involved general classification contenders Remco Evenepoel and Geraint Thomas, Mathieu van der Poel successfully retained the overall leader's yellow jersey. Top favorites Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard also finished safely within the main pack.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals that handgun carrying among Florida adolescents has increased by 65% between 2002 and 2022. The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, found the rate rose from 3.7% to 6.0%, with notable increases among female, middle school-aged, and white students. While general handgun possession is up, the study surprisingly found that carrying a handgun in school decreased by 60% during the same period. The findings highlight a growing public health concern, as firearms are the leading cause of death for U.S. teens.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Paper Indicates Risk of a Return to Near-Zero Interest Rates Remains Significant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:02:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new research paper from the New York and San Francisco Federal Reserve banks suggests that the possibility of U.S. interest rates returning to near-zero levels in the coming years is still a significant risk. Co-authored by New York Fed President John Williams, the paper notes that while the risk is currently at a lower point than in the past fifteen years, elevated economic uncertainty keeps the long-term probability high. A return to such low rates, historically associated with economic crises, poses challenges for the central bank's ability to provide stimulus without resorting to unconventional measures like large-scale bond purchases.

          <p>Formerly a tropical storm, Chantal has caused record-breaking floods, at least one death, and widespread power outages after making landfall in the Carolinas. A woman in Chatham County died after her vehicle was swept away by floodwaters, and emergency crews across central North Carolina have been overwhelmed with water rescues and search efforts. The storm brought up to 9 inches of rain to some areas, causing the Eno and Haw rivers to rise to historic levels. Several counties have declared states of emergency as the storm continues to move northeast, posing a continued flood threat to the mid-Atlantic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." In a social media post, Trump called the move "ridiculous" and said Musk had gone "completely off the rails," suggesting that third parties only create disruption and chaos. The announcement from Musk follows a public falling out between the two figures over a tax and spending bill that ended electric vehicle tax credits. This development marks a significant souring of the previously symbiotic relationship between the president and the Tesla CEO.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a provision in a new domestic policy bill that eliminates its access to Medicaid funding. The complaint, filed in Boston, argues that the provision is unconstitutional and is designed specifically to punish the organization due to its role in the public debate over abortion. The lawsuit contends that stripping Medicaid reimbursements from its nearly 600 health centers would have catastrophic consequences for the more than one million patients they serve annually through the program.</p>

          <p>The Grand Hôtel Oloffson, a historic and culturally significant landmark in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, was burned down by gangs over the weekend. The iconic Gothic gingerbread hotel, which had inspired novels and hosted international figures, had been closed due to escalating gang violence but was a symbol of Haitian culture and resilience. The destruction of the hotel, which once served as a presidential palace and a hub for artists and intellectuals, is being mourned as a profound loss of national heritage. The incident is symbolic of the broader destruction of Haiti's culture amid the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>A CNBC special report, "America's Deficit Reckoning," explores the severe risks associated with the rapidly growing U.S. national debt. Interviews with prominent economists and officials, including Ray Dalio and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, highlight three areas of potential fallout: market instability, economic strain from inflation and reduced government spending, and diminished national security. The report notes that the U.S. deficit is exceeding 6% of GDP, an unusually high level not driven by war or recession. Experts warn that the country may have less than 20 years to correct its fiscal trajectory before facing a potential default or other severe consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film "F1" has become Apple's most successful theatrical release, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. The movie, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has out-grossed previous Apple-produced films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Its success is partly attributed to a strong partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total global earnings. Despite its high ticket sales, the film's large production and marketing budget, estimated between $300 and $400 million, means it still has a considerable way to go to achieve profitability for the tech giant.</p>
