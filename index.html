        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of people, particularly Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence to improve their online dating prospects, with usage increasing over 300% in the past year. AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler offer services such as crafting witty messages, providing objective advice, and even helping users navigate difficult conversations like ending communication. While these tools can boost confidence for those who struggle with writing, their popularity raises questions about authenticity in digital interactions. Experts suggest that AI should be used as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, genuine human connection to avoid misrepresenting oneself.</p>

          <p>While touring flood-ravaged central Texas, President Trump praised the response efforts from local and federal agencies as "incredible" and "heroism." The flash floods killed at least 121 people and left over 170 missing, prompting scrutiny over the timeliness of official warnings. When a reporter asked about the adequacy of the alerts, Trump dismissed the question as "evil," insisting that everyone involved did an admirable job under unprecedented circumstances. This reaction contrasts with his past criticism of disaster management in other states, highlighting his close political relationship with Texas officials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and civil rights attorneys allege that law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles are violating their own policies and state law regarding the use of less-lethal weapons during recent protests against ICE raids. Numerous protesters and journalists have reported suffering serious injuries, including amputations and facial fractures, from projectiles like rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. While the Sheriff's Department insists these tools are used only when necessary and after extensive training, lawsuits claim they are being deployed indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators. These events have renewed scrutiny of police tactics and eroded public trust, echoing similar controversies during the 2020 George Floyd protests.</p>

          <p>Over seven million people in the UK are facing hosepipe bans as the country experiences its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching 34.7C. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for much of England, warning of risks to the entire population, while wildfire warnings are in effect for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Water companies have imposed restrictions due to record-level demand for drinking water amid the prolonged dry and warm conditions. Health officials are urging the public to stay hydrated and avoid the heat, especially vulnerable individuals with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service positions as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. This move, which aims to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15%, is part of a broader plan to streamline what officials call a "bloated bureaucracy" by consolidating offices and shifting focus to foreign embassies. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the indiscriminate cuts could undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts. The reorganization also integrates the former U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) into the State Department, a contentious move that has drawn significant backlash.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the recent Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which killed 241 people on board and 19 on the ground, points to a sudden engine shutdown. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau revealed that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines moved from "run" to "cutoff" within one second of each other, causing an immediate loss of thrust just after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. The report did not determine why the switches were activated, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

The surge also triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further pushing the price upward.

The judge ruled that the state's claims regarding the app's "defective and dangerous features" were specific enough to proceed.

Senior Russian Navy figures have reportedly backed the move, with one former commander calling classic aircraft carriers "a thing of the past" and an ineffective weapon.

This trend is reflected in a higher unemployment rate for young degree holders compared to the national average.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to levy a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods, set to begin on August 1st, escalating trade tensions just as the two nations approach a deadline for a new trade agreement. In a social media post, Trump linked the proposed tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and existing levies on American dairy farmers. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded that his government will continue to protect its workers and businesses. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy by Trump, who has also threatened new levies against the European Union.</p>

The $TRUMP token, largely controlled by the Trump Organization, has become a central part of the family's crypto activities, generating significant revenue from transaction fees.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace is expected to lose its historic spot in the Europa League to Nottingham Forest due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules. The issue stems from John Textor's 43% stake in Palace through his company, which also has ownership in French club Lyon, who also qualified for the competition. UEFA has deemed that Textor has decisive influence, and since Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they retain the Europa League place, bumping Palace to the less prestigious Conference League. Palace missed a key deadline to alter its ownership structure and is now expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seating has been a key driver of margin expansion, and the goal is to offer more choices to cater to different customer needs. While specific details were not provided, potential changes could involve new fare types, such as a more basic business-class ticket without full lounge access or an enhanced suite with more amenities. The move reflects an industry trend toward maximizing revenue from high-demand front-of-plane seats.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators has sent a letter to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, cautioning him ahead of his planned trip to China. Senators Jim Banks and Elizabeth Warren urged Huang to refrain from meeting with Chinese companies suspected of undermining U.S. chip export controls or collaborating with China's military and intelligence services. The lawmakers expressed concern that the visit could legitimize these entities and involve discussions about exploitable gaps in U.S. regulations. The warning comes amid growing bipartisan consensus on restricting advanced AI hardware exports to China to prevent acceleration of its military modernization.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely driven by a sharp increase in receipts from customs duties. Tariff collections for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, following the administration's implementation of across-the-board tariffs on imports. This surplus helped reduce the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, although it remains 5% higher than a year ago. Despite the boost from tariffs, persistently high interest rates continue to challenge federal finances, with net interest on the national debt remaining one of the largest government expenditures.</p>

Meanwhile, Patel is said to be using polygraph tests to question senior FBI employees about whether they have said anything negative about him personally. The author contends these actions prioritize personal ego and political purity over national security, creating paranoia and corroding morale among dedicated public servants.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential payment clawbacks, seniors are exploring alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines three potential options for homeowners and those with savings to generate additional funds. These include reverse mortgages, which provide monthly payments from home equity for those 62 and older, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. For immediate needs, a personal loan can serve as a less expensive borrowing alternative to high-interest credit cards, providing a financial cushion. (not investment advice)</p>
