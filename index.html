            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide blackout, impacting 1.4 million customers and highlighting the fragility of its electrical system. The outage was attributed to a combination of factors, including a failure in the protection system and vegetation on a transmission line. LUMA Energy, the private power company responsible for power transmission, stated that restoring service to 90% of customers could take two to three days, prioritizing critical facilities like hospitals. The blackout sparked renewed criticism of the island's aging infrastructure and calls for more resilient energy solutions, with residents expressing frustration over frequent outages and high electricity rates.</p>

            <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) canceled $2.7 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American ideology on campus. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard is unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars and ordered the university to submit visa records. This action follows President Trump's decision to freeze federal funding and request the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status. The DHS action comes amid a broader federal crackdown on campus antisemitism following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.</p>

            <p>The UK's leading business groups have jointly called for urgent revisions to the government's Employment Rights Bill, expressing concerns that the proposed reforms could hinder economic growth. The bill aims to enhance workers' rights, including guaranteed hours and restrictions on zero-hour contracts, but businesses fear it will discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. While supporting the government's objectives of improving productivity and wages, the groups argue the bill's current form could damage employment and undermine economic goals. The government maintains the bill will deliver the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation and has consulted extensively with businesses.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" for the central bank, potentially leading to both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely result in higher prices and slower growth. The Fed is prepared to remain patient and assess the impact of the tariffs before making any changes to interest rates. Some Fed officials have expressed differing views on the potential impact of tariffs on the economy.</p>
