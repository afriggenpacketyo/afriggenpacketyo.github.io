          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla visited Canada, emphasizing Canadian sovereignty amid tensions with the U.S. The two-day visit included a welcome ceremony, a ceremonial hockey puck drop, and a tree planting. Prime Minister Mark Carney highlighted the bond between Canada and the Crown, forged over generations. The King and Queen met indigenous leaders, school children, and community groups, marking a rare occasion as the King is set to deliver the Speech from the Throne to Parliament, a task not performed by a monarch since 1977. The Queen wore a diamond maple leaf brooch that was given by King George VI to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in 1939 ahead of their first royal tour to Canada.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized President Putin's recent attacks on Ukrainian cities, describing them as "absolutely CRAZY," yet he has refrained from joining Europe in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or offering additional aid to Ukraine. Despite expressing shock over the attacks, Trump has not linked them to his decision to withhold further economic pressure on Russia. Experts suggest this creates a strategic void where Trump complains about Russian aggression without taking meaningful action to deter it. Trump's stance contrasts with calls from Ukrainian President Zelensky for increased economic sanctions to combat Russian impunity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union has provided temporary relief, but analysts caution that trade tensions remain high. The delay, until July 9, follows a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed readiness to advance talks. Despite this, significant differences persist, and market watchers warn of potential volatility. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding suggests a 10% tariff agreement is possible, while Guntram Wolff of Bruegel highlights uncertainty regarding Trump's specific demands.

The move has sparked controversy, raising questions about judicial independence and the protection of human rights. While the leaders say they aim to spark a conversation rather than immediate legal changes, critics argue it's a political act that undermines the rule of law. Experts also note that existing laws already allow for the deportation of individuals posing a security threat, and the issue is more about cooperation between member states and third countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools, citing concerns about antisemitism. The announcement follows previous actions to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard and its research partners. Trump accused Harvard of being slow to respond to requests for information on foreign student lists. The proposal has drawn mixed reactions, with trade school advocates applauding the idea while Harvard remains embroiled in legal battles with the White House.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic published an opinion piece discussing the rise of anti-Semitism in America, following the murder of two Israeli Embassy aides in Washington, D.C. The author argues that a deranged but coherent ideology is spreading through American institutions, dividing people into oppressors and oppressed, and embracing violence. The piece calls for a clear line against political violence and a reaffirmation that no political grievance justifies murder. It emphasizes the need to defend civic order and refuse to normalize an ideology that leads to bloodshed.</p>

          <p>A mobile prison is visiting schools in the U.K. to educate children about the realities of life behind bars. The project, led by former police officer Mick Amos, aims to deter youth from crime by providing a realistic glimpse into prison conditions. Students experience being scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted, and they spend time in replica cells. Organizers hope the experience will encourage tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, violence, and other issues, helping young people make informed choices.</p>
