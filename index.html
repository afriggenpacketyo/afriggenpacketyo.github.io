          <h2>Bryan Kohberger's Guilty Plea in Idaho Murders Leaves Motive Unanswered</h2>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students, avoiding a trial and the death penalty. This plea deal, however, leaves the central question of his motive unanswered, frustrating some victims' families who sought a public trial. The article explores the overwhelming evidence that led to the plea, including DNA, phone records, and a new eyewitness. Without a trial, the public is turning to a new wave of documentaries and books to understand the case, which suggest Kohberger may have been an obsessive stalker fixated on one of the victims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation to consider turning the state-owned Post Office into a mutual, employee-owned organization. This proposal has regained traction as a way to reform the institution's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal that led to wrongful convictions of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also examine the future services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking services, as it struggles with profitability. Proponents argue that a mutual model could prevent future scandals by giving staff a greater stake in decision-making. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old German doctor is on trial in Berlin, accused of murdering 15 of his patients with lethal injections between 2021 and 2024. Prosecutors allege the palliative care specialist acted with a "lust for murder," visiting patients under the pretext of providing care before administering deadly cocktails of sedatives. The case, which echoes other instances of medical serial killings in Germany, came to light after a co-worker grew suspicious. The doctor is also accused of setting fire to some victims' apartments to conceal his crimes.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged past $120,000 to a new record high, driven by significant inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional interest.

Analysts suggest that continued institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the near future, though potential risks from Federal Reserve policy and trade disputes remain.

          <p>A wildfire raging near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a landmark that had been operating since the 1930s. The lodge was part of dozens of buildings lost to the Dragon Bravo Fire, one of two major blazes that have burned tens of thousands of acres and forced the closure of the North Rim for the rest of the tourist season. Authorities believe the fires were started by lightning and fueled by high winds. No injuries have been reported, but the loss of the iconic lodge is a devastating blow.</p>

          <p>At least 30 people have been killed in southern Syria amid violent clashes between Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias in the province of Suweida. The violence reportedly erupted after the abduction of a Druze merchant and quickly escalated, with fighting spreading from Suweida city to surrounding towns and villages. Syria's interior ministry has called the situation a "dangerous escalation" and is deploying security forces to restore order in the chaotic security vacuum. Mediation efforts have reportedly led to some hostage releases, but fighting continues.</p>

          <p>Foreign leaders are developing a meticulous and shared strategy for interacting with President Donald Trump, based on an "alchemic mix of flattery, firmness, and personal flourishes." According to diplomats and officials, managing the mercurial U.S. president involves careful preparation, war-gaming scenarios, and sharing best practices to avoid disastrous meetings. This approach includes praising Trump publicly, as NATO's chief did, while also firmly advocating for their own national interests. The article details how leaders use personal gifts and appeals to Trump's ego to navigate his unpredictable style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains what Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is and examines its environmental impact amid its rebranding as "green" energy by some US states and the EU. Composed of over 90% methane, a potent greenhouse gas, LNG's climate footprint is significant due to leakages during its supply chain and the energy-intensive process of liquefaction and transport. While often touted as a cleaner "bridge fuel" than coal, some studies suggest LNG is worse for the climate over a 20-year period, undermining its classification as a green energy source.</p>

He pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine, terrorism, and cybercrime as key threats.

          <p>A growing healthcare movement known as "social prescribing" involves doctors writing prescriptions for community activities like exercise classes, art groups, or volunteering to improve patient health. This approach aims to complement traditional medicine by addressing chronic disease risk factors and social determinants of health like loneliness. By focusing on "what matters to you" instead of "what's the matter with you," it can lead to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs.

          <p>The definition of a "moderate" Republican is increasingly being applied to any lawmaker who deviates from Donald Trump's positions, as exemplified by North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Despite a long and solidly conservative voting record, Tillis was labeled a "Republican In Name Only" (RINO) after opposing a GOP bill over its cuts to Medicaid, leading him to announce his retirement. Political analysts note that this shift has less to do with traditional conservative ideology and more to do with loyalty to Trump, penalizing even minor dissent within the party.</p>
