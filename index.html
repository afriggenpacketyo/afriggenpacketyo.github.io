          <p>A former priest, Chris Brain, has been found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women who were part of an influential evangelical group he led in Sheffield during the 1980s and 90s. The 68-year-old was the head of the Nine O'Clock Service (NOS), where he was accused of sexually abusing women recruited into a team tasked with caring for him and his family. The prosecution detailed how these women were required to perform household chores and provide sexual favors. The jury at Inner London Crown Court acquitted him of 15 other charges and is still deliberating on several remaining counts, including one of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the head of President Trump's housing regulatory agency, has publicly called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign or be fired over allegations of mortgage fraud. Pulte claims to have evidence that Cook falsified bank documents and property records to obtain more favorable loan terms, prompting him to request a Department of Justice investigation. President Trump has amplified these calls, demanding Cook's immediate resignation in a social media post. This move represents an escalation of the Trump administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve and its officials, extending beyond previous criticisms aimed primarily at Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

Tropical storm warnings are in effect for coastal North Carolina and Virginia, with significant coastal flooding anticipated.

          <p>The New York Yankees achieved a remarkable feat by hitting nine home runs in a 13-3 victory against the Tampa Bay Rays, becoming the first team in MLB history to have multiple games with nine or more homers in a single season. The offensive showcase began in the first inning with back-to-back-to-back home runs from Aaron Judge, Cody Bellinger, and Giancarlo Stanton. Judge's home run was his 40th of the season, placing him in the elite company of Yankees legends like Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle. The dominant performance secured the team's fourth consecutive win and highlighted their renowned power-hitting capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has strongly criticized a U.S. appeals court decision that temporarily blocked a land transfer required for the development of a major copper mine in Arizona. In a social media post, Trump labeled the opposition from activists and the San Carlos Apache Tribe as "Anti-American," arguing the project is vital for the economy and national copper supply. The Resolution Copper mine, a joint venture between Rio Tinto and BHP, has faced years of legal challenges over its potential impact on sacred tribal lands and the environment. The tribe maintains the project will destroy a sacred area and threaten water rights, contrasting with the companies' claims of significant economic benefits.</p>

The memo accuses the officials of politicizing intelligence, failing to protect classified information, and other detrimental conduct, though no specific evidence was provided to support these claims. Many of the targeted individuals, some of whom have been critical of President Trump, left government service years ago. Critics, including national security lawyer Mark Zaid, have condemned the move as an unlawful and unconstitutional attempt to silence dissenting voices within the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a state law that would have required all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, Senate Bill 10, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses by amounting to unconstitutional religious coercion. The lawsuit was filed by a diverse group of families, represented by organizations like the ACLU, who argued the mandate infringes on their right to direct their children's religious upbringing. The ruling prevents the law from taking effect on September 1, with advocates hailing it as a victory for religious freedom and the separation of church and state.</p>

The department attributed the pause to court actions blocking the Biden-era SAVE plan, which affected how payment counts toward forgiveness are calculated.

She shared that while she is functioning, some days are more difficult than others, though she felt happy in the moment of speaking with her friend.

          <p>A 55-year-old man, Jason King, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting a police officer in the leg with a crossbow during a neighbor dispute in Buckinghamshire.

The incident, which also involved King stabbing a neighbor's partner, ended when an armed officer shot him. The judge described King's actions as an attempt to "hunt down" the officer and noted he posed a significant risk, while commending the bravery of the officers involved, who have since made full recoveries.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the entire U.S.-Mexico border wall will be painted black, a strategy she credited to President Trump's suggestion. The rationale is that the black paint will absorb heat, making the surface significantly hotter and more difficult for migrants to climb, especially in high temperatures. This initiative is part of a broader immigration crackdown that has seen border crossings plummet in recent months, which the administration attributes to its deterrent policies of sweeping arrests and detentions. The project is funded by a $46 million allocation for additional wall construction passed earlier this summer.</p>

In trials, bee colonies that consumed the new food produced up to 15 times more offspring that survived to adulthood.

While the percentage of daily readers dropped from 28% to 16%, those who do read are doing so for longer periods.

While the ruling does not end the nationwide use of hotels for asylum seekers, it opens a pathway for other councils to pursue legal action if they can provide evidence of similar harm.

The investment will enhance the production of key generator models that are paired with the company's heavy-duty gas turbines, which are reportedly sold out for the next several years. This expansion addresses the urgent need for more power-generating capacity as electricity consumption surges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unidentified flying object crashed and exploded in a cornfield in eastern Poland near the village of Osiny, causing windows to break in nearby homes but resulting in no injuries. Local residents reported hearing a loud bang that shook their houses, and police discovered burned metal and plastic debris at the scene. While Poland's military command reported no violations of its airspace from Ukraine or Belarus, the defense minister later stated the object was most likely a drone. Civilian and military investigators are examining the site to determine the object's origin and purpose, raising security concerns in the region near the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

Many potential buyers are waiting for both prices and interest rates to fall further before they feel comfortable entering the market.

          <p>According to an analysis from The New Yorker's Ruth Marcus, Attorney General Pam Bondi has overseen a significant transformation of the Department of Justice, aligning its operations with President Trump's political objectives. This reshaping has reportedly involved aggressively reversing previous policies, initiating investigations into President Trump's political adversaries, and dismissing staff members. The changes under Bondi's leadership are described as the most convulsive transition of power within the department since the Watergate era. This reflects a broader concern about the politicization of the institution and its departure from traditional norms of independence.</p>

This significant military escalation comes after ceasefire negotiations with Hamas stalled and has drawn condemnation from international allies and humanitarian organizations, who warn of a catastrophic impact on the region's 2.1 million people.

The chipmaker is in the midst of a challenging turnaround effort, grappling with declining sales and intense competition in the AI semiconductor market while investing heavily in its manufacturing business. This search for capital comes as the U.S. Commerce Secretary suggested that government CHIPS Act funding should come with an equity stake, a move that would be dilutive to current shareholders.

The recognition is intended to bolster the diplomatic efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) over the armed resistance of Hamas, thereby rewarding a commitment to negotiation.

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest percentage recorded in nearly 90 years of the survey. This decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of Americans now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. This growing skepticism is most pronounced among young adults but is also increasing across all age groups. The findings suggest that years of public health information linking alcohol to negative outcomes, including cancer, are influencing behavior and leading to lower consumption rates nationwide.</p>

However, the timing of this relief depends on the individual lender's adjustment schedule, which can be immediate, monthly, or quarterly.
