          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has been marked by rapid changes and a divisive political climate, with his administration facing criticism for its policies on Ukraine, immigration, and trade. Despite promises to end the war in Ukraine quickly, the conflict continues, and Trump's approach has strained relationships with Western allies. His immigration policies have also faced scrutiny, and his imposition of tariffs has raised concerns about the economy's future.

          <p>A fire at a port in southern Iran, triggered by an explosion, has been extinguished, with the death toll reaching at least 65. Satellite images reveal significant devastation, raising questions about the cause of the blast, which occurred during nuclear program negotiations with the United States.

          <p>Dozens of people were killed in an attack on a migrant facility in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen. The Houthi militia claims an American strike hit the facility, killing at least 68 African migrants. The U.S. military has conducted numerous strikes in Yemen since mid-March, targeting Houthi command-and-control facilities and weapons sites. Houthi officials claim that more than 100 civilians have been killed in recent strikes.</p>

          <p>Shares of Deliveroo soared after U.S. giant DoorDash made a $3.6 billion takeover bid. Deliveroo has confirmed receiving the cash offer and suspended its share buyback program. Deliveroo shares were up 16.5% to close higher on Monday. The company's board is considering the proposal and would be "minded to recommend" it to shareholders if a firm offer is made.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting operations targeting unaccompanied immigrant children, seeking to deport them or pursue criminal cases against them and their sponsors. The moves are sparking fears of a crackdown on these children and prompting alarm about what one critic called “backdoor family separation”. ICE is gathering intelligence to assess flight risk and public safety threats, with a focus on alleged gang or terrorist ties. Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been slashed, and data sharing between agencies has resumed.</p>
