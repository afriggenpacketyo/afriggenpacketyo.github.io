          <p>While a severe amber weather warning for London and southeast England has been lifted, the threat of flash floods persists across the United Kingdom. The Met Office has issued yellow rain and thunderstorm warnings for all four nations, cautioning about potential power cuts and travel disruptions. The initial fears of a month's worth of rain in a single hour did not materialize, but the ground, parched from a recent heatwave, remains less able to absorb water. Further yellow alerts are in place for the weekend and into Monday for various parts of England and Scotland.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out was later diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. The diagnosis was unusual as she never had a visible mole, a typical sign of this deadly skin cancer. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has led to what her doctor calls a "miraculous" improvement. Her story highlights the importance of investigating unusual lumps and the advancements in immunotherapy for treating late-stage cancer.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has dramatically deepened ties between China and African nations, leading to what officials call "leapfrog development." Since the forum's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly thirtyfold and Chinese investment has grown almost a hundredfold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by increased security cooperation, with China becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent and annually training about 2,000 African military officers. This growing influence positions China ahead of traditional partners like the US, Russia, and France in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced a significant reduction in its Military Working Equid program, with plans to put 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in parades, honor guards, and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, providing a living connection to military heritage. The Army has not used equids in combat since 1942 but values their stately presence in official ceremonies. This move is expected to save approximately $2 million annually, while the Army will retain enough animals for key ceremonial duties.</p>

          <p>The United States has taken a significant step toward regulating digital currencies with the House of Representatives passing the nation's first major crypto legislation. The "Genius Act," now signed into law, establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market where coins are backed by traditional currency. While supporters hail the move as a way to cement U.S. dominance in financial technology, critics worry the new rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying. A second bill, the CLARITY Act, which would shift regulatory power, now faces a more uncertain future in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A concept dubbed the "Gen Z stare" has gained traction on social media, describing a blank or unresponsive look from younger people in social or service interactions. While some Zoomers deny its existence, older generations recognize it, sparking a debate about declining social skills. Psychology experts suggest this behavior may stem from a combination of increased online interaction, where disengagement is simple, and the social isolation experienced during the pandemic.

However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to increase consumer prices on imported goods like toys and furniture. With an effective tariff rate at its highest since 1910, the long-term economic impact and risk of inflation remain significant points of concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months to live from paying council tax. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe income shock and increased costs, making council tax a significant burden. The exemption would provide crucial peace of mind and financial relief during an incredibly challenging time for patients and their families. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid discussions in France and Denmark about eliminating national holidays to boost economic productivity, this opinion article considers the idea in the U.S. context. The author argues that if a holiday were to be cut, it should be one with a problematic history, like Thanksgiving, rather than Juneteenth, which President Trump recently suggested was one of "too many non-working holidays." The article posits that Juneteenth is historically and economically significant, as the end of slavery led to massive economic gains. It suggests that Thanksgiving's historical narrative is flawed and that it is treated merely as a commercial stepping stone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California red-legged frog, a threatened species absent from Southern California for decades, is making a comeback thanks to an innovative conservation effort. Scientists translocated frog eggs from a healthy population in Mexico's Baja Peninsula to prepared sites in California. After years of waiting for signs of breeding, researchers successfully used a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings, detecting the frogs' mating calls. This technological breakthrough confirmed the re-introduced population is now breeding, marking a major success for the species' recovery and showcasing AI's potential in wildlife conservation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that for Democrats to regain support from non-college-educated voters, they must change their campaign messaging to focus on economic issues. The author contends that while defending democracy is important to the party's base, kitchen-table concerns like inflation and cost of living are paramount for the working class. The suggested strategy involves highlighting how Trump's policies, such as tariffs and budget cuts to programs like FEMA, negatively impact ordinary Americans while benefiting corporations. The piece urges Democrats to adopt a narrative centered on economic stability, small business support, and patriotism to build a winning coalition.</p>

According to the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, this decline reflects a growing crisis of governance. Issues contributing to the public's dissatisfaction reportedly include a divisive series of public talks and Lai's support for citizen-led mass recall campaigns against opposition lawmakers. The foundation's chairman described the current situation as one of the president's "worst moments" since his inauguration.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest to protect the threatened northern spotted owl is facing significant opposition. A coalition of Republican lawmakers and animal rights advocates argues the cull is inhumane, expensive, and unworkable. In a potential setback for the plan, federal officials recently canceled several related grants, and Congress may seek to reverse the decision entirely. Supporters of the cull, including conservation groups, maintain it is scientifically necessary to prevent the extinction of the spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl.</p>

This highlights a persistent disconnect where alerts for floods or extreme fire danger are issued but not always heeded, sometimes due to public complacency or apathy.

          <p>As the market for high-protein snacks grows, nutrition experts advise consumers to be discerning about marketing claims. Many products labeled "high-protein" may also contain significant amounts of sugar or be highly processed. Experts suggest a simple calculation: a food can be considered high in protein if 30% or more of its total calories come from protein. They also recommend checking the nutrition label for added sugars and prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or nuts. These alternatives often provide a better balance of nutrients without the unhealthy additives found in many packaged goods.</p>
