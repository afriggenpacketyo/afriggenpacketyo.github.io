          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This policy change aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, according to an Education Department spokesperson. The pause provides older student borrowers more time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed judge in California has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling applies to migrants in custody in the Central District of California and stems from a case involving a Venezuelan man detained due to his tattoos. The judge determined that the government failed to provide sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation under the act. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states reaching different conclusions.</p>
