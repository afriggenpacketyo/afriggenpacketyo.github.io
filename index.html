          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief dubbed the "Devil in the Ozarks," was apprehended near the Calico Rock prison in Arkansas, almost two weeks after his escape. Hardin, who was serving time for murder and sexual assault, had donned a law enforcement-like uniform to facilitate his escape. Law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Border Patrol and tracking dogs, located Hardin a short distance from the prison, confirming his identity through fingerprint analysis. Hardin was initially imprisoned in 2017 for fatally shooting James Appleton and was later sentenced for the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher. The authorities have confirmed that there is no longer an active threat to public safety.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely to target airbases, provides important insights into modern warfare. This innovative approach, bypassing the need for long-range missiles, surprised Moscow and served as a wake-up call for militaries globally. The attack demonstrated the vulnerability of seemingly secure locations and the potential of asymmetric warfare, with a Chinese military analyst noting that such tactics could be employed by secret services or in special military operations. The lesson for China is the need to enhance security measures to protect military bases from infiltration and similar attacks.</p>

          <p>After interviewing parents of highly successful children, the author identifies five key factors that contributed to their children's achievements. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing that learning and empowerment can occur anywhere, nurturing a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being overly critical. The research emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel encouraged to explore their interests and develop a positive outlook. The study also notes that parents often underestimate their children's capabilities and the value of everyday learning experiences.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is leading the Trump administration's efforts to carry out a large-scale deportation campaign. Since taking office, Noem has revoked several Biden-era policies and enlisted local law enforcement to expand deportation operations. She has also been involved in legal clashes and has faced criticism for her high-profile surrogate role, including incidents where she has been seen touring the southern border and meeting with world leaders. Despite the administration's claims of targeting dangerous criminals, the campaign has ensnared legal residents and even U.S. citizens.</p>
