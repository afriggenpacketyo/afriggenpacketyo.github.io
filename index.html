          <p>UK mobile network EE has confirmed it is working to resolve a second technical fault within a week that has left numerous customers unable to make or receive calls. Despite the company, owned by BT, stating the network is "running as normal" after overnight maintenance, many users continue to report significant service disruptions. Customers, including an elderly couple unable to make vital daily calls, have expressed frustration over the ongoing issues and what they describe as a lack of communication from the provider. This follows a major outage earlier in the week that also impacted emergency service calls.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing electricity demand from data centers powering artificial intelligence is a major factor behind rising summer utility bills in the U.S., according to PJM Interconnection, the nation's largest grid operator. These AI-focused data centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional ones, placing a significant strain on the existing power grid. With many fossil fuel plants shutting down and clean energy development facing delays, the grid is struggling to keep pace with demand. Consequently, customers in the 13 states served by PJM may see their monthly bills increase by $25 or more.</p>

          <p>Following a viral scandal, tech company Astronomer has hired actress Gwyneth Paltrow as a "very temporary" spokesperson to help manage public perception. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a stadium KissCam during a Coldplay concert, an event Paltrow is humorously connected to via her previous marriage to frontman Chris Martin. In a short video, Paltrow acknowledged the company's newfound attention and stated they are returning their focus to business. The incident ironically led to a 20% jump in online streams for Coldplay's music.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced that both Thailand and Cambodia are seeking an immediate ceasefire after three days of deadly border fighting. He stated on social media that he had spoken with the leaders of both nations, Cambodian leader Hun Manet and Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, suggesting that peace seems to be a natural outcome. Trump also linked future U.S. trade agreements with both Southeast Asian countries to the successful resolution of the conflict. The fighting, centered around a disputed 11th-century temple, has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is impacting large portions of the U.S. Southeast and Midwest, prompting widespread heat advisories and extreme heat warnings from the National Weather Service. Over 136 million people are under heat alerts, with regions from Florida to Virginia and across the Midwest experiencing dangerously high temperatures and heat indexes reaching up to 115°F. Forecasters attribute the extreme conditions to a heat dome, a persistent high-pressure system trapping hot air over the area. Officials are urging the public to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and limiting outdoor activities, to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the acclaimed film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film in 2027 make it an ideal time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 movie, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, was a cultural hit credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. The director hopes to reunite the original cast and potentially include cameo roles for current England players in the new installment.</p>

          <p>An internal analysis by USAID officials found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. The report, which examined over 150 incidents between October 2023 and May 2025, contradicts repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel used to justify restricting aid flow through established channels. While the analysis noted instances of aid loss where the perpetrator was unidentified, it did not support the assertion that Hamas was regularly interfering with aid distribution. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the report's findings.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing on 174-2 and reducing their deficit to 137 runs. After an early collapse to 0-2, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) blunted the English attack, which was missing the bowling of all-rounder Ben Stokes. Earlier, Stokes had scored his 14th Test century, a knock of 141, to help England post a massive total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined stand has kept their hopes of securing a draw alive.</p>

Sheriff Robert Luna stated that an extensive search of the area, including vehicles and buildings, has failed to locate the second grenade.

          <p>BBC's international editor, Jeremy Bowen, argues that allowing airdrops of aid into Gaza is a crude and inefficient solution that will not end the widespread hunger. Drawing on his experience covering past conflicts, Bowen describes airdrops as a last resort that delivers very little aid compared to truck convoys and often leads to tragic accidents, such as pallets killing people or landing in minefields. He contends that the measure is an "act of desperation" that may look good on television but fails to address the core problem, which requires a ceasefire and unrestricted, long-term land access for humanitarian operations.</p>

The recall elections were seen as a critical test for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to oust the China-friendly KMT members and regain a majority in the legislature. For a recall to pass, it required support from over a quarter of eligible voters in a district, a threshold that was not met.

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts agreeing that the right amount depends on the individual. While the FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, recent studies offer conflicting views on its health impacts, linking it to both healthy aging and increased dementia risk. Proponents of alternative medicine like Deepak Chopra drink two to three cups before noon, a level dietitians consider safe for most. However, tolerance varies, and individuals should monitor for signs like anxiety or poor sleep and adjust their intake accordingly.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for some of the 252 Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison claim their clients endured "state-sanctioned torture." Following a prisoner swap deal, the men have been repatriated to Venezuela and are sharing their experiences, which include beatings, humiliation by guards, and poor living conditions with dirty water and limited food. One man, José Manuel Ramos Bastidas, was sent to the prison despite never being convicted of a crime in the U.S. and having agreed to his own deportation. His lawyers argue the U.S. government knowingly sent him to be tortured.</p>

The accusations rely heavily on a witness allegedly close to GERB, whose testimony has been questioned.

He highlighted that while Netflix still produces many hits, its viewing time per subscriber has declined, and it faces significant competition from free content on platforms like YouTube. Rogers noted that YouTube's share of total TV viewership now exceeds Netflix's. He also described artificial intelligence as a "double-edged sword" that could help Netflix with ad targeting but also empower independent creators on YouTube, further blurring the line between amateur and professional content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international research team has discovered that so-called "junk" DNA, which constitutes nearly half of the human genome, plays a crucial role in gene regulation. The study, published in Science Advances, focused on a family of "jumping genes" called MER11, which are ancient retroviruses that integrated into our ancestors' DNA millions of years ago. Researchers found that these sequences can act like "genetic switches," influencing which genes are turned on or off without altering the underlying DNA code. This finding challenges the notion that these elements are non-functional and suggests they have evolved to perform important regulatory functions.</p>

However, in this instance, Trump is perceived by some as defending those powerful interests, creating a conflict with his populist image that he is struggling to shake.
