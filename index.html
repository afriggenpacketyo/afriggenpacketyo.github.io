          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to the White House's peace plan, seeking compromises while maintaining key demands. The plan includes no restrictions on the Ukrainian military, a US-backed European security contingent, and the use of frozen Russian assets for reparations. However, it avoids explicitly demanding full territorial recovery or NATO membership, potentially offering common ground. President Zelensky's attendance at Pope Francis' funeral is contingent on the security situation in Ukraine, amidst ongoing Russian attacks. (not investment advice)</p>

The move allows authorities to once again pursue reporters' records in probes targeting leakers, citing the need to protect sensitive government information. Bondi emphasized the importance of press independence but argued that it should not hinder efforts to stop illegal leaks.

          <p>CBS's newsmagazine "60 Minutes" is facing an unprecedented crisis as the show lost its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited interference from the corporate owner, Paramount Global, which is seeking regulatory clearance from the Trump administration to complete an $8-billion merger with Skydance Media. Clouding the deal, which requires approval by the Federal Communications Commission, is President Trump’s $20-billion lawsuit against CBS over the program’s October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Confidence, swagger and even a bit of arrogance are part of what made “60 Minutes” a TV news powerhouse since 1968.</p>
