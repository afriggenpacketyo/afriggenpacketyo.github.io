          <p>The Trump administration has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a U.S.-backed peace proposal for Gaza, warning of severe consequences if the terms are rejected. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Arab and Turkish mediators are reportedly urging Hamas to agree, but senior figures within the group have indicated they are likely to reject the proposal, citing concerns over relinquishing their primary bargaining chip so early in the process.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon, an Obama appointee, has recused himself from a case concerning the Trump administration's deployment of the Oregon National Guard. The decision came after defendants noted a potential conflict of interest arising from his wife, Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, who has been a vocal critic of the administration's actions in Portland. The legal challenge was brought by the state of Oregon and the city of Portland against the federal government's move to call the troops into federal service to address ongoing protests.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has led to significant disruption across Northern Ireland, prompting the early closure of hundreds of schools and the cancellation of events. The Met Office issued amber and yellow weather warnings for high winds and rain, with gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph in coastal areas. The severe weather has impacted travel, with bus and train services disrupted and some flights from Belfast City Airport canceled. Authorities have advised the public to take precautions due to the risk of falling trees and surface water on roads.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a Hawaii law that restricts individuals with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns onto private properties open to the public, such as malls or restaurants, without explicit permission from the owner. This case follows the court's 2022 decision that expanded Second Amendment rights, setting a new standard for gun regulations. The Trump administration urged the court to take up the case, arguing that the Hawaii restriction functions as a near-total ban on carrying firearms in public for self-defense, while gun control advocates support the law.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over 100 days, is set to be deported to El Salvador. Guevara, a longtime Atlanta-area reporter who fled El Salvador in 2004, was arrested on minor charges that were quickly dismissed while he was livestreaming a protest. Press freedom organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists have condemned his detention and pending deportation, arguing it represents a threat to media freedoms and creates a chilling effect on journalists covering law enforcement activities in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago transit system projects, citing a need to review potential "unconstitutional practices" related to race- or gender-based contracting. The Department of Transportation blamed the review's slowdown on the ongoing government shutdown, which it attributed to Democratic leaders. This action follows similar funding freezes for large infrastructure projects in New York and the cancellation of nearly $8 billion for climate-related initiatives in states won by the Democratic presidential nominee, escalating political tensions amid the shutdown.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. For a $30,000 HELOC, monthly payments are now estimated to be between $285 and $362, depending on the repayment term, which is lower than costs seen earlier in the year. Analysts anticipate that HELOC rates may decrease further, as the Federal Reserve is expected to implement additional rate cuts before the end of the year, making it a potentially cheaper borrowing option for those with significant home equity.

          <p>A 27-year-old father, Daniel Gunter, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 20 years for the murder of his two-week-old son. The baby, Brendon Staddon, was born prematurely and suffered catastrophic injuries, including a fractured skull and broken neck, while in a hospital's special care unit. During the trial, the court heard that Gunter had been observed being rough and impatient with the infant. The judge described the assault as a brutal and premeditated act and an extreme abandonment of his duty of care.</p>

          <h2>Digital Price Tags Becoming Common in US Grocery Stores, Sparking Pricing Debate</h2>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery chains like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods. This technology allows retailers to update prices across thousands of stores in minutes, improving efficiency and enabling quicker price adjustments for perishable or seasonal items. However, some lawmakers have raised concerns that these digital tags could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where costs for essential goods could fluctuate based on demand. Retailers maintain they do not engage in surge pricing and use the technology to manage inventory and offer targeted discounts.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team began their World Cup campaign with a commanding 10-wicket win after bowling South Africa out for a mere 69 runs. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was the standout bowler, taking three wickets for just seven runs and dismantling South Africa's top order. The Proteas' batting lineup collapsed, with only one player reaching double figures in their third-lowest one-day international total. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, then comfortably chased the target in just over 14 overs, securing a crucial victory and a significant net run-rate advantage.</p>

          <p>The collective wealth of the top 1% of Americans surged to a record $52 trillion in the second quarter, according to new data from the Federal Reserve. This increase was part of a broader $5 trillion gain for the top 10% of households, largely driven by a rally in the stock market. Since 2020, the top 10% have added over $40 trillion to their wealth, highlighting a growing concentration at the top. This trend has led to a bifurcated consumer economy, with spending increasingly powered by the affluent, creating potential risks if the stock market were to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the industrial city of Monterrey, Mexico, a unique subculture has revolved around Colombian cumbia music for decades, driven by DJs known as "sonideros." This movement gave birth to a slowed-down version of the genre called "cumbia rebajada" and a distinct urban style among youths known as "cholombianos." Though the scene was forced indoors during a period of intense cartel violence, cumbia has since returned to the streets. The article explores the cultural identity, resilience, and deep connection the city's migrant communities have with the classic rural sounds of Colombia.</p>

          <p>The execution of a man convicted of double murder in Taiwan has reignited the debate over the country's use of capital punishment. The execution was the first in five years and occurred despite a recent Constitutional Court ruling that narrowed the scope of the death penalty. Supporters argue it provides justice and is backed by public opinion, while opponents, including the European Union and human rights NGOs, contend it violates the right to life and undermines Taiwan's democratic progress. Critics also argue the execution was carried out unlawfully while an appeal was still pending.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has warned that a stock market "drawdown" is likely within the next one to two years, following a period of intense growth fueled by the AI frenzy. Speaking at an event in Italy, Solomon compared the current market excitement to the dot-com bubble, suggesting that while the technology is real, market enthusiasm has run ahead of potential, and a reset is inevitable. He cautioned that when the correction occurs, a significant amount of deployed capital will fail to deliver returns, causing negative sentiment among investors. (not investment advice)</p>
