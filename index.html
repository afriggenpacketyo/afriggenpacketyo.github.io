          <p>Representative Gerry Connolly, a leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has announced his impending resignation and will not seek reelection due to the recurrence of esophageal cancer. Connolly, who was first elected in 2009, had previously announced his diagnosis six months prior and underwent treatment. He stated that despite initial success, the cancer has returned, prompting his decision to step back from public service. Connolly expressed pride in his accomplishments over his 30-year career and gratitude for the support he has received.</p>

          <p>Shares of the British food delivery company Deliveroo experienced a significant surge following a $3.6 billion takeover bid from the U.S. giant DoorDash.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan interest rates will remain relatively steady in the near term, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to further rate cuts. While rates have decreased slightly compared to last year, the Fed's current stance suggests no immediate plans for additional reductions. Some experts foresee potential rate drops later in the year, contingent on market conditions and the Fed's future decisions. HELOCs may present a more attractive option for homeowners seeking to tap into their equity, as they currently offer lower rates than home equity loans, but come with variable interest rates.

          <p>Ryan Coogler's new Black horror film, "Sinners," is being critically analyzed for its rich symbolism and political subtext, examining the moral dichotomies within the Jim Crow South setting.

The guitar, representing Black music history, is a key symbol, as it attracts both Black artists and white vampires, and ultimately becomes a weapon against the main vampire.

          <p>Settling a debt typically does not improve your credit score in the short term and may initially cause it to decrease. While settling a debt can provide financial relief, credit scoring models generally view it less favorably than paying the full amount. Settled accounts are usually marked as "settled" or "paid-settled" on your credit report, signaling that you didn't repay the full balance. However, if the account was already seriously delinquent, settling the debt can be a step toward rebuilding credit over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Performance Under Trump Worst Since Nixon</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance for the start of a presidential term since the 1970s. The S&P 500's 7.9% drop is the second-worst first 100-day performance since President Richard Nixon's second term. Investor confidence has waned due to Trump's aggressive approach to trade, raising concerns about inflation and a potential recession. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory following Trump's tariff announcement.</p>
