        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes setting reciprocal tariffs at 15%. A key component of the agreement is the reduction of U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%, a move that provided relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry. The deal, which Trump claimed would involve a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S., was met with a strong positive reaction in Japanese markets, with major auto stocks soaring. The agreement is also seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have removed interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, from her position as the state's top prosecutor. Citing a rarely used power, the judges appointed her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role. However, hours later, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted Grace, with Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing the judges of being "rogue" and undermining presidential authority. The move was condemned by New Jersey's Democratic senators as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and intimidate public servants.</p>

          <h2>Former Trump Border Official Criticizes Hunter Biden's Immigration Remarks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 22:54:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Homan, who served as President Trump's border czar, strongly criticized Hunter Biden for his recent comments on immigration policy. In a podcast interview, Biden had used profanity to describe Trump as a "thug" and compared his deportation agenda to Nazi Germany. Homan responded on Fox News by dismissing Biden's opinion, referring to his past struggles with drug addiction, and praised the security of the border under the Trump administration. The exchange also drew a response from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who made a similar reference to Biden's past drug use.</p>

          <p>According to the latest Henley Passport Index, Singapore once again holds the title for the world's most powerful passport, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. Japan and South Korea tied for second place, while several European nations rounded out the top rankings. The index highlights a continued decline for the United States and the United Kingdom, which have slipped to 10th and 6th place, respectively, after once holding the top position. The ranking primarily measures the number of destinations a passport holder can visit without a prior visa, reflecting global mobility and diplomatic strength.</p>

          <p>Chinese firms are being encouraged to integrate more deeply with local economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods transshipped through countries like Vietnam to circumvent levies on Chinese products. An economist from the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local supply chains, Chinese businesses can better shield themselves from unpredictable trade policies. This strategy is seen as a long-term solution as Chinese exports currently face an average U.S. tariff rate of 42%. (not investment advice)</p>

Auto exports are a critical component of Japan's economy, accounting for over 28% of all shipments to the U.S. in 2024, making the tariff news particularly impactful for the sector.

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a history stretching back 250 years. Originally a Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, which dated the ship's timbers, and archival research conducted by archaeologists and local community members. The ship wrecked in 1788, but all 56 crew members survived, and its timbers are now being preserved by the local heritage center.</p>

          <p>Capital One's stock increased following its second-quarter earnings report, which was heavily influenced by its recent acquisition of Discover. Despite a reported net loss under standard accounting principles due to the deal, adjusted earnings per share significantly beat estimates, signaling underlying strength. The company's credit trends are improving when excluding the one-time provisions for Discover's loan portfolio. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the long-term strategic value of owning a payments network, and the company is on track to achieve $2.5 billion in synergies from the integration.

The company, which owns brands like Reese's and KitKat, stated the change is a direct reflection of rising ingredient prices and not related to trade policies. Global cocoa prices have skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, caused by adverse weather and disease. In response, Hershey also plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."</p>

The article points to the recent reassignment of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids, the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy, as the latest example in a pattern that includes the firings of several other high-ranking female officers. The author contends that these moves reflect Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's documented views against what he calls "social engineering" in the military, sending a chilling message that women are not welcome in top roles.</p>

Locals claim that the proliferation of these shops, many run by a few main operators, has pushed out essential businesses like grocers and butchers, making the area less livable for families. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, the influx of visitors and the conversion of residential properties to short-term lets have led to a decline in the local school's population and a sense that residents are being squeezed out.</p>
