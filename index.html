          <p>Databricks, a data analytics startup, has announced its acquisition of Neon, a cloud-based database software vendor, for around $1 billion, marking another significant deal for Databricks, following its purchases of MosaicML and Tabular. Neon, founded in 2021, boasts over 18,000 customers, including OpenAI and Adobe, and is known for its open-source platform that rivals Amazon Web Services' Aurora Postgres. Databricks' CEO, Ali Ghodsi, praised Neon's architecture, which separates computing work from data storage for cost-effectiveness. The acquisition's implications for Neon CEO Nikita Shamgunov's role are yet to be determined, but Databricks intends to integrate Neon's technology to enhance its data processing capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Justice Secretary has announced that over a thousand inmates will be released early to alleviate overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales, where offenders serving one to four years who are recalled to prison for breaching their licenses, will be released after 28 days. Shabana Mahmood stated that while a Â£4.7bn investment is planned for new prisons, it will not be enough to solve the crisis. A Ministry of Justice official warned that prison capacity would be exhausted within five months without intervention. The changes will not apply to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk, and the government faces running out of spaces for male offenders by November.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to provide Qatar Airways with up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X planes powered by GE engines. According to the White House, this is Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order, and was formalized during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates that the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during the production and delivery of the aircraft. The deal could provide a financial boost for Boeing, which has faced safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and trade disruptions, while also nearly doubling Qatar Airways' fleet.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to Harvard University, President Alan Garber has announced a voluntary 25% pay cut for the upcoming fiscal year.

Harvard filed a lawsuit in April after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding, citing concerns over race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus.

Newsom must decide whether to cut coverage for immigrants or find other budget solutions, amidst tepid public support for providing health care to undocumented immigrants. The governor's budget revision proposes an enrollment freeze and monthly premiums for immigrants without legal status, while Republicans propose cutting Medicaid funding for states that provide such coverage.</p>

The current proposal would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, though some lawmakers seek a higher limit. The full House vote is expected soon, but the bill could face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

In a statement regarding Operation Sindoor, India claimed its Air Force successfully bypassed and jammed Pakistan's Chinese-supplied air defense systems. This comes after India launched strikes on alleged "terror bases" in Pakistan in response to a tourist attack in Kashmir, leading to escalating military engagements and a subsequent ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <p>Republicans are once again targeting Medicaid, aiming to cut costs and impose stricter requirements for enrollees, but face greater opposition than in 2017 due to increased enrollment and wider program acceptance. A GOP proposal would require enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or studying, and increase their share of care costs. The bill also aims to curtail taxes levied on providers that help states draw down additional federal money. The changes could cause millions to lose coverage, and the focus is on offsetting tax cuts rather than fixing the health system.</p>

The de minimis exemption had allowed millions of packages to enter the U.S. duty-free, benefiting companies like Shein and Temu but angering American businesses.

School districts are sending letters to families, pleading for intervention, and some have suspended students and imposed fines for damages.

Additionally, Newsom is proposing a $100 per month premium for Medi-Cal enrollees 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," starting in 2027.

          <p>Mookie Betts' 2-year-old son, Kaj, delighted fans by running away with the baseball during his ceremonial first pitch on his dad's bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium. Wearing a replica of his father's jersey, Kaj sprinted towards right field before being scooped up by his mom and returning to deliver the pitch/roll to Betts. The adorable moment provided a bright spot for L.A. fans on a night when the Dodgers were defeated by the Athletics 11-1.</p>
