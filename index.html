        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology firm Oracle is part of a consortium that could enable TikTok's continued U.S. operations if a deal between the U.S. and China is finalized. The agreement's precise structure, including ByteDance's involvement and control over TikTok's algorithm, remains unclear, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss it soon. This development follows years of national security concerns over the app and a recent Supreme Court decision upholding a divestment law, which Trump has repeatedly delayed. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to route U.S. user data through its servers, indicating its long-standing potential as a suitor.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is under increased scrutiny regarding his leadership, particularly after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, where he prematurely announced an arrest on social media. Despite a lawsuit from former FBI officials alleging political firings and criticism from Democrats, Senate Republicans appear to maintain confidence in Patel's overall track record. The upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing will address these concerns, with Democrats signaling intent to challenge Patel's conduct and politicization of the agency. Patel defended his social media post as a push for transparency, acknowledging it could have been worded better.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's readiness to ban TikTok in the U.S. was the decisive factor in reaching a deal framework with China. Trump's clear message that national security would not be compromised for a deal shifted negotiations, despite commercial terms being largely agreed upon months prior. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. operations or risk a shutdown, though an extension may be granted. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are slated to discuss finalizing the agreement soon.</p>

          <p>Following heavy airstrikes, the Israeli military has commenced an expanded ground offensive in Gaza City to dismantle Hamas' infrastructure, urging residents to move south. This comes as the UN estimates over 220,000 Palestinians have already fled northern Gaza, with many unable to evacuate further due to overcrowding and high costs. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Qatar, warning that time is 'running out' for a peace deal, while independent UN experts issued a report accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel vehemently rejects. The situation remains highly volatile with significant humanitarian and diplomatic implications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice-President JD Vance has urged that individuals celebrating the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk be held accountable, even suggesting contacting their employers. This call comes as several people, including a Secret Service employee, have faced suspension or termination for inappropriate social media posts regarding Kirk's death. Vance, guest-hosting Kirk's show, asserted that left-wing Americans are more prone to defending political violence, despite police indicating the suspect acted alone. Critics argue such actions threaten free speech, though U.S. companies retain broad latitude in employee termination.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has ordered a fresh investigation into MI5's provision of false evidence to three courts regarding conversations with the BBC. This directive follows High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal rejections of MI5's prior explanations, which cited procedural deficiencies in their internal inquiries. The case involves a neo-Nazi state informant, Agent X, who used his MI5 role to sexually assault his girlfriend. MI5's Director General had previously apologized for lying about the informant's identity, which the BBC exposed with evidence. The new inquiry aims to determine next steps, including potential contempt of court proceedings.</p>

          <p>Maria Caulfield, a former Conservative health minister, has announced her defection to Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, becoming the 15th former Tory MP to join. Having lost her seat in the last general election, Caulfield stated the Conservative Party no longer aligns with her beliefs, seeing Reform as the future for right-minded conservatives. This defection follows a sitting Tory MP's move to Reform, highlighting a growing shift within British politics. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch dismissed Reform as focused on 'Westminster bubble issues,' while critics point to Caulfield's past controversial stances on issues like abortion.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has announced encouraging late-stage trial results for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilintide, as the pharmaceutical giant seeks a successor to its popular Wegovy drug. Early analysis showed the once-weekly injection led to an average weight reduction of 11.8% in patients after 68 weeks, significantly outperforming placebo. Cagrilintide, an amylin analogue, functions differently from existing GLP-1s by increasing satiety, and was described as well-tolerated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects. This development is crucial as Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints and increased competition for its current blockbuster treatments.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its journalists in U.S. District Court in Florida. The lawsuit alleges that several articles and a book published before the 2024 election were part of a "decades-long pattern" of intentional and malicious defamation. Trump claims the statements were published negligently, with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. In a Truth Social post, Trump accused the newspaper of acting as a "virtual 'mouthpiece' for the Radical Left Democrat Party."</p>

          <p>Scientists have unearthed what are believed to be the world's oldest known mummies in southeastern Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years. Researchers discovered human remains with cuts and burn marks, suggesting bodies were smoke-dried over fires by hunter-gatherer communities. This practice, found across China, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian nations, allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with ancestors, bridging time and memory. The findings push back the timeline for mummification practices, previously attributed to the Chinchorro people 7,000 years ago, and offer significant insight into prehistoric funerary rituals.</p>

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed to dismantle 'terrorist networks,' despite police stating the suspect acted alone. While some targeted groups, like the Open Society Foundations and SPLC, deny federal contact, others are preparing for increased security and threats. Critics argue this rhetoric, echoing 1950s 'red scare' tactics, aims to silence dissent and weaponize government power against political opponents.</p>

Remembered as one of history's greatest heavyweight contests, the fight was a brutal test of human endurance and the culmination of a deeply personal rivalry that began in friendship and curdled into enmity. Beyond the ring, the event was a complex spectacle staged in the Philippines under an autocratic regime, reflecting broader themes of postcolonialism, race, and the commercialization of sport.

Historian Fara Dabhoiwala argues that free speech is historically contingent, shaped by power dynamics, and inherently an action with real-world effects, not merely an absence of censorship. The piece discusses how different contexts—artistic, political—demand varying considerations for speech and harm. It critiques the 'marketplace of ideas' metaphor as unrealistic in today's media environment, advocating for more sophisticated approaches to regulating online platforms and their amplification power, drawing comparisons to European models.</p>

Partey, 32, was charged last month with five counts of rape against two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman, alleged to have occurred between 2021 and 2022 while he played for Arsenal. He denies the charges and was granted conditional bail before signing with Villarreal. Partey is scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court for a plea hearing the day after his team's match.</p>

          <h2>Winter Fuel Payments Plunged by 9.3 Million Before Government U-Turn</h2>

          <p>New figures reveal that the number of winter fuel payment recipients plummeted to 1.3 million last year following controversial government cuts that means-tested the benefit. Previously, around 11 million pensioners in England, Wales, and Scotland received the payment to help with energy bills. However, a U-turn by the Chancellor in June means the vast majority of pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will again be eligible for the payment this coming winter. The policy reversal aims to alleviate widespread anger and a political backlash over the initial cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have definitively identified the vibrant blue in Jackson Pollock's 'Number 1A, 1948' as manganese blue, a synthetic pigment. Using laser scattering to analyze paint scrapings, researchers confirmed this is the first documented use of this specific blue by Pollock. The analysis, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which was phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This discovery offers new insights into Pollock's materials and methods, aiding in art conservation and authentication efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, potentially adding over £500 annually for new pensioners, according to the latest wage data. This increase is determined by the 'triple lock' policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics reported total pay growth at 4.7% for the three months to July, making it the likely figure for the increase. Concerns remain about more pensioners being drawn into the income tax net due to frozen personal allowances.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has informed suppliers that production at its factories will remain suspended until at least September 24 following a severe cyber attack, with industry sources warning disruption could extend into November. The hack, which occurred over two weeks ago, paralyzed JLR's IT networks and production lines globally, leading to a criminal investigation. Concerns are mounting over the impact on JLR's extensive supply chain, with small and medium-sized businesses facing potential bankruptcy without financial support. The shutdown is estimated to cost the company at least £50 million weekly in lost production.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has cancelled over 100 season tickets and apologized to supporters for an "oversight" after seats sold to tour organizers a decade ago were recently detected being resold. The club took action following an investigation into unauthorized ticket reselling, prompted by a school nearly 200 miles away purchasing tickets for a Champions League match against Barcelona. While the club ended agreements with third-party sellers four years ago, this specific deal was overlooked due to a lack of formal contract. Newcastle stressed it received no funds above face value and has returned the seats for official ballot sale.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency over its rising infant mortality rate, which reached a decade-high of 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. This crisis unfolds as the state halted data collection for the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams), a crucial CDC program, due to staff purges within the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health under the Trump administration. The cessation of Prams data collection, vital for policy-making and funding, is feared to exacerbate maternal and infant health challenges, especially given racial disparities and the state's near-total abortion ban.</p>

This hesitation, criticized by progressives like Bernie Sanders, highlights a rift within the party. While Governor Kathy Hochul offered a qualified endorsement, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, and House Minority Leader Jeffries, have remained silent.
