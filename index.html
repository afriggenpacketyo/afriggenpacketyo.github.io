          <p>At least three people, including two children, died in severe flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico. The floods were exacerbated by torrential rains falling on burn scars from previous wildfires, causing the Rio Ruidoso to reach a record high of 20 feet. Emergency crews conducted over 50 swift-water rescues, saving people from homes and vehicles, while one house was seen being swept away by the current. The governor has declared an emergency to secure federal aid for the devastated area.</p>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to a £100 million settlement to fund affordable housing, thereby avoiding a formal legal ruling from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator was investigating whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and buyer incentives, which could have inflated costs. The housebuilders do not admit any wrongdoing, but the agreement mandates they cease sharing such data and aims to provide a faster resolution than a prolonged investigation.

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended "fundamental" reforms to the UK criminal justice system, including judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposal aims to alleviate a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in the Crown Court, which has caused years-long delays for victims and defendants. While supporters like the Met Police Commissioner argue the changes are necessary to prevent a "total system collapse," some legal professionals express concern, viewing the right to a jury trial as a cornerstone of fair justice.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a "pivotal moment" due to an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange, with 213 firms having left since 2016. The group is calling for urgent action, including lighter regulation and new investor incentives, to make UK markets more attractive. CBI chair Rupert Soames suggested that tax laws could be changed to encourage investment in stocks over cash savings to help stem the outflow and support the nation's financial services industry.

Instead of focusing on criminals, the widespread raids are detaining long-term residents and causing fear within Latino communities, including among citizens and Republican supporters. This approach is drawing comparisons to California's Proposition 187 in the 1990s, which radicalized a generation of Latino voters against the Republican party, potentially repeating a strategic political error.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has revealed that two people pleaded guilty to federal gun charges for their role in selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump. Court filings state that Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine sold Routh an SKS rifle for cash, knowing he was a convicted felon and thus prohibited from owning a firearm. Routh was allegedly found with a similar rifle outside Trump's golf club weeks later; he has pleaded not guilty to the assassination attempt charges.</p>

          <h2>Hydrologists Note Historical Precedent for Deadly Central Texas Flooding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to hydrologists, the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River was a known risk based on historical data from the region, known as "Flash Flood Alley." Experts at the West Gulf River Forecast Center state that the river has seen major, deadly floods more than a dozen times in the last century, with similar events occurring in 1987 and 2015. While the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch hours before the disaster, the key challenge remains pinpointing the exact location of the heaviest rainfall and ensuring warnings are received in time, especially overnight.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 win against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Despite an early home run from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' lineup was unable to handle the 23-year-old's overpowering fastball, which consistently topped 100 mph. The victory extended the Dodgers' losing streak to five games, with veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw praising his young counterpart's "unbelievable" and "special" performance on the mound.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has issued new tariff letters targeting Japan and South Korea, threatening duties of 25% on imports from the key U.S. allies. The move raises concerns for the two export-dependent economies, which are already grappling with slow growth and existing tariffs on steel and auto exports. While Trump indicated a willingness to negotiate if the countries open their markets, economists warn the additional tariffs could significantly hamper GDP growth and potentially push Japan's already fragile economy into a recession.

The concert celebrated his recent reacquisition of the full rights to his CCR songs, and he performed iconic hits like "Bad Moon Rising" and "Fortunate Son" with the same intensity that defined his legendary career.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. The move comes after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on any country that is part of the BRICS economic bloc, which he claimed was set up to harm the U.S. and its currency. Trump's increasingly aggressive posture towards the group, which unites several major emerging economies, has been met with this strategic effort to strengthen economic ties among its members.
