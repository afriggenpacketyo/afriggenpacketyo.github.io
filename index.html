          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, overcoming a four-shot deficit on the final day to win his 18th PGA Tour title. Overnight leader Robert MacIntyre of Scotland faltered early with consecutive bogeys, allowing Scheffler to take the lead by the seventh hole. Despite some late-game tension and a few uncharacteristic errors from both players, Scheffler's class showed through, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole. He finished with a three-under-par 67, ending the tournament at 15 under, two strokes clear of MacIntyre.</p>

          <p>Iraqi officials have initiated the excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing thousands of victims killed by the Islamic State group a decade ago. The site, known as al-Khafsa, may be one of the largest mass graves in modern Iraqi history, with many victims thought to be security personnel and members of minority groups. The complex operation involves gathering surface remains and collecting DNA samples from families for identification, but a full exhumation requires international support. The extremist group was notorious for its brutality, including massacres and sexual assault against civilians.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Redondo Beach, California, arrested two men from New York on suspicion of a home invasion robbery. The suspects, identified as Jesus Velez and Draven Luna, allegedly broke into a residence, zip-tied two occupants, and held them for an extended period. A 911 call reporting a person with a gun in a vehicle led police to the location on Matthews Avenue. The victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, with one requiring hospitalization. The suspects were apprehended nearby without incident and face charges of robbery, kidnapping, and burglary as the case is presented to the district attorney.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian designer who has previously worked with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicts he will adopt a more formal, military-style suit for his upcoming meeting with former President Donald Trump. This sartorial choice is anticipated following criticism Zelenskyy received for his informal attire during a tense Oval Office visit in February. Designer Elvira Gasanova suggests the Ukrainian leader will likely choose a serious look to avoid similar controversy, noting that he does not have personal stylists and that the pressures of war have physically affected him. The high-stakes meeting follows recent U.S.-Russia talks in Alaska aimed at negotiating an end to the war.</p>

However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding pigeons is a pious act, and from others who see the birds as part of the city's cultural fabric. With India's pigeon population increasing by over 150% since 2000, officials are now seeking a middle ground, potentially allowing controlled feeding based on expert recommendations.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new drugs and revenue generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts estimate that Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40% to 4.1 billion yuan, with revenue climbing 9%. The company's strategic shift towards innovative drugs is reducing its reliance on generics, which are expected to constitute a much smaller portion of its business in the coming years.

In contrast, his opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for maintaining the current, broader-appeal strategy that led to record success in the last general election.

Ukrainian officials feel this approach is strategically unsound and politically untenable, as it would involve surrendering land they have fought to defend.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a historically low birth rate, a demographic trend also seen in countries like Japan, raising concerns about future economic stability. The U.S. total fertility rate has fallen below the 2.1 children per woman needed for natural population replacement, largely due to fewer births among women under 30. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as increased contraception use, delayed marriage, and economic anxieties. This trend could lead to a "demographic cliff," with a smaller young population struggling to support a larger elderly one, impacting everything from university enrollment to Social Security.</p>

This slogan is associated with the World War Two-era, Nazi-allied Ustasha regime, and its use has been condemned by human rights groups as neo-fascist.

This decline, driven by a record-low birth rate and falling marriage rates, poses significant threats to the nation's economy, military, and social structure. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-run dating app and a four-day workweek for some employees to encourage family formation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on the opening day of the season, with a crucial error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir proving decisive. United's manager, Ruben Amorim, chose to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, a decision that came under scrutiny after the Turkish keeper failed to handle a corner, leading to Riccardo Calafiori's winning goal. Despite a more threatening attack following a £200m summer investment in forwards, United could not find an equalizer. The loss has reignited debate about the club's goalkeeping situation and whether a top-tier replacement is needed.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old American tourist sustained severe injuries after being attacked by a shark while spearfishing near Big Grand Cay in the Bahamas. The incident occurred Sunday afternoon, and the man was transported to a local clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further medical treatment. While shark attacks are rare globally, the Bahamas has one of the highest rates of incidents. This attack follows several others involving tourists in the region over the past year, including a fatal encounter in December 2023 and another incident involving a 10-year-old boy in January 2024.</p>

          <p>According to Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, Russia has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and Europe to provide Ukraine with "robust" security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal. Witkoff stated that this arrangement could include "Article 5-like language," referencing NATO's collective defense principle, which would be a significant concession from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the offer "historic" ahead of his meeting with Trump and European leaders. The development comes after the Alaska summit, where territorial disputes, particularly over the Donetsk region, remained a key point of contention in negotiations to end the war.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended its plans to resume operations after its flight attendants' union defied a government-issued order to end their strike. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members would not return to work, calling the order unconstitutional and demanding that the airline negotiate a fair contract. The strike, which began Saturday, has grounded approximately 700 daily flights and stranded over 100,000 passengers. The union is seeking pay for time flight attendants spend on the ground between flights, a demand that has so far been unmet in contract negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite official figures suggesting steady visitor numbers, many businesses in Florida's beach cities are reporting a significant downturn this summer, with some calling their towns "ghost towns." This slump is attributed to economic pressures on American consumers, who are cutting back on travel spending due to inflation and a gloomy economic outlook. While overall arrivals may be stable, reduced spending on items like lodging and airfare is impacting local economies. For travelers with flexible budgets, this downturn could present an opportunity for discounts on hotels, attractions, and other services in typically popular destinations. (not investment advice)</p>

With the season opener against the Houston Texans just three weeks away, the team has provided few updates on his condition or timeline for return. In his absence, backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking snaps, but Stafford's availability is crucial for the team's Super Bowl aspirations.

Their return follows a successful delay of the initial special session and a counter-move by California Democrats to redraw their own maps. While GOP officials have threatened arrests, the Democrats' return means the Texas legislature will likely have a quorum, allowing the controversial redistricting measure to proceed.</p>
