          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 13:30:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An explosion, believed to have originated in the boiler room, caused a corner of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx to collapse on Wednesday morning. The blast sent debris raining down onto the street, but remarkably, officials have reported no injuries or fatalities. Mayor Eric Adams and other city officials were on the scene, coordinating evacuations and inspections to ensure the building's structural integrity. The incident draws comparisons to a similar building collapse in the Bronx in late 2023, which also resulted in no serious injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction significantly alters the cost of homeownership, with the monthly principal and interest payment on a $450,000 mortgage now calculated at approximately $2,736. This represents a monthly saving of about $270 compared to rates in January 2025 and nearly $500 compared to October 2024. The lower rates are narrowing the gap between renting and buying for many potential homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand aimed at price-sensitive consumers, featuring over 1,000 items with most priced under five dollars. The brand, called Amazon Grocery, consolidates the company's existing Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh labels into a single offering. This move comes as consumers remain conscious of their spending and Amazon continues to adjust its grocery business strategy, which has included closing its U.K. Go and Fresh stores. The announcement caused a slight dip in the stock prices of competing grocery retailers like Walmart and Kroger.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate failed for a second time to advance legislation aimed at funding the government, ensuring the shutdown that began Wednesday morning will continue. Both a Democratic proposal, which included healthcare provisions, and a 'clean' Republican stop-gap bill failed to secure the necessary 60 votes to proceed. Congressional leaders from both parties continue to publicly blame each other for the impasse, with no immediate negotiations scheduled. The stalemate means the shutdown is likely to extend until at least Friday, leaving many federal workers without pay.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has charged former FBI Director James Comey with making false statements and obstruction of justice, stemming from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The indictment is seen by many as a politically motivated action desired by President Trump, who has frequently attacked Comey since firing him in 2017. The charges were notably signed by a U.S. attorney who was appointed just days after her predecessor resigned under pressure for not pursuing charges against another Trump target. This move is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting political opponents.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred President Trump's request to immediately fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position until oral arguments are heard in January. Trump has sought to remove Cook, citing unproven claims of mortgage fraud, in a move widely viewed as an attempt to exert political influence over the historically independent central bank. The case is considered a significant test of presidential authority over the Federal Reserve. Cook denies any wrongdoing and will continue to participate in the Fed's upcoming interest rate decisions while the case proceeds.</p>

In response, New Zealand captain Sophie Devine mounted a strong challenge with a century of her own, scoring 112 runs.

          <p>The indefinite suspension of the BET Hip Hop Awards has prompted a broader discussion about the commercialization of Black culture and the fragility of its historical archives. The decision, attributed to declining ratings, coincides with the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at BET's parent company, Paramount Global. This analysis argues that when culture becomes a commodity, it can be discontinued when it no longer serves corporate interests. The loss of the awards show highlights a need for more stable, community-controlled institutions to preserve cultural memory, especially as historical narratives face increasing political challenges.</p>

Kabila was accused of supporting the M23 rebel group, which controls large areas of the country's east. The ruling has sparked fears that it could destabilize the nation and derail fragile peace processes. Supporters of Kabila claim the trial was politically motivated by the current president, Felix Tshisekedi, to eliminate a political rival. However, some activists support the verdict, holding Kabila accountable for years of violence in the region.</p>

          <h2>Government Shutdown Begins After Congress Fails to Resolve Healthcare Funding Dispute</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government officially entered a shutdown after lawmakers could not agree on a temporary funding extension before the October 1 deadline. The central point of contention was Democrats' insistence on including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in any funding measure, a demand Republicans rejected. With spending authority now expired, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed, and essential workers will continue their jobs without pay. This marks the first government shutdown since the 35-day lapse in 2018-2019, with no clear path to a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>Following a Ryder Cup marked by hostile behavior from some U.S. fans at Bethpage, European golfer Tyrrell Hatton has called for European supporters to avoid seeking retribution when the event is held in Ireland in 2027. Several European players, notably Rory McIlroy, were subjected to abusive comments from the crowd. Hatton, who secured the victory for Europe, stated he prefers a respectful atmosphere where the focus is on the competition rather than attempts to distract players. His comments contrast with the U.S. captain's claim that the behavior was no different than that seen in Rome two years prior.</p>

However, gated facilities will be closed, and over 60% of NPS staff will be furloughed. Parks will be permitted to use funds from visitor fees to maintain essential services like restrooms and trash collection, a practice previously found to violate federal law.

          <p>The Reform UK party claims that leader Nigel Farage's publicly-funded security has been cut by 75% for 'inexplicable reasons' by parliamentary authorities. The party's head of policy stated that private donors are now funding additional security to compensate for the reduction. This claim comes amid a heated political dispute with the Labour Party, which Reform UK accuses of inciting violence against Farage with recent critical comments. A House of Commons spokesperson stated they do not comment on individual security arrangements but assured that a rigorous risk-based assessment process is in place for all members of Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has put a hold on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects: a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River and the expansion of New York City's Second Avenue subway. The White House budget director cited the administration's opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles as the reason. However, a transportation department official attributed the hold to the government shutdown, which has furloughed the staff needed to process the funds. The move is widely seen as a tactic to pressure Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, a key proponent of the projects.</p>

The data, which also included a downward revision for August, suggests a weakening labor market. The report takes on greater significance as the government shutdown is expected to delay the official Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report. Job losses were seen across several sectors, including leisure and hospitality, while education and health services saw gains. The report adds to concerns about the labor market despite recent strong GDP growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This is a modest decrease compared to rates seen earlier in the year and in late 2024. Home equity loans provide homeowners with a fixed-rate borrowing option for a variety of expenses.
