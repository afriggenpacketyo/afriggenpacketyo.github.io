          <p>Meghan Markle's new lifestyle brand, 'As Ever,' has launched with gourmet products that quickly sold out, raising concerns within the British royal family. Experts suggest the brand is capitalizing on Markle's fame and royal connections, a worry the royals reportedly had since she stepped back from royal duties. Some critics accuse Markle of using her children and royal ties to boost sales, while others defend her right to financial independence. Markle's success, dubbed 'The Meghan Effect,' mirrors the sales boost associated with Kate Middleton, but her brand's long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>This article addresses common misconceptions about raising bilingual children, emphasizing that learning multiple languages does not hinder development. Speech-language pathologists recommend strategies like 'one parent, one language' or designating specific times and places for minority language use.

The experts advise embracing imperfection and focusing on consistent exposure to foster a multilingual household.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that marketing's adoption of 'woke' values has ironically benefited the far right. By commodifying social progress and presenting it as a substitute for economic progress, brands have created a contradiction that right-wing movements have exploited. The author contends that consumers have grown cynical of corporations that promote social justice while contributing to economic inequality. This has led to a backlash, with some young people embracing authoritarian ideologies as a form of counter-culture, highlighting the need for genuine activism beyond superficial marketing campaigns.</p>

          <p>Despite Sierra Leone's declaration of a public health emergency over the synthetic drug 'kush,' women are disproportionately left without adequate support. Social factors, stigma, and limited access to treatment hinder their ability to seek help for addiction. Many women, like Zainab, turn to sex work to fund their drug use, facing further vulnerability and exploitation. While the government has implemented measures, critics argue that programs are underfunded and fail to address the specific needs of women affected by the kush crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has postponed a potential ban on TikTok for a second time due to stalled negotiations with China over a deal to sell its U.S. operations. This delay is linked to China's resistance to the administration's 'Liberation Day' tariffs. The administration has increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Trump has indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs to secure a TikTok deal, but Chinese government approval remains a hurdle. The original ban stemmed from bipartisan concerns about potential Chinese government access to American user data.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners marks a significant departure from the era of globalization. The move has sparked alarm among businesses, economists, and governments worldwide, with some drawing comparisons to Brexit.

However, critics warn of potential negative consequences, including increased costs for consumers and disruptions to global trade. The tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, are expected to impact various sectors and could lead to a trade war.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries has taken effect, marking a significant shift in global trade policy.

          <p>Across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports went into effect, marking the beginning of President Trump's 'Liberation Day' trade policy. More severe tariffs on specific countries, including China and the European Union, are scheduled to follow. Wall Street has reacted negatively to the news, with the trading session marking the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. Trump has dismissed concerns about the economic impact on American consumers, maintaining his stance on addressing trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, could lead to price increases for the iconic Air Jordan 1. While Nike's shares fell after the tariff announcement, the extent to which the company will pass on the cost increase to consumers remains uncertain. Analysts suggest that Nike may have to raise prices by 10-15%, but significant increases could reduce demand. Nike could also explore alternative strategies, such as downgrading the technology in the shoes or extending design cycles, to maintain affordable retail prices.</p>
