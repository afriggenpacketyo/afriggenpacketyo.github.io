        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is overhauling its asylum appeals system, establishing a new independent body to expedite cases and reduce reliance on taxpayer-funded hotels for migrants. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper aims to end "unacceptable delays," which currently see 51,000 cases awaiting decision for over a year, during which failed asylum seekers are accommodated at public expense. This initiative responds to increasing public pressure and recent protests, including a High Court ruling blocking a specific hotel from housing asylum seekers. The government is committed to closing all asylum hotels in a properly managed way.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has criticized President Donald Trump's reported plan to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, asserting there is no emergency and accusing Trump of "manufacturing a crisis." Pritzker stated the state has not requested federal assistance and views the move as a political maneuver to distract from other issues. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also voiced opposition, warning such a deployment could inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement, citing declining crime rates. The Pentagon reportedly planned this deployment for weeks, potentially involving thousands of troops.</p>

          <p>Estonians are actively preparing for a potential Russian invasion, with citizens like Ave Ungro joining volunteer defense organizations and undergoing military training. The country, a NATO and EU member, is significantly increasing its defense spending to 5.4% of GDP by 2029, a record among NATO states. Experts emphasize Estonia's deep-rooted self-defense culture and strong regional alliances, including new NATO member Finland, as crucial deterrents. While direct invasion is doubted, real Russian sabotage acts like GPS jamming and cable damage are pressing concerns, especially given the militarization of Kaliningrad.</p>

          <p>As fears of war in Europe intensify, tens of thousands of French citizens are joining military reserves, with numbers soaring from 28,000 in 2014 to over 46,000 today. President Macron aims to more than double this to 105,000 by 2035, significantly boosting military investment. This trend, mirrored across Europe, is driven by concerns over an aggressive Russia and doubts about US commitment under President Trump. Recruits undergo rigorous training, driven by patriotism and a desire to protect their country, reflecting a societal shift towards greater defense engagement.</p>

          <p>China's top envoy in Washington, Xie Feng, has vehemently rejected claims that Chinese ownership of US farmland poses a national security threat, labeling such suggestions "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie highlighted that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total US farmland, questioning how such a small percentage could jeopardize food security. He criticized restrictions on Chinese citizens and businesses buying farmland as purely political manipulation, aimed at derailing China-US agricultural cooperation for specific agendas.

          <p>Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has unveiled the Vivo Vision, a new mixed-reality headset designed to compete with Apple's Vision Pro. The Vivo device, which shares a similar design and intuitive eye-tracking/hand-gesture interface, is notably lighter at 398 grams and is expected to be significantly cheaper. It features dual OLED displays delivering 8K resolution, powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform for enhanced visuals. Currently, the headset is compatible only with certain Vivo phones and Windows computers for screen projections.</p>

          <h2>US Immigrant Population Declines by Over a Million Under Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that the US immigrant population has declined by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, marking a reversal of over 50 years of growth. The number of immigrants dropped from a record 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, with the immigrant share of US residents falling to 15.4%. Additionally, 750,000 immigrant workers have exited the US labor force. This decline is attributed to the Trump administration's wider crackdown on immigration policies.</p>

          <h2>Disability Charity Calls for End to Airport Drop-Off Fees for Blue Badge Holders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A disability charity is advocating for all UK airports to waive drop-off fees for blue badge holders, citing inconsistent and complex systems that often disadvantage disabled passengers. While some major airports like Gatwick and Heathrow already offer exemptions, others charge fees or provide free options further from terminals, which can be impractical. Disabled Motoring UK argues that blue badge holders deserve dignified treatment and should not be "fleeced." The issue highlights accessibility challenges and the need for standardized, user-friendly policies across the industry.</p>

          <p>Shane Gorman, whose father died in the 1988 Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, shares his personal journey of grief and his decision to follow his father into the offshore safety industry. The tragedy, which killed 167 men, was the world's worst offshore oil and gas accident, attributed to a "catalogue of things" including systemic communication failures and a flippant attitude towards safety. Gorman's work as a safety consultant is driven by a desire to understand and prevent future tragedies, emphasizing that people and safety must always take precedence over greed.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown oil paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, potentially worth over £100 million, are on display in Bucharest, but their authenticity is heavily disputed. The owner claims they were found under his wife's grandmother's mattress, inherited from her father in Soviet Ukraine. However, a top scholar, Konstantin Akinsha, notes the lack of documentation during Malevich's lifetime and inconsistencies in the provenance story. Despite certificates from a Kyiv art historian, technical analyses only date pigments, not confirm authorship, leaving the art world skeptical about these significant claims.</p>

          <p>Over 50 million Americans in the Western US are under dangerous heat alerts, with temperatures soaring into triple digits from Arizona to Washington, challenging daily records. This prolonged extreme heat, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, poses risks due to warm overnight temperatures preventing adequate cooling. Concurrently, the same weather pattern fuels monsoon thunderstorms, bringing flash flooding risks and lightning that could spark new wildfires in hot, dry areas. The Atlantic hurricane season remains active, with Tropical Storm Fernand forming and expected to strengthen over open waters.</p>

          <p>A father is advocating for pea protein to be added to mandatory food allergen labels after his nine-year-old son, Rex, suffered two severe anaphylactic shocks from unexpected pea ingredients in common foods. Pea is not among the 14 allergens legally required to be listed, leading to "booby-trapped" products for those with severe allergies. Other individuals with allergies to pulses or pine nuts also share experiences of severe reactions and feeling their allergies are not taken seriously. Experts support expanding the allergen list, a change advocates believe would significantly enhance safety and confidence for many when eating out.</p>
