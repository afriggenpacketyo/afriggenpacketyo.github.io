          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gidon Sa’ar criticized the United Nations as a "rotten, anti-Israel, and antisemitic body" during a hearing on Israel's legal responsibilities in Gaza. Sa’ar accused the UN of covering up terror affiliates within the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), alleging their involvement in the October 7, 2023, attacks. He presented evidence suggesting that 25% of UNRWA staff were implicated in terrorist activity prior to that date and also stated that Israel would not participate in what he called a "circus" intended to deprive Israel of its right to defend itself. The United States suspended aid to UNRWA after learning that some of its members participated in the Oct. 7 attack.</p>

          <p>Measles cases in Texas have increased to 663, with Gaines County being the epicenter, as the U.S. grapples with a significant resurgence of the disease. An eight-year-old child in Texas died from measles on April 3rd, according to health officials, who also noted that 87 patients have been hospitalized in the state. Experts warn that the U.S. is nearing a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter-century after its eradication, and vaccination rates have declined since the pandemic due to religious or personal conscience waivers. The article notes that multiple other states are seeing active measles outbreaks, and the CDC reports nearly 900 cases nationwide, tripling the cases from all of 2024.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, currently under investigation for allegedly mishandling sensitive military information, accompanied President Donald Trump to Michigan, signaling public support. During a speech at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Trump praised Hegseth, who in turn lauded Trump for restoring the warrior ethos and rebuilding the military. Hegseth's tenure has been marked by controversy, including allegations of financial mismanagement and sexual assault, which he denies, and scrutiny over his use of the Signal messaging app to share military plans with unauthorized individuals. The article notes that Hegseth recently ended a Defense Department program aimed at bolstering the participation of women in helping to resolve overseas conflicts, calling the effort a “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative.”</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and his Liberal Party secured 169 of 343 seats in Parliament, narrowly failing to win a majority and requiring support from other parties to pass legislation.

Carney, who campaigned as the anti-Trump candidate, will now face the challenge of defending Canada from economic damage caused by the trade war. In his acceptance speech, Carney warned Canadians of difficult times ahead and vowed to protect Canada's interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some automotive tariffs, aiming to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, the new measures provide partial reimbursements on parts-related levies for vehicles undergoing final assembly in the U.S. for two years. These reimbursements include potential offsets of an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car assembled before May 1, 2026. General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for solid profit growth this year as a result of the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s trade policies.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock plummeted 13% after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties affecting advertising demand. Snap CEO Derek Andersen cited potential constraints on advertising demand as the reason for holding off on guidance, with some advertisers reporting an impact from changes to the de minimis exemption. The company expects the number of daily active users to come in near the midpoint of its second-quarter range at 468 million, and lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range.

          <p>A federal judge criticized the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students as "arbitrary and capricious," demanding detailed explanations. The case involves Akshar Patel, an Indian student whose SEVIS record was terminated based on a speeding ticket. The judge questioned the administration's process, noting the lack of individualized determination before terminating students' records. While Patel's status remains active, the judge criticized the administration's actions as showing an "utter lack of concern for human individuals" and creating unnecessary legal costs for affected students.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states filed a lawsuit over dramatic cuts to Americorps, alleging the Trump administration is trying to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization. The lawsuit argues the cuts violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded Americorps. The White House said that Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. California's AmeriCorps volunteers amassed a total of 4,397,674 of service hours during the 2023-24 year.</p>

          <p>The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong has made two rare transits north of the Philippines within a week, in what analysts called a “show of force” as US and Philippine forces held joint drills in the area. The Shandong's passage through the Luzon Strait underscored Beijing's resolve to break through the first island chain in the face of US containment efforts. The Shandong, accompanied by six destroyers and frigates, as well as two support vessels, was first detected by the Philippine Navy last Tuesday. Aircraft on board the carrier conducted roughly 130 take-off and landing drills between Wednesday and Friday.</p>

          <p>Tony Blair called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is "doomed to fail". In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters "feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal". The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors. Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan. The proposal would save more than $330 billion and address the root causes of skyrocketing college costs, according to Committee Chairman Tim Walberg. The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans. The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process.</p>

Among his biggest moves so far: unilaterally rolling out an unpredictable, market-churning tariff regime that threatens to upend decades of U.S. trade relationships and alliances with its longtime partners. He has also worked to carry out an increasingly controversial mass deportation policy and, with the help of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a plan to drastically downsize the federal government by slashing whole departments and firing thousands of workers.
