        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK are anticipating a particularly sweet season in 2025, thanks to warm days and cool nights, which contribute to higher natural sugar levels in the fruit. Despite a dry spring, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate potential drought effects. The warmer weather has also accelerated the ripening process, leading to an earlier harvest. This positive outlook contrasts with the delayed ripening experienced in 2024 due to a wet winter. Consumers can look forward to enjoying exceptionally sweet strawberries this summer.</p>

          <p>Hawaiian lei making, an ancient tradition with deep cultural significance, is facing challenges due to climate change and suburban sprawl. The availability of locally sourced flowers is dwindling, with an estimated 90 percent now imported from countries like Thailand. As flower farms disappear and land overheats, lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like wood beads and unripe fruit. Despite these challenges, the tradition continues to be celebrated at the Annual Lei Day Celebration and remains an important expression of aloha.</p>

          <p>Democratic governors in states offering health insurance coverage for immigrants without legal status are proposing to roll back coverage, citing budget constraints. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom wants to freeze new enrollments for unauthorized adults on Medi-Cal and charge a monthly premium. Minnesota is considering stripping health insurance coverage for adults without authorization, although children would remain eligible. These proposals have faced opposition from Democrats and immigrant advocates, who argue that they will harm vulnerable communities. The changes come as Congress considers reducing state Medicaid funds for states offering such coverage.</p>

Chevron's outlook indicated a slowdown in the pace of its stock buybacks in Q2 2025 compared to the prior quarter amid tariff woes and the decision of OPEC+ to boost supply.
