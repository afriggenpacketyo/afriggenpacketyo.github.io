          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has resulted in hundreds of federal employee layoffs, with the CDC mistakenly issuing reduction-in-force notices to key staff due to a "coding error." These affected employees, including those involved in outbreak response and the MMWR journal, are expected to have their notices rescinded. President Trump has also directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use "all available funds" to ensure military members receive their pay on October 15, bypassing congressional deadlock. The administration's actions are drawing criticism from union leaders.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will guide the nation's development for the next half-decade. This plan is expected to inform high-level policy priorities and shape the evolution of infrastructure spending and investment. While past projects, like the 2009 stimulus, spurred growth, some also contributed to local government debt. Economists anticipate future infrastructure investments will be more technology-driven and people-focused, aiming for sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado has declared her country to be in "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro's regime. Speaking from hiding, Machado asserted that the Venezuelan people already mandated a regime change in the disputed 2024 election, which she claims was rigged. She also accused Maduro of operating as a drug cartel head, destabilizing the region and undermining U.S. institutions by harboring hostile foreign entities. Machado expressed support for President Trump's efforts to address the threat posed by Maduro.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire after sustaining injuries during an incident last year. The horse was one of five that broke free and galloped through London streets after being spooked by construction noise, resulting in a broken bone and serious bleeding. Four people and five soldiers were also injured in the chaos. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker was unable to return to duty, making retirement the best option for his welfare.</p>
