          <p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. fell in May, driven by concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The consumer sentiment index dropped to its second-lowest reading on record, while year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%. Tariffs were cited by nearly three-quarters of consumers as a key factor. A pause on tariffs between the U.S. and China was announced after the majority of the survey was completed, and the final sentiment index will be closely watched for any improvement.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is opposing a provision in a House Republican tax bill that would impose a 5% excise tax on remittances sent by non-U.S. citizens to their home countries. Mexican officials argue the tax would harm the economy of both nations and disproportionately affect low-income migrants. The proposal is estimated to generate $1 billion in tax revenue in 2026, but critics warn it could drive migrants to use informal channels, increasing risks of financial insecurity and money laundering. Representatives from the electronic payment transfer industry have also voiced concerns about the measure.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in three years in May, fueled by concerns that President Trump's trade policies will worsen inflation. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index declined nearly 30% since January. While some economists suggest the survey paints an overly negative picture, the decline in confidence may cause Americans to reduce spending. The article notes that the U.S. and China agreed to ease tariffs, but high duties remain in place, contributing to Americans' sour view of the economy's direction.</p>

          <p>A 1993 Minneapolis murder case was solved decades later using DNA and genetic genealogy, with bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene serving as a key piece of evidence. The victim, Jeanie Childs, was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Investigators initially suspected a man named Arthur Gray, but he had a solid alibi. In 2019, DNA evidence linked Jerry Westrom to the scene, and his footprints were later matched to those found at the apartment, leading to his arrest and conviction.</p>
