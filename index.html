          <p>A Japanese social media user known for exposing secrets of famous people, Yuki Azuma, was arrested for allegedly extorting a man out of 3 million yen in exchange for removing his personal information from the internet. Azuma, who posts as Entertainer Orihara, is accused of uploading the man's personal information and headshot to X and extorting the money from him at a Tokyo restaurant in October of last year. He hinted at further posts, telling the man he was considering releasing "everything," but has remained silent about the allegations. This arrest highlights the legal consequences of online harassment and extortion in Japan. The legal system is now involved in a case which involved a public figure who was known for exposing others. </p>

Despite the renewed diplomatic effort, the positions of both sides remain significantly far apart, which indicates that reaching a resolution may be a complex and challenging process. The international community is closely monitoring these discussions in the hope of de-escalating the conflict and finding a path towards lasting peace, however, the deep-seated disagreements continue to pose a significant hurdle. </p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, daughter of the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazism. Despite facing danger as a brown-skinned, queer woman during Hitler's rise, she remained in Germany and provided financial support, letters of recommendation, and immigration guarantees to those seeking refuge in Britain. Her efforts, largely undocumented during her lifetime, have been recognized posthumously, with her actions saving numerous families from persecution. A Kensington Palace exhibition titled "Princesses of Resistance" will showcase Catherine and her sisters' contributions in March 2026. </p>

          <p>In Boulder, Colorado, eight people were hospitalized after a suspect carried out what authorities are calling an "act of terrorism" on a pedestrian mall. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw an incendiary device at a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators while yelling "Free Palestine." The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained burns, with one in critical condition, leading to a cancellation of upcoming Run for Their Lives events. The FBI is investigating the incident as ideologically motivated violence, which is part of a wave of violence targeting the Jewish community. </p>

          <p>The US defense sector relies heavily on China for critical minerals essential to its advanced weapon systems, but Beijing's tightening export restrictions pose a growing risk to the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, leveraging this dominance as a negotiating point in trade wars and targeting defense industries in the US and its allies. Recent export bans and trade restrictions imposed by China on gallium, germanium, antimony, and rare earth elements are affecting American military end users. This dependence highlights the vulnerability of the US defense sector and the strategic importance of diversifying critical mineral sources. </p>

          <p>China has criticized U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for his remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore, accusing him of espousing a "Cold War mentality" and making defamatory allegations against China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that Hegseth's speech was filled with provocations intended to sow discord and falsely portrayed China as a threat, while the ministry insisted that the U.S. should not interfere in the Taiwan issue. Hegseth had said the U.S. would bolster its defenses overseas to counter threats by China, particularly toward Taiwan, and insisted that allies in the Indo-Pacific also contribute more to their own defense. The Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson also called Hegseth's comments a provocation that distorted China’s policy positions. </p>

          <p>A new book, *The Family Dynamic* by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and achievements, influence a person's life trajectory. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, potentially due to increased parental attention early in life, while siblings often spur each other to pursue different fields. Age gaps between siblings can also impact their relationships, as younger siblings may model their interests on a mix of their older siblings' influences. Siblings serve as vivid mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits, and challenging each other's flaws, which ultimately fosters a deeper understanding and acceptance. </p>

          <p>Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is nominated to become the next president of the United Nations General Assembly for a one-year term starting in September. Baerbock's nomination, while unopposed, caused some internal friction, as Germany had initially intended to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the position. During her tenure as Foreign Minister, Baerbock advocated for a "value-based foreign policy," often taking assertive stances on human rights and democratic freedoms, which sometimes led to diplomatic challenges. Despite these challenges, she remained a strong supporter of military aid to Ukraine and attempted to enact a more "feminist" foreign policy. </p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's promise to broker peace in Ukraine within a day, more than four months into his second term, the goal remains elusive. Russia has proposed another round of peace negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul, but both sides are entrenched in their positions on territorial disputes and sovereignty. Trump has expressed frustration and suggested he might "just back away" if progress isn't made, a move that experts warn could shift the balance of power to Russia. The U.S. role in negotiations has been described as "relatively weak," and analysts debate whether reducing engagement or cutting off aid would be more detrimental. </p>

          <p>Eight people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, after a man allegedly threw an incendiary device into a crowd and yelled "Free Palestine" during a rally for Israeli hostages. The FBI is treating the incident as an "act of terrorism," with the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly using a makeshift flamethrower. The victims, aged 67 to 88, sustained injuries ranging from minor to very serious, prompting condemnation from officials and community leaders. The attack has heightened tensions in the United States amid ongoing conflict and rising antisemitism. </p>

          <p>Secret Syrian intelligence files uncovered by the BBC confirm that missing American journalist Austin Tice was imprisoned by the regime of Bashar al-Assad after his disappearance near Damascus in August 2012. The files, verified by the BBC and law enforcement, show communications from different branches of Syrian intelligence, indicating that Tice was held in a detention facility in Damascus. Sources confirmed that Tice was arrested near Darayya and held by the National Defence Forces, where he was treated for stomach issues until at least February 2013. The regime had consistently denied knowing of Tice's whereabouts, but the BBC investigation proves this was false. </p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's presidential election with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski in a close race. The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. While most day-to-day power rests with the prime minister, the president's role is not merely ceremonial as the office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation. Nawrocki's victory could hinder Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to reverse laws that politicized the court system and fulfill promises to voters and the EU. </p>

The study revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry linked to Russia's far east.

Police said eight people - aged 52 to 88 - were injured in the attack at the Pearl Street Mall, a popular outdoor space in Boulder, about 30 miles (48km) from Denver. The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices. Footage of the attack shows the suspect, who was shirtless, screaming at the group and had what appears to be Molotov cocktails in each hand when he was arrested. </p>
