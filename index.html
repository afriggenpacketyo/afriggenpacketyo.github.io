The airline, which recently entered its second bankruptcy in under a year, plans a 25% capacity cut to reduce costs and focus on its most profitable markets. These measures are part of a broader strategy to shrink the company and achieve more stable financial footing amid high costs and shifting travel demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following public and political outrage over the host's monologue about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after the FCC chairman suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and Nexstar, a major affiliate group, announced it would preempt the show. Kimmel had suggested the alleged shooter was aligned with the MAGA movement, sparking intense controversy and accusations of politicizing a tragedy.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative, AI Fluency, that requires all incoming students to receive training in artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. The program aims to ensure graduates are proficient in both their chosen field and the application of AI technologies. This move responds to a dramatic increase in job market demand for AI skills, with some analyses showing a 619% rise in such listings over the past decade. The university hopes this requirement will give its students a competitive edge in the workforce.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% cut to its benchmark interest rate, a move that is unlikely to appease President Trump, who has been advocating for more aggressive cuts. The decision is seen by analysts as a measured response to recent weak jobs reports rather than a capitulation to political pressure from the White House. The article discusses this action in the context of Trump's ongoing criticism of the central bank and his administration's attempts to challenge its traditional independence.

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to cut its interest rate, the Bank of England is widely expected to hold its own rate steady at 4%. While the Fed's move was a response to a softening labor market, UK policymakers are contending with an inflation rate that remains nearly double their 2% target. This persistent inflation makes it unlikely that the Bank will risk stimulating the economy with a rate cut at its upcoming meeting, despite a desire from the government to boost economic growth.
