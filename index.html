            <p>California avocado growers are raising concerns about crop pests entering from Mexico due to the Biden administration's decision to end a USDA inspection program in Mexico, a program that ensured avocados exported to the U.S. were pest-free. This change followed threats from Mexican cartels, leading to Mexico being responsible for inspections. California growers fear corruption without U.S. oversight, as the avocado industry is a multibillion-dollar business often influenced by cartel activity. The USDA maintains its commitment to mitigating plant health risks without compromising employee safety, but California growers feel that the risk of corruption is too high.

            <p>Democratic lawmakers are warning that President Trump's trade agenda, characterized by heavy tariffs, risks corruption and self-dealing among administration officials and loyalists. In a letter to key cabinet members, they seek details on plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. The Democrats' move highlights their focus on Trump's economic policies as a point of resistance during his second term.

            <p>A sloth named Rico at Chester Zoo underwent pioneering dental surgery to cure a toothache, marking what is believed to be the first such operation on a sloth. A team from the zoo and Newcastle University worked together to remove infected tissue surrounding two teeth, going through the bottom of the tooth instead of a traditional root canal. The surgery was deemed successful, and Rico has been regularly monitored since, showing no return of the abscesses, though only one of the teeth could be saved. This operation provided unique insights into sloth dental anatomy.</p>

            <p>Prolonged school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic caused catastrophic consequences for millions of children and their families, extending beyond loss of learning to include stress, depression, and isolation. While initial closures were understandable, the lack of a plan to address potential harms and a strategy for unwinding interventions exacerbated the problem. Academic literature had warned about the damaging effects of school interruptions, including inequitable burdens on certain segments of society. The decision-makers failed to adequately acknowledge or plan for these consequences, resulting in a reactive approach that left millions of children behind.</p>

            <p>Turkey's central bank unexpectedly raised its key interest rate by 350 basis points, from 42.5% to 46%, halting the easing cycle that began in December.

The central bank aims to strengthen the disinflation process through moderation in domestic demand and improvement in inflation expectations.

            <p>China plans to host an informal United Nations session to denounce US tariffs, labeling them as a form of "bullying." The meeting aims to garner international support for multilateralism and counter US protectionism. Beijing argues that the US is violating international trade rules and causing economic instability. Despite a temporary pause on tariffs for most countries, China faces continued levies, leading to escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in North Dakota has ruled that over 9,000 Catholic employers do not have to comply with federal regulations protecting workers who seek abortions and fertility treatments. The ruling upholds the religious freedom rights of the Catholic Benefits Association and the Bismarck Diocese, finding that the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act violated federal law. The judge cited concerns about administrative actions against the free exercise of religion. The EEOC's guidelines were seen as conflicting with Catholic values, particularly regarding abortion, fertility treatments, and gender identity.</p>

            <p>Organ meats are experiencing a revival, driven by online wellness communities promoting "ancestral" diets and touting their nutrient density. Once viewed as second-rate food, offal is now being consumed in various forms, from raw to powdered, and added to smoothies and other dishes. This trend has led to increased sales of organ-meat products in grocery stores and the emergence of supplement companies specializing in offal. However, nutrition experts caution against overconsumption due to potential health risks, advocating for treating organ meats as food rather than supplements.</p>

The decision taught him that when an opportunity comes, you don't necessarily have to open your door, but you owe it to yourself to at least look through the keyhole. (not investment advice)</p>

The four-week average of applications also decreased, while the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits rose slightly.

            <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK will face legal action if it fails to update its gender policies to align with a recent Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" by biological sex. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is set to issue new guidance for public bodies, including the NHS, expecting changes to current practices. The current NHS guidance, which accommodates trans people based on their dress, names, and pronouns, would need to be revised. The ruling could impact single-sex spaces such as hospital wards and changing rooms.</p>
