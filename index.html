          <p>The Walt Disney Company is implementing layoffs impacting hundreds of employees across various divisions as part of a cost-cutting initiative amidst rapid industry transformation.

          <p>An inquest concluded that a benefits cut contributed to the suicide of Jodey Whiting, a housebound disabled woman from Stockton-on-Tees. Whiting's mental health deteriorated after her benefits were incorrectly stopped due to missing an assessment while hospitalized. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide, citing a deteriorating mental state precipitated by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) decision. The DWP expressed deep regret after the inquest revealed that Whiting had lost hope due to her financial struggles.</p>

Experts suggest this trend could lead to significantly less diverse campuses over time, while some schools are exploring alternative strategies to maintain diversity.
