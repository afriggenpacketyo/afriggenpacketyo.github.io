          <p>Following a 5-0 defeat to the Florida Panthers in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference final, Carolina Hurricanes captain Jordan Staal bluntly described the game as an 'a-- whooping.'

          <p>Dave Nadig, a financial futurist, predicts the ETF market will surge with potentially 3,000 new launches due to SEC rule changes allowing mutual funds to offer ETF share classes. He estimates the number of ETFs could jump from 4,000 to over 7,000, placing an 'enormous burden' on investors to navigate the options. While ETFs offer benefits like liquidity and low fees, Nadig advises caution with new, complex strategies like private credit ETFs, citing limited demand and SEC concerns. He also notes that investors should consider whether the ETF structure is suitable for illiquid assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while potentially harming low-income households. The bill's tax cuts, including those for business owners and investors, are estimated to cost trillions and are partially offset by reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and Yale Budget Lab indicate that the bottom 10-20% of households could see income declines, while the top 10% would experience income gains. The bill preserves a lower top tax rate and maintains tax breaks for investors, further skewing benefits toward high earners.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expediting the deployment of new nuclear reactors. The orders call for a 'total and complete reform' of the NRC, mandating decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months and potentially leading to staff reductions. The administration aims to create a regulatory framework for building nuclear reactors on federal land, bypassing direct NRC oversight for national security purposes. These actions also seek to boost uranium mining and domestic enrichment capacity, alongside accelerating reactor testing at national laboratories.</p>

These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.

          <p>The United States is imposing new sanctions on Sudan's de facto leader, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, following accusations that the Sudanese Armed Forces used chemical weapons during the ongoing conflict with the Rapid Support Forces. While the sanctions aim to pressure the warring parties, experts fear they will disproportionately impact civilians already facing a severe humanitarian crisis. The sanctions include export restrictions and limited access to US government credit lines, potentially exacerbating the hardship for a population grappling with displacement, famine, and sexual violence.

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Apple to manufacture iPhones in the United States or face tariffs of at least 25% on imported iPhones. Apple has resisted this pressure since 2016, opting to shift some production to countries like India. Experts suggest U.S.-based iPhone production would be costly and challenging, potentially doubling prices due to the need for automation and smaller workforce. China offers advantages such as a large, adaptable workforce and a strong engineering base. Apple's move to India is primarily to avoid import taxes, but core components still originate from China.</p>
