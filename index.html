          <p>NatWest has issued an apology after its mobile banking application experienced an outage, preventing numerous customers in the UK from accessing their accounts. The issue, which began earlier in the day, prompted many users to report problems on Downdetector, and while card payments remain unaffected, customers have expressed frustration over being unable to transfer money or conduct online shopping. NatWest has advised affected users to utilize online banking services as an alternative, though some customers have reported issues with that as well, and the bank is currently working to resolve the problem but has not provided a specific timeframe for a fix.</p>

          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, located in a Chicago suburb, was shot during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when a man, believed to be experiencing a mental health crisis, was brought to the hospital by paramedics after being approached by the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston team. While in the ER intake process, the man became agitated, leading to a confrontation with hospital staff and security, and during the struggle, the man lunged for his belongings and shots were fired, wounding one security officer, and the man was taken into custody. The hospital was briefly put on lockdown, but officials have confirmed there is no active threat.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is increasingly testing the resilience of roads, rails, and bridges worldwide, necessitating adaptations to prevent infrastructure failures. Roads are susceptible to melting and deformation, railways can buckle, and bridges face thermal expansion issues, and solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, using tree-based resins instead of petroleum-based asphalt, and painting rails white to reduce heat absorption. Bridges are being redesigned with bearings to absorb larger movements and undergo more frequent inspections, and these adaptations are vital to ensure the continued operation and safety of transport networks in a warming climate.</p>

          <p>A recent Ipsos poll indicates growing negative sentiment across major European economies, with many citizens believing their societies are broken. Germany, Great Britain, and France have seen significant increases in this sentiment since 2021, and economic concerns are contributing to populist feelings, as many believe their economies are rigged to favor the wealthy and powerful. Britons are the most likely to support a strong, rule-breaking leader as a solution, and this dissatisfaction with the status quo is fueled by declining living standards, creating pressure on the governing Labour Party as it faces challenges from right-wing parties.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares saw a rise in premarket trading following a significant drop triggered by recent tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The stock had experienced a $152 billion decrease a day earlier, and analysts are attributing the premarket recovery to reports that Trump has scheduled a call with Musk to negotiate a truce. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives suggests that a reconciliation between Musk and Trump would be beneficial for Tesla shares, which he believes were oversold due to the conflict.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the food additive titanium dioxide, especially in nanoparticle form, may have more toxic effects than previously understood, and the study indicates that it could disrupt the body's endocrine system, affecting hormonal responses to food and blood sugar levels. The EU banned titanium dioxide for food use in 2022 due to concerns about its potential as a neurotoxin and immunotoxin, and the new research compared mice fed titanium dioxide nanoparticles, microparticles, and no titanium dioxide, finding that nanoparticles led to lower levels of gut hormones and higher glucose levels. Public health groups have filed a petition with the FDA to ban its use in food.</p>

          <p>Three years after winning a $1.3 billion defamation suit against Alex Jones, the Sandy Hook families are still awaiting payment, facing further delays in federal bankruptcy court. The judge in the case expressed frustration with the drawn-out proceedings, but appeared to reconsider how Jones' company, Free Speech Systems, should be sold. Jones' lawyers are pushing for another bankruptcy auction, and the families' attorneys expressed concern that the delays are diminishing the funds available to them. Jones declared bankruptcy after being found liable for spreading conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting.</p>

The scale of agriculture in this northern location is surprising, considering the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby, and the discovery underscores the extent and sophistication of Indigenous farming practices before European colonization.</p>
