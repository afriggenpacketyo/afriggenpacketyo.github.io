          <p>Representative Gerry Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has announced his impending resignation and will not seek reelection due to the recurrence of esophageal cancer. Connolly, who was first elected in 2009, will step down from his leadership role on the Oversight Committee. He expressed pride in his accomplishments during his 30 years in public service. Connolly had previously announced his cancer diagnosis six months ago and underwent treatment, but recent developments indicate the cancer has returned, prompting his decision to focus on his health and spend time with his family.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating violent crime and fentanyl use, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, is deploying National Guard troops to Albuquerque. This decision comes amid growing concerns over the city's inability to effectively combat the crisis using traditional law enforcement methods. The National Guard will assist the strained police force in addressing the surge in crime, particularly in the International District, known locally as the "War Zone". This move highlights the severity of the situation, prompting the governor to seek additional resources to ensure public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts anticipate that home equity loan interest rates will remain relatively stable in the near term, influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. While the Fed is projected to make two rate cuts later in the year, rates on home equity loans and HELOCs are expected to hold steady for the time being. Homeowners considering tapping into their equity may find HELOCs more attractive due to their lower rates compared to home equity loans. However, borrowers should be cautious of the variable interest rates associated with HELOCs and ensure they have a plan for actively paying down the principal to avoid accumulating excessive interest charges.

          <p>A study led by Brazilian researchers has found a link between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased rates of premature death. The investigation, analyzing data from eight countries, revealed a linear association between the amount of dietary energy derived from ultraprocessed foods and the risk of mortality from any cause. Countries with stronger food cultures and less infiltration by ultraprocessed foods tend to have lower premature death rates. The study suggests that public policy overhauls and food system improvements are crucial for promoting healthier dietary patterns and reducing mortality.</p>

          <p>Settling a debt, while providing immediate relief, may not improve your credit score in the short term and could even cause a temporary dip. Settled accounts are often marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full," which can negatively impact your creditworthiness. However, if the account was already delinquent, settling the debt can be a step toward rebuilding credit over time. Alternatives like debt management plans and debt consolidation may offer more credit-score-friendly options for debt relief.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance for a new presidency since the 1970s. The S&P 500's 7.9% drop is the second-worst first 100-day performance since the beginning of President Richard Nixon's second term. The stock drawdown contrasts with the initial post-election rally, fueled by hopes for tax cuts and deregulation. Investors are now concerned about Trump's aggressive approach to trade and the potential for a recession.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8-10, coinciding with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations.
