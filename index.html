          <p>President Trump stated that Iran gave the U.S. "early notice" before launching missile strikes on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, minimizing the impact of the attack. He described Iran's response to the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as "very weak," suggesting a de-escalation of tensions. Trump also announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, though neither country has confirmed it. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack was anticipated and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing for it over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana NPR station, Red River Radio, is facing potential closure due to proposed federal funding cuts, which would impact rural communities that rely on the station for news and emergency information. The station serves East Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, providing vital news coverage to areas with limited access to other news sources. The loss of funding could have a significant impact, particularly during hurricane season when residents depend on public radio for life-saving information. The article emphasizes the importance of public radio as a lifeline for those without internet access or the means to afford satellite TV or cable.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland. The decision reverses a lower court order that required migrants to have a chance to argue they could be tortured or killed if removed to third countries. The court's three liberal justices dissented, calling the decision a "gross abuse" and stating it rewards lawlessness. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the true impact of the U.S. military operation against Iran's nuclear facilities, dubbed “Operation Midnight Hammer.” While President Trump claimed the operation "completely and totally obliterated" Iran’s nuclear capability, experts suggest the damage is significant but not complete. Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles may have been relocated, and Iranian leaders have not indicated a willingness to surrender their nuclear program. The strikes may push Iran to abandon UN restrictions and accelerate weaponization efforts, potentially worsening the situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have sparked bipartisan efforts in Congress to reassert its power to declare war. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson believes the push is now irrelevant due to Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Top Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, said they were still in the dark about Trump's decision to bomb the nuclear sites, even as Iran launched retaliatory strikes. Jeffries accused the president of potentially misleading the public and wants to know what the administration is hiding.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden places. This decision pauses a ruling by a federal judge who said immigrants deserved a "meaningful opportunity" to bring claims that they would face the risk of torture, persecution, or death if removed to certain countries. The court's conservative majority offered no explanation for its decision, while the dissenting justices accused the court of "rewarding lawlessness."</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive, Rusty Braziel, stated that he doubts Iran will close off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. Braziel argues that Iran has too much to lose by closing the strait, as it exports 1.7 million barrels a day through it. He also noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped following the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Braziel warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>

While the practice is supported by local governments seeking to meet economic targets, it has drawn criticism from industry leaders and state media, calling for regulatory action to restore order.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, many Trump voters expressed support, viewing the actions as consistent with protecting American interests. While some high-profile supporters accused Trump of betraying the MAGA movement, most voters interviewed believed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. These voters trusted Trump's leadership and his access to national security intelligence, with many also rejecting the argument that the military action required Congressional approval. The voters' support for Trump's decision stems from a belief that he will prioritize American interests and prevent prolonged regional conflict.</p>

The situation mirrors the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, where limited retaliation led to de-escalation.
