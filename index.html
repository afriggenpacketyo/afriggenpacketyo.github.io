          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza resulted in at least 72 Palestinian deaths over the weekend, including civilians in a displaced persons camp. The strikes occurred as President Trump expressed optimism about securing a ceasefire with Hamas within the week, a sentiment not yet publicly echoed by Israeli or Hamas officials. The administration has been actively pursuing a pause in the 21-month-long conflict, which has led to a severe humanitarian crisis and over 56,000 Palestinian fatalities. Negotiations have been complex, with a recent proposal involving a hostage and prisoner exchange facing hurdles.</p>

However, it also proposes deep cuts to Medicaid and eliminates the popular $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the nation's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity, following a backbench revolt that forced a U-turn on proposed welfare cuts. Speaking at a party conference, Starmer asserted that while the welfare safety net must be protected, it cannot become a "snare" preventing people from working. The government recently conceded on plans to tighten eligibility for disability payments after facing significant opposition from within its own party, though some MPs are still pushing for further changes.</p>

          <p>As the nation marks the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, a Maryland couple who were pioneers in the fight reflect on their journey. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. Although their initial legal battle was unsuccessful, it helped build momentum for change, leading to state-level legalization years later. They express pride in their role but also concern over current legal and political efforts to roll back marriage equality protections nationwide.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, driven by a de-escalation of the U.S.-Iran conflict and a resulting drop in oil prices. Initial fears of a wider war that could impact growth and inflation subsided, allowing markets to rally. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by growing expectations for multiple Federal Reserve interest rate cuts by the end of the year, despite recent inflation data being slightly hotter than anticipated. Energy prices fell sharply, easing concerns about costs for businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Supreme Court term concluded with a series of rulings that favored conservative states and bolstered President Trump's claims of executive authority, though without the blockbuster decisions of previous years. The court's 6-3 conservative majority handed wins to GOP-led states on issues like transgender medical treatments and abortion clinic funding, reflecting a states-rights approach. Concurrently, the court has repeatedly sided with the Trump administration by setting aside lower court orders that blocked his agenda, focusing on reining in judicial power while largely deferring judgment on the president's own constitutional limits.</p>

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Genetic analysis of more than 130 individuals buried under the city's houses revealed that social structures were organized around maternal lineage. Researchers found that female offspring tended to remain in the family home, while males likely moved to their wife's household upon marriage. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in the ancient world.</p>

While Russia has put a small number of captured Bradleys into service, it is unclear if this re-arming is for operational use, testing, or propaganda purposes. The U.S. has supplied over 300 Bradleys to Ukraine, where they have been effective but have also sustained heavy losses.</p>
