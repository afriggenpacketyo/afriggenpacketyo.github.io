          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. The two men, one a former parliamentary researcher, had denied providing information prejudicial to state interests between late 2021 and early 2023. The case, which Beijing had labeled as "malicious slander," was scheduled for trial in October but will no longer proceed. The reasons for the charges being dropped were not detailed in the article.</p>

The recently inaugurated African Space Agency (AfSA) in Cairo aims to foster collaboration among nations with varying levels of space expertise, from established programs in Nigeria and Egypt to newer ones in Kenya and Rwanda. This shift emphasizes using space as a practical tool for development, with significant partnerships forming with both Europe and China to advance these goals.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that a preliminary investigation found U.S. chipmaker Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly laws. The probe relates to conditions set during Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Israeli tech firm Mellanox, though specific details of the breach were not disclosed. This development adds to the escalating tech tensions between Beijing and Washington, coming just as trade talks begin and China launches separate probes into U.S. chip imports and restrictions.

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has drawn intense scrutiny over the event's security protocols. Experts and witnesses have questioned the choice of an open-air venue surrounded by buildings, the apparent lack of metal detectors, and the failure to check bags for the publicly accessible event. The gunman fired a high-powered rifle from a rooftop, a scenario that security analysts argue should have been anticipated and prevented through better planning. The university's police chief acknowledged that security measures were insufficient for the tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has launched an investigation into possible human rights violations against its citizens during a raid on a Hyundai factory in Georgia. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 workers, mostly South Koreans, for alleged visa violations, detaining them for nearly a week. The incident sparked outrage in South Korea, with President Lee Jae Myung warning it could deter future investment. In response, President Trump stated that foreign experts are welcome and that he does not want to disincentivize investment in the US.</p>

          <p>The trial of a former British paratrooper, known as Soldier F, has commenced at Belfast Crown Court for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre. He is charged with the murders of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murders of five others, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The non-jury trial marks a significant moment for the victims' families, who have campaigned for decades for justice. The case follows a lengthy public inquiry and a complex legal process, with key evidence resting on statements from other soldiers present during the event.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, is reportedly not cooperating with authorities. Utah Governor Spencer Cox stated that while the suspect remains silent, his friends and family are providing information, suggesting a possible motive rooted in "leftist ideology." Investigators are still working to confirm the motive for the attack, which occurred during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. The suspect was apprehended after a 33-hour manhunt and is being held without bail on suspicion of aggravated murder.</p>

Pence criticizes the Biden administration for not expanding the circle of peace and urges the current Trump administration to prioritize bringing Saudi Arabia into the agreement.

Trump's fascination, partly influenced by his mother's fondness for Queen Elizabeth II, provides the British government with an opportunity to exert soft power on key issues like support for Ukraine.

          <p>The trend of using topical magnesium lotion to improve sleep, a craze popularized on social media, lacks scientific backing according to medical experts. Dermatologists point out that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge, and there is little proof that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through it. Any perceived benefits are more likely attributable to the act of massage or the moisturizing properties of the lotion itself. While sleep experts say the lotion is likely harmless and may offer a powerful placebo effect, they do not recommend it over medically proven treatments for sleep conditions.</p>

          <p>Glaciers in the Swiss Alps, the source of major European rivers like the Rhine and Rhône, are melting at an accelerated rate due to climate change, threatening the continent's water supply. Scientists report that Swiss glaciers lost half their volume between 1931 and 2016, and an additional 12% in the six years that followed. This rapid loss of "nature's water towers" will alter river flows, creating water scarcity during hot, dry summers and impacting everything from shipping to agriculture. The dramatic changes are forcing industries downstream to adapt to a future with less reliable water levels.</p>

          <p>As the Women's Rugby World Cup heads into the semi-finals, England's path to the title faces formidable opposition from New Zealand, Canada, and France. Six-time champions New Zealand are timing their run perfectly, blending experienced players with exciting young talent. Canada, ranked second in the world, has a recent victory over the Black Ferns and fields a smart, cohesive team. Meanwhile, France, despite a recent loss to England, has a history of raising its performance for major tournaments and could pose a significant challenge in their upcoming semi-final match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has issued a stern warning that it will pursue legal and extra-legal action against any European state that attempts to seize its frozen sovereign assets to aid Ukraine. The threat comes after reports that the European Commission is exploring ways to use the nearly $350 billion in blocked Russian assets to finance Ukraine's defense. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that Russia would target EU states and officials "until the end of the century." Moscow considers any seizure of its assets to be theft, while European leaders argue Russia must pay for the destruction in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Despite falling to an 0-2 record after an overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants displayed a newfound offensive spark that made them surprisingly watchable. Quarterback Russell Wilson had a career-best performance with 450 passing yards, forming a potent connection with standout rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late defensive lapse, the performance was a dramatic improvement from their dismal Week 1 showing. The game offered fans a glimpse of promising young talent and a reason for hope amid another difficult start to the season.</p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a continuing shift of household savings from traditional bank deposits into the country's stock market, suggesting the recent equity rally may have further to run. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, such as brokerages and fund companies, rose by 1.17 trillion yuan. Analysts attribute this trend to low interest rates on savings accounts, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital market. The earnings yield on Chinese stocks is currently significantly more attractive than government bonds or bank deposits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 Emmy Awards ceremony was criticized for its lack of energy, largely attributed to host Nate Bargatze's repetitive central bit. Throughout the show, Bargatze threatened to deduct money from a charity donation for every second a winner's speech went overtime. This recurring gag rushed acceptance speeches, undermined genuine emotional moments, and made the charity feel like a punchline. The strategy failed to shorten the show, which was still filled with lengthy presenter scripts, and ultimately stifled the spontaneity and pageantry that are essential to a successful awards broadcast.</p>

This approach would leverage existing infrastructure, such as turbines and grid connections, potentially accelerating the country's decarbonization efforts.
