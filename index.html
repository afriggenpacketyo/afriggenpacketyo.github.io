          <p>India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called on BRICS partners to resolve significant trade imbalances with New Delhi during a virtual summit. He highlighted that India's largest trade deficits are with fellow BRICS members, particularly China and Russia, amidst the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on several nations. While India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, China and Russia see it as a geopolitical grouping. Jaishankar urged the bloc to review internal trade flows and find expeditious solutions to these deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's top court has ordered former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to serve one year in jail, ruling that his previous hospital stay did not count towards his sentence. Thaksin, who returned from exile in 2023 and received a commuted sentence, had spent only a day in jail before being moved to a hospital for six months. This decision is a fresh setback for his influential political dynasty, following his daughter Paetongtarn's recent removal from office. The case, known as the '14th floor case,' has captivated many Thais. </p>

          <p>Russia conducted its most extensive aerial strikes of the war against Ukraine over the weekend, resulting in four deaths, including a mother and her infant. Over 800 drones and 13 missiles targeted cities, including Kyiv, marking the first attack on the main government building. Analysts suggest Russia aims to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, destroy military targets, and sow panic among the population, potentially hindering recruitment efforts. This escalation indicates Moscow's disinterest in a ceasefire, with continued mass drone attacks expected.</p>

The documents also feature other contacts and photos, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for initially reporting on the letter, while an attorney for Epstein's survivors criticized Trump's actions. </p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson expressed strong opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's 'Operation Midway Blitz,' an immigration enforcement surge targeting "criminal illegal aliens" in Chicago. The mayor stated the city received no prior notice and condemned the operation as militarized enforcement without due process, citing ICE's history of human rights abuses. This federal action follows President Trump's rhetoric threatening to clean up cities, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also accusing the administration of politicizing public safety. The operation is framed by DHS as a response to sanctuary policies. </p>

          <p>A former head of security for WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, has filed a lawsuit against Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" that could compromise user privacy. Baig claims he was retaliated against after informing leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg, of issues such as 1,500 engineers having unrestricted access to user data without an audit trail. Meta disputes the allegations, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance. The lawsuit asserts that these flaws violated federal securities laws and a 2020 FTC privacy settlement, posing a significant regulatory compliance risk.</p>

The contest, set to conclude on October 25, requires candidates to secure backing from at least 80 MPs and either 5% of local parties or three affiliated groups. This election coincides with a government reshuffle perceived by some as tilting to the Right, leading to jitters within the party's soft and hard Left factions. The outcome will indicate the political direction preferred by Labour's grassroots. </p>

The meme, dubbed 'Chipocalypse Now,' parodies 'Apocalypse Now' and depicts Trump in front of a burning Chicago skyline. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the post as a threat of military operation on American soil and an attack on democracy. Trump later clarified he meant 'clean up our cities,' not 'war,' but his administration subsequently announced 'Operation Midway Blitz' for immigration enforcement in Chicago.</p>

          <p>England's NHS trusts are now subject to new league tables, publicly ranking their performance for the first time. Specialist hospitals, such as Moorfields Eye Hospital, topped the list, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, ranked lowest due to structural issues. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to identify areas needing urgent support and end the "postcode lottery" in care. Trusts will be ranked quarterly across categories including patient waiting times and financial performance, with top performers gaining autonomy and struggling ones receiving support. However, some critics question the accuracy and potential unintended consequences of the ranking system.</p>

          <p>Pop star Anastacia reflected on her unconventional rise to fame, recalling how record labels initially struggled to market her unique voice and look.

          <p>Ofsted is proceeding with its new "report card" system for inspecting schools in England, despite strong criticism from school leaders and campaigners. The new system, replacing the old one- or two-word grades, will use a five-point scale across multiple areas like curriculum, achievement, and leadership, aiming to provide more detailed information for parents. Opponents, including Ruth Perry's sister, argue the reforms are merely cosmetic and still pose risks to teacher well-being, urging a delay. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson maintains the system will improve accountability and support struggling schools. </p>

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear and dread following a Supreme Court order that permits federal agents to resume immigration raids. The ruling lifted a temporary ban on "roving patrols" where individuals were stopped based on appearance, language, and vocation. The Department of Homeland Security declared it would "FLOOD THE ZONE" in Los Angeles, despite criticism from Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom who called the decision dangerous and an attack on residents. Advocates warn of increased aggression and potential harm, noting that previous raids have led to deaths and economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older surged by 46% between 2021 and 2023, reflecting diminishing stigma and increasing legality across states. Many seniors, like Gayle Crawley and Steven Clarke, view marijuana as a solution for medicinal issues, including pain and PTSD, often preferring edibles. However, medical professionals like UC San Francisco professor Matt Springer warn of potential health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system, regardless of consumption method. Recent research links cannabis use to a doubled risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and increased risks for acute coronary syndrome and stroke.</p>

This move addresses the growing demand for durians in northeastern China, a relatively underserved market where logistics and freshness have been challenging due to distance from traditional entry points. The project is expected to handle approximately 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent units of fresh durians annually.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 519, which bans online pet dealer websites and middlemen from selling dogs to consumers, aiming to curtail the flow from out-of-state puppy mills. The bill, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, closes a loophole in a 2019 law that banned pet store sales of commercially bred dogs. It targets brokers who misrepresent themselves as local breeders, often selling sick or poorly bred pets. This measure, supported by animal welfare advocates and the Attorney General, seeks to protect consumers and enhance animal welfare standards by increasing transparency in pet sales.</p>
