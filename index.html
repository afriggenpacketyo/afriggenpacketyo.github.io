          <p>French cinema star GÃ©rard Depardieu is awaiting a verdict in his sexual assault trial, where he faces allegations from two women who claim he groped them on a film set in Paris in 2021. Depardieu denies the allegations, with the prosecutor seeking a suspended prison term, a fine, and registration as a sex offender. The defense argues for acquittal, dismissing the plaintiffs' team as overly militant. The article recounts the testimonies and arguments presented during the trial, highlighting the conflicting views on Depardieu's behavior and the legal implications. The alleged incidents occurred during the filming of 'Les Volets Verts'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the number of workers on payrolls decreasing and job vacancies declining. The unemployment rate has risen to 4.5% in the January to March period, though the ONS advises caution due to low survey response rates. Wage growth has slowed but remains higher than inflation, leading analysts to believe the Bank of England will remain cautious about future interest rate cuts despite a recent rate cut. Some firms attribute the changes to tax and the minimum wage that came into effect in April as affecting recruitment.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's Vision Fund business reported a loss for the fiscal year ending in March, driven by a 40% decrease in investment gains. While the fourth quarter saw a slight gain due to the rising value of ByteDance, the overall segment recorded a pretax loss of 115.02 billion yen. Gains from investments in companies like Didi and Coupang were offset by the declining value of other holdings, such as AutoStore. SoftBank's stock has decreased by approximately 17% this year due to market volatility and macroeconomic concerns.</p>

          <p>NHS excess weight clinics in England are seeing a disproportionate number of children from deprived areas, with some having a body mass index (BMI) over 50. A study found that many of these children are neurodivergent or have other health conditions, such as autism, learning disabilities, or liver disease. The clinics provide mental health support, dietary advice, and care for underlying conditions. Some clinics are using digital technology, such as 'smart scales' that don't display weight, to support weight loss.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is shifting its focus from operations in Europe and the Middle East to deterring Chinese aggression in the Pacific, enhancing border security, and improving missile defense. This change involves redirecting resources towards weaponry more relevant to high-intensity conflict, such as hypersonic missiles and electronic warfare systems. The Army Futures Command will merge tech innovation with training to accelerate weapons acquisitions and adopt commercial-sector contracting techniques. These reforms aim to ensure soldiers have the necessary tools to respond to future threats effectively.</p>

          <p>The ReichsbÃ¼rger are a disparate movement of conspiracy theorists in Germany who deny the legitimacy of the country's post-World War II Federal Republic. They often refuse to pay fines and taxes, and some even declare their own "national territories." Authorities have been paying increased attention to the movement in recent years amid fears of its violent potential, most notably a plot to overthrow the German government uncovered in 2022. The movement became increasingly radicalized during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
