          <p>Burberry is planning to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to save Â£60 million by 2027, adding to the Â£40 million already cut in November. The job reductions, impacting about 20% of Burberry's workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. Despite a slight sales decrease in the fiscal fourth quarter, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future, highlighting the challenges of refocusing on timeless pieces and innovating within that space. Shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, signaling investor confidence in the cost-cutting measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint investigation by The Guardian US, Consumer Reports, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network uncovered a pattern of Kroger stores overcharging customers due to expired sale prices. Secret shopper tests across multiple states revealed numerous instances where items rang up at higher prices than advertised, with expired tags averaging two weeks out of date, and customers are often unaware of these overcharges. Kroger, while acknowledging some errors, denies widespread concerns, but union officials and customers report frustration and anger over the inaccurate pricing, particularly impacting those on fixed incomes. The probe highlights broader concerns about rising food costs and the need for greater oversight of supermarket pricing practices.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify before congressional committees to discuss the Trump administration's proposed budget and the restructuring of HHS. The department has begun laying off 10,000 workers and consolidating institutes, drawing criticism for cutting positions responsible for regulating tobacco and monitoring lead exposure. Kennedy will also address concerns about his views on vaccines, following a study announced by the CDC on whether vaccines cause autism, despite his assurances of supporting vaccines during his confirmation hearings.</p>

          <p>Three Yale professors specializing in authoritarianism, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder, and Jason Stanley, are relocating to the University of Toronto due to concerns about the state of American democracy. Professor Stanley cites attacks on civil liberties under the Trump administration, while Professor Shore points to a regression of American democracy. Professor Snyder supports his wife's decision and shares concerns about the increasing difficulty of having conversations about freedom in the United States. Their departure serves as a warning about the dangers of ignoring attacks on the rule of law and democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Texas are attempting to curtail solar and wind projects in favor of new natural gas plants, despite the state's booming renewable energy sector. This move, part of a national trend, involves rolling back tax credits and tightening regulations, potentially jeopardizing billions in planned investments. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) forecasts power demand to double within five years, and restricting renewable energy sources could compound existing risks. Experts caution that new natural gas plants face global supply chain issues, making renewable energy a more viable option for meeting the state's growing energy needs.</p>
