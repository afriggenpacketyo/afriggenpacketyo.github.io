          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet reduction program, a process known as quantitative tightening. He suggested that a softening labor market is increasing the risks to employment, which could warrant future interest rate cuts to balance economic stability with inflation control. Powell emphasized the delicate task of navigating these risks, noting that while no specific timeline for rate cuts was given, the Fed is closely monitoring economic indicators to guide its upcoming policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has conducted another lethal military strike on a boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six individuals alleged to be involved in narcotrafficking. This marks the fifth such operation since September, bringing the total reported death toll to 27 as the administration designates drug traffickers as "unlawful combatants." The unprecedented use of military force against criminal organizations, rather than law enforcement interdiction, has raised questions about its legality as the Pentagon establishes a new task force to target cartels.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a ban on cooking oil trade with China as a retaliatory measure for Beijing's refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments concerning Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The dispute centers on whether the state's creation of a second majority-Black district to comply with the law constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. A ruling against the map could weaken Section 2 of the Act, which protects minority voters' ability to elect their preferred candidates, and could lead to legal challenges of voting maps nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Taliban's response to a devastating earthquake in Afghanistan has highlighted deep internal contradictions regarding the role of women in society. While some officials requested more female health workers to treat female survivors in culturally sensitive situations, others simultaneously barred female U.N. staff from reaching the affected areas. This push-and-pull reflects an ongoing struggle between pragmatic factions trying to govern effectively and hardliners imposing severe restrictions, ultimately complicating aid efforts and hindering access to care for vulnerable women and girls.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are advised to conduct a thorough review of their plans to avoid unexpected costs and coverage gaps. An expert guide recommends a five-step process: check for changes in prescription drug coverage, verify that doctors and hospitals are still in-network, and scrutinize the plan's maximum out-of-pocket costs. It is also important to review changes in copay structures and evaluate the value of supplemental benefits like dental and vision coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The union representing the controllers highlighted the immense stress this adds to an already high-pressure job, with some employees taking on second jobs to make ends meet. While controllers continue to report for duty, the situation draws parallels to the 2018-2019 shutdown, which ended after widespread flight disruptions were caused by controller shortages.</p>

Thousands of reduction-in-force notices have been issued, with the Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund—a program praised by both parties for leveraging private investment in low-income communities—being entirely eliminated. This action has drawn criticism from some Republican senators, who argue the firings are punitive and jeopardize agency missions, contradicting the administration's claims.</p>
