          <p>The England women's national football team has successfully defended its European Championship title, defeating Spain 3-1 in a tense penalty shootout. The final match was a dramatic affair, with Chloe Kelly once again playing the hero for the Lionesses. After coming off the bench, Kelly provided the assist for Alessia Russo's equalizer that forced the game into extra time. She then scored the decisive winning penalty, securing the Euro 2025 trophy and capping a triumphant tournament for the team.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential tariff escalation. The deal establishes a general 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments in the United States. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump both characterized the outcome as a significant achievement following intense negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Humanoid Robot Can Autonomously Swap its Own Batteries for Continuous Operation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese robotics company UBTech has unveiled the Walker S2, a humanoid robot designed for factory work that can operate nearly 24/7 by swapping its own batteries. When its power runs low, the robot autonomously approaches a charging station, removes the depleted battery, and inserts a fully charged one in a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation eliminates the need for human intervention in recharging, significantly increasing the robot's operational uptime. The Walker S2 is already being tested in automotive factories, signaling a major step forward in the capabilities and independence of automated labor.</p>

          <p>A significant fire has broken out in the West Midlands, UK, involving four factory units and approximately 20 tonnes of tires. More than 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines are at the scene on Great Bridge Street, between Tipton and West Bromwich. The blaze has sent a massive plume of thick smoke into the air, visible for miles, and prompted the precautionary evacuation of several nearby homes. No casualties have been reported, but emergency services have warned the public to avoid the area and for local residents to keep windows and doors closed.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of Rep. Lauren Boebert, has been charged with misdemeanor child abuse related to an incident involving his own young son.

While authorities have not released specific details, Boebert stated that no injury or physical abuse occurred and that Child Protective Services was involved. This is not Tyler Boebert's first encounter with law enforcement, as he is currently on probation for previous felony charges related to theft and identity theft.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has voiced 'deep concern' over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel of experts provides evidence-based recommendations on preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which insurers are then required to cover. The AMA defended the task force's critical, non-partisan role in public health and urged the administration to retain its current members and processes. This development follows Kennedy's previous ouster of a CDC vaccine advisory panel, fueling fears of political interference in scientific and medical institutions.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a 'fantasist' and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate scam for a massive music festival that never existed. The event, called Monmouth Rising, was billed as a 45,000-capacity festival with a lineup supposedly including The Killers and Pulp. Kenny allegedly used forged documents and false claims of major investors and government backing to deceive employees and suppliers, many of whom lost money. The investigation revealed that major bands were never booked, licenses were never applied for, and the entire event was a fabrication.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has implemented daily 10-hour 'tactical pauses' in fighting within specific areas of Gaza to create secure corridors for humanitarian aid. This decision follows mounting international pressure and severe warnings of famine and a deepening hunger crisis in the territory. While the United Nations has welcomed the move, officials emphasize that a comprehensive ceasefire is necessary to adequately address the catastrophic conditions. The pauses are intended to allow aid agencies, including the U.N., to distribute essential supplies like food and medicine to the beleaguered civilian population.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team executed a stunning defensive performance to secure a draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, keeping the series alive. Facing a significant deficit, India batted for over five sessions in their second innings, with centuries from Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar. Their unbroken 203-run partnership thwarted England's efforts on the final day. Despite a valiant effort from England's captain Ben Stokes, a crucial dropped catch and a resilient Indian side led to only the second draw for England under Stokes' captaincy.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia to negotiate an end to four days of intense border clashes that have killed at least 34 people. The talks come after diplomatic pressure from the United States, with President Trump indicating that future trade agreements could be at risk if hostilities continue. Both sides have agreed to pursue a ceasefire, though they continue to trade blame for ongoing shelling and troop movements. The conflict flared up along a long-disputed border area, displacing over 168,000 people.</p>

          <p>Colombian forward Luis Diaz is set to transfer from Liverpool to Bayern Munich after the clubs agreed to a deal worth approximately £65.5 million (€75m), including add-ons. The 28-year-old was left out of Liverpool's recent pre-season match due to the ongoing speculation about his future. Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in 2022 and has been a significant contributor, scoring 41 goals in 148 appearances and enjoying his most prolific season last year. The move comes as Liverpool reshapes its forward line with new summer signings.</p>

The Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady, but investors will scrutinize Chairman Jerome Powell's comments for clues about a potential September cut. The week will also bring the PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, and the July nonfarm payrolls report. Additionally, any developments in trade negotiations, particularly with the European Union, will be closely monitored ahead of the August 1 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marvel's 'Fantastic Four: First Steps' launched with an impressive $118 million domestically, marking another major box office success and challenging narratives of superhero fatigue. The film's strong opening follows the recent success of DC's 'Superman,' which has now surpassed $500 million at the global box office. Also crossing that milestone is Apple's 'F1,' which has become the tech giant's most successful theatrical release to date. These successes indicate that well-received, high-quality event films are still a powerful draw for audiences, providing a significant boost for studios like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have 'great pause' about any potential pardon or sentence commutation for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. In an interview, Johnson called her crimes 'unspeakable' and 'unforgivable,' suggesting her sentence was a 'pittance' and that she deserved a life sentence. While deferring the ultimate decision to the president, his comments highlight a split among Republicans. Some suggest a deal with Maxwell could yield more information about Jeffrey Epstein's network, following a recent meeting between Maxwell and the deputy attorney general.</p>

          <p>In a television interview, Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin repeatedly and incorrectly claimed that the Obama administration was responsible for Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 non-prosecution agreement. CNN's Jake Tapper corrected the senator, pointing out that the deal was negotiated in 2008 when George W. Bush was president, by a U.S. Attorney who was a Bush appointee. Despite being presented with the facts, Mullin insisted the case was sealed in 2009 under President Obama, conflating the sealing of documents with the timing of the plea deal itself. The exchange highlights ongoing political maneuvering and misinformation surrounding the Epstein case.</p>
