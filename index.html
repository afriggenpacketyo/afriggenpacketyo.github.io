          <p>In a detailed interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz reflects on the 1976-77 murder spree that terrorized New York City. He discusses his troubled childhood, his descent into violence which he attributes to demonic influence, and his current life as a born-again Christian in prison. The article provides extensive context about the fear that gripped the city at the time and includes perspectives from survivors and investigators, some of whom remain skeptical of his transformation. Berkowitz expresses remorse but offers little new information on the crimes themselves.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents in the New York City area and as far as Connecticut reported feeling brief shaking, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant. Officials compared it to the much larger 4.8 magnitude quake that rattled the region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial actions against Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent federal agency, and this investigation is a non-criminal inquiry into whether Smith engaged in prohibited political activities as a government employee.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after the brutal murder of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, leaving families and investigators without closure. The article recounts the horrific 1991 crime, the subsequent arrests and overturned convictions of four men, and the ongoing investigation. A key piece of evidence is a small sample of unidentified male DNA found on one victim, which investigators hope may one day lead to a breakthrough with advancing technology.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare capability using a swarm of drones to create an "electromagnetic storm eye." According to a peer-reviewed paper, this technology can precisely jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a null zone around friendly forces, protecting them from interference. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement from traditional omnidirectional jamming, which disrupts all signals within its range, including those of allies.</p>

Coach Sean McVay stated that the 37-year-old quarterback is "week to week" and will not participate in upcoming joint practices with the Dallas Cowboys.

He described the condition as potentially "implacably debilitating" both mentally and physically, and admitted he considered ending his tour after the diagnosis. However, he decided to continue performing, stating that the joy he gets from it outweighed the stress on his body.

          <h2>Meta Signals More Cautious Approach to Open-Source AI Amid China's Rapid Advances</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it plans to be more "careful" with its open-source strategy going forward. This shift in stance contrasts with China's booming open-source AI ecosystem, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts suggest China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source environment could be a path for it to surpass the U.S. in AI development.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of what killed a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. For decades, it was rumored the creature, named Winston, died from shell-shock during a German U-boat encounter on its voyage from Australia. However, researchers analyzing ship logs and attendant notes have determined that the platypus most likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, debunking the more dramatic wartime tale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly using large-scale theme parks as a tool to fuel consumer spending and local economic growth. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is a prime example of this strategy, adding to the nation's over 4,400 amusement facilities. Industry experts note that such attractions act as significant economic drivers, with every yuan of operating revenue generating a much larger impact on the surrounding economy through tourism, hospitality, and retail.

          <p>Kori Schake, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's approach to international relations is dangerously isolating the United States. In a Foreign Affairs article, she contends that Trump's conviction that allies are a burden ignores how American power relies on cooperation. This policy, she warns, is causing other nations to hedge against the U.S. and could lead to the collapse of a favorable international order.</p>

He explains that a formal firewall allows him to report on NPR as he would any other major news outlet, without interference from corporate or news executives.

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with insurrectionary and white nationalist ideologies. She traces a shift from legal challenges against Roe v. Wade to a rhetoric of ignoring the rule of law, a tactic she connects to the January 6 Capitol riot. The book suggests the movement has facilitated intersections among various far-right groups under a shared goal of defending a specific vision of civilization.</p>
