          <p>Ukraine's security service, the SBU, announced it had tracked and killed Russian agents allegedly responsible for the recent assassination of a high-ranking Ukrainian colonel. The officer, Ivan Voronych, was killed in a brazen daylight attack in Kyiv, an event captured on surveillance footage. The SBU stated the suspected assassins resisted arrest and were eliminated, releasing a video showing two bodies on the ground. This incident is part of a larger pattern of targeted killings and covert operations by both sides since Russia's full-scale invasion, with Moscow accusing Kyiv of similar high-profile attacks on Russian soil.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following announcements of a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer European countries rather than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration also considers imposing severe sanctions on Russia's economy and its international partners, with a proposed 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian energy. This diplomatic and military maneuvering represents a critical juncture in the Western response to the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square celebrated a significant cultural milestone by performing the 5,000th episode of its weekly program, "Music & the Spoken Word." The broadcast, which began in 1929, is the longest-running consecutive program of its kind and was attended by over 11,500 people in Salt Lake City. The choir, famously dubbed "America’s Choir" by Ronald Reagan, has been a consistent presence through major historical events like the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic. The event highlighted the program's enduring legacy and its ability to provide a source of comfort and unity for millions of listeners weekly for nearly 100 years.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Lexington, Kentucky, left three people dead, including the suspect, and three others wounded. The event began when a state trooper was shot during a traffic stop, after which the suspect carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. At the church, the gunman killed two individuals, identified as 72-year-old Beverly Gum and 32-year-old Christina Combs, and wounded two other men before being fatally shot by Lexington police. Authorities believe the shooter may have had a connection to the church victims, and the wounded trooper is reported to be in stable condition.</p>

          <p>Emergency crews in Kerr County, Texas, suspended their search for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods due to a new and severe flood threat. Heavy thunderstorms are causing the Guadalupe and San Saba Rivers to rise again, prompting new evacuation orders in several counties. The original flooding resulted in at least 129 deaths statewide, with 166 people still unaccounted for, primarily in the hard-hit Hill Country. Officials warned that the current situation is extremely dangerous, as the already saturated ground increases the risk of flash flooding, complicating the massive ongoing recovery and search operations.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew to 5,000 acres, fueled by strong winds, and also burned a water treatment facility, causing a dangerous chlorine gas leak that forced firefighter evacuations. Meanwhile, another blaze, the White Sage Fire, has scorched over 40,000 acres in the nearby Kaibab National Forest. The smoke from these and extensive Canadian wildfires is blanketing the Upper Midwest, leading to widespread unhealthy air quality alerts across several states, compounding a summer of extreme weather events.</p>

The 2024 assessment highlights that the UK is not only getting hotter, with more very warm days and fewer frosts, but also wetter, particularly in winter. This climatic shift is having tangible impacts on the natural world, affecting species and ecosystems, and increasing the risk of severe flooding and drought across the nation.</p>

          <p>King Charles has invited President Donald Trump for a state visit in September, strategically scheduled for when the UK Parliament is not in session for its party conference break. This timing effectively removes the possibility of the U.S. president addressing Parliament, an event that would have likely proven controversial given criticism from some MPs. The visit, an unprecedented second for a modern U.S. president, is seen as a diplomatic move as Prime Minister Keir Starmer continues to engage with the Trump administration on key issues like trade tariffs. The arrangement avoids a potential political flashpoint while still affording the honor of a state visit.</p>

Artists like Rob Vanderslice, once involved in gang culture, now mentor at-risk youth, teaching them to build lowrider bicycles as a positive outlet.

The city's diversified economy means it is no longer solely dependent on the gaming industry, and it continues to attract buyers with its favorable tax structure and lifestyle amenities.

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino declared the expanded Club World Cup a "huge success," highlighting revenues over $2 billion and the close support of President Donald Trump. The tournament culminated in a final that was a victory for Chelsea, FIFA's finances, and Trump's political visibility. However, the event has drawn criticism from figures like coach Jürgen Klopp over player exhaustion, an issue exacerbated by extreme heat during some matches. In response, FIFA announced new player welfare measures, including mandatory rest periods, as it looks ahead to hosting the 2026 World Cup in North America.</p>

The allegations, first made public by a provincial police chief, include claims of interference in political killing investigations and receiving financial support from a corrupt businessman.

          <p>In a recent address, financial analyst Jim Cramer urged investors to divorce their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly concerning the Trump presidency. He argued that despite widespread personal dislike for the president, the current economic environment is surprisingly bullish for the stock market, driven by individual investors rather than institutions. Cramer posits that a combination of deregulation, a pro-business stance, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence is creating conditions for market growth, even with potentially inflationary tariffs. He suggests that investors who focus on these underlying economic forces stand to benefit regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash followed a Justice Department memo stating there was no "incriminating client list" or evidence of blackmail, a finding that disappointed those expecting major revelations. In a social media post, Trump urged critics to "let Pam Bondi do her job," as prominent conservative figures and allies voiced frustration over what they perceive as a lack of transparency. The feud highlights a growing public division over the politically sensitive investigation into the deceased sex offender.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," a raw and quirky R&B project that marks a departure from his more polished pop work. The 21-track LP features a cooled-out, improvisatory feel, with collaborators like Mk.gee and Dijon contributing to its murky, chillwave-influenced sound. The album comes after a period of personal and professional change for the 31-year-old artist, and its messy, authentic vibe reflects this tumult. With this release, Bieber aligns himself with the idiosyncratic style of modern pop stars who favor pursuing odd impulses over a streamlined vision, resulting in a disarming and often beautiful collection.</p>

The attack is part of an escalating conflict that has led to famine, claims of genocide, and the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

He emphasized the need for France to be powerful to be feared, pointing to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainty from the United States as key dangers.
