          <p>Luxury fashion firm Burberry is planning to cut 1,700 jobs as part of a cost-reduction strategy aimed at saving £60 million by 2027. The British designer brand reported a £66 million loss in the last financial year, prompting the organizational changes that will impact roughly 20% of its global workforce, primarily in office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. CEO Joshua Schulman aims to revive the brand's fortunes through these measures, following £40 million in cost-cutting announced previously. Shares of Burberry jumped 8.5% after the announcement, reflecting investor optimism about the turnaround plan.</p>

          <p>A rock climber, Anton Tselykh, survived a 400-foot fall in Washington's North Cascades mountains that killed his three companions. Despite suffering internal bleeding and head trauma, Tselykh hiked to his car and called for help after extricating himself from the accident scene. The climbers, Vishnu Irigireddy, Tim Nguyen, and Oleksander Martynenko, died when the anchor securing their ropes failed. The incident occurred as the group descended the Early Winters Spires, a popular climbing spot, and authorities believe an old piton used as an anchor gave way. The search and rescue team recovered the bodies by helicopter due to the rough terrain.</p>

          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list, ESPN's Tony Kornheiser clarified that Rose's reinstatement does not guarantee entry into the Hall of Fame. Kornheiser emphasized that baseball writers, known as guardians of the game, hold the power to vote players into the Hall. He noted that Rose's gambling on games as a manager, as well as Joe Jackson's fixing games, are serious violations that writers consider. Kornheiser added that other players with controversial pasts, such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, are also eligible but have not been voted in, although he personally would put Rose in the Hall of Fame while acknowledging his sins on the plaque.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation by the Guardian US, Consumer Reports, and the Food & Environment Reporting Network reveals that Kroger stores are frequently overcharging customers by listing expired sale prices on shelves and ringing up regular prices at checkout. Secret shopper tests in multiple states found expired tags resulting in overcharges in 14 of 26 stores reviewed, with average overcharges of about $1.70 per item. The investigation also found that Kroger's sale tags often lack clear expiration dates, leading to customer confusion. Union officials attribute the problem to chronic understaffing, which prevents employees from removing expired tags, while Kroger denies the claims of widespread pricing concerns.</p>

Borrowers have the option to contest the offset by proving financial hardship or having a pending student loan discharge.

          <p>The Trump administration's recent actions, including the firing of FEMA's acting director and proposed budget cuts, are raising concerns about the agency's ability to respond to climate-change-fueled disasters. The administration seeks to shift more disaster response responsibilities to the states, which experts argue are ill-equipped to handle increasingly frequent and severe events. The potential funding shortfall at FEMA could leave millions of Americans vulnerable, and the elimination of programs like Americorps and Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities further weakens the federal disaster-response infrastructure. Critics argue that these actions will disproportionately impact individuals and local governments, leaving them to self-finance recovery efforts.</p>

Melkonyants, who pleaded not guilty, was arrested after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine and initiated a broad crackdown on dissent. Golos, which documented widespread election fraud, was labeled a “foreign agent” by Russian authorities in 2013.</p>

          <p>A bag containing an inflammable signal flame tube fell from a U.S. military helicopter over the Motobu peninsula in northern Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The local Defense Ministry bureau reported the incident, stating that no damage has been reported. A U.S. Marine Corps official confirmed that the UH-1 helicopter inadvertently dropped the 18-kilogram bag during a routine drill and that no civilians were in the area where it landed. Japanese officials have urged the U.S. military to take thorough steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, while the Okinawa governor expressed regret that the incident caused concern among local residents.</p>

          <p>A court ruled that the European Union should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer’s chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court rejected the commission’s argument that text messages are “short-lived” and do not contain important information. The case centered on whether Ms. von der Leyen’s text messages were covered by E.U. transparency laws and should have potentially been released. The New York Times, which sought the messages, hailed the ruling as a victory for transparency and accountability.</p>

As of Wednesday, shipments arriving from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800 could face 54 percent tariffs. The new tariffs are disrupting the economics of global trade, with factory owners in Guangzhou reporting fewer orders due to higher prices. The trade war poses a challenge for China, where economic growth has been largely driven by exports.

Wildberger's powers are significant: essentially, anything that involves administering the state's IT infrastructure is now under Wildberger's oversight.

The possibility of an Air Force One with Qatari heritage has inspired a backlash, but Trump has shrugged off the criticism.

While current guidelines recommend short-term use, many patients remain on these medications for extended periods, leading to physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid tapering can result in severe withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts. New guidelines from the American Society of Addiction Medicine emphasize the importance of slow tapering and individualized treatment plans, but many doctors remain undertrained in managing benzodiazepine withdrawal.</p>
