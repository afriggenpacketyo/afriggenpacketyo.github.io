        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, reducing the deposit facility rate to 2% from a mid-2023 high of 4%. This decision follows a drop in Euro zone inflation to 1.9% in May, which is below the ECB's 2% target. The ECB cited its updated assessment of the inflation outlook and the strength of monetary policy transmission as reasons for the rate trim. However, economic growth in the Euro zone remains sluggish, with a first-quarter expansion of only 0.3%, and rising geopolitical tensions, including U.S. tariff policies, add further uncertainty to the economic outlook.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing travel restrictions on nationals from a dozen countries and partial restrictions on seven others, citing national security concerns. The order fully bans entry for foreigners from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while partially suspending entry for travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Exemptions are included for U.S. permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens with sufficient evidence, Afghans who assisted American forces, diplomats, athletes, and dual nationals. This ban follows an attack in Boulder, Colorado, by an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, prompting officials to assess Egypt's vetting policies.</p>

The government has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029, and it also pledged Â£13m to food charities across England.

          <p>A new report indicates that China is quickly gaining an edge over the U.S. in biotechnology, particularly in drug and agricultural development. The Harvard Belfer Center's "Critical and Emerging Technologies Index" suggests that biotechnology is the sector where China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States. This assessment echoes growing concerns in Washington, with the U.S. National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology urging the government to invest at least $15 billion over the next five years to bolster the domestic biotech sector. U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies have recently invested billions to acquire China-developed drugs, signaling the industry's progress.</p>

Yang criticizes Democrats for not addressing these concerns effectively and suggests they should learn from figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who directly address economic issues. Focus groups have shown that young voters view progressives as authentic fighters for their economic well-being, while others, like Kamala Harris, are seen as inauthentic.

          <p>The U.S. is pushing for NATO members to increase their defense spending to 5% of their respective GDPs, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This move aligns with President Trump's demands to raise the current target of 2% amidst ongoing security concerns. While some NATO members have exceeded the 2% target, others, including major economies like Canada, Spain, and Italy, have lagged behind. The need for higher defense spending is driven by the threat of Russia's war in Ukraine and the need to confront other global challenges.</p>

Abdel-Fattah has been imprisoned for around a decade, and the UNWGAD argues that his imprisonment is due to his exercise of freedom of expression. Abdel-Fattah's mother, Leila Soueif, has been on hunger strike for approximately 250 days in support of her son's release, and her health has deteriorated significantly.

          <p>While best friendships can be a source of joy and support for children, experts say they are not essential for well-being. Kids with best friends tend to be less anxious, better able to handle rejection, and more engaged in school, but pressure to have a best friend can also be stressful. Children need a repertoire of anchors, people who provide different kinds of support, and having a group of reliable friends is more important than having one particular best friend. The message is that kids don't need a certain kind of best-friendship, or even a best friend at all.</p>
