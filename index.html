            <h2>Japan Sees Rise in "Friendship Marriages" Outside Traditional Societal Norms</h2>

            <p>A growing number of couples in Japan are entering into nonsexual "friendship marriages" for practical advantages like social security benefits, despite contradicting their sexual orientations. These arrangements involve couples who have no romantic feelings or sexual desire for each other, but seek companionship and societal acceptance. One Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade. Experts suggest that friendship marriages may be a response to the lack of legal recognition for same-sex marriage and the persistent societal pressure to marry and have children.</p>

            <p>Following a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Vladimir Putin, Ukraine and Russia exchanged accusations of ceasefire violations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported nearly 3,000 Russian breaches since Sunday, with heavy shelling near Pokrovsk. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults and accused Kyiv of drone and shell attacks. Despite the mutual accusations, US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, without providing specific details on potential negotiations. This comes after Trump threatened to pull out of brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks.</p>

            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year at 3.6%, as it focuses on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The decision comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data for the first quarter, with GDP growing at 5.4% year-on-year. This allows the PBOC room to keep rates steady and focus on currency stability as Trump tariffs pressure the yuan. The Chinese onshore yuan was trading flat following the announcement.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that while Donald Trump's tariffs pose a challenge to China, they could also force the country to address its economic weaknesses and become more resilient. The author suggests that China is preparing for a long-term economic conflict with the U.S. and recognizes that America's strategic goal is to hinder China's economic growth. Instead of relying on brute strength, China may focus on improving its inner balance and core strength to overcome the larger opponent. Resolving the fragmentation of China's domestic market is key to withstanding external pressures.</p>

            <p>Despite government promises to reform childcare in England, parents are still facing difficulties finding nursery places and navigating the "free hours" scheme. Many areas are considered "childcare deserts" with low accessibility, disproportionately affecting deprived areas. While the government estimates an additional 70,000 places and 35,000 staff will be needed by September, experts are concerned about a widening gap between eligible and ineligible families. Private nurseries, which provide most early years places, are facing increasing operating costs, leading to potential challenges in offering the funded hours.</p>

            <p>Studies show that men visit general practitioners less frequently than women, often delaying medical attention until symptoms become severe. This reluctance is attributed to societal pressures to "tough it out," concerns about appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns. Experts suggest redesigning services to better meet men's needs, focusing on action-oriented approaches rather than open discussions. The article highlights the importance of addressing these barriers to improve men's health outcomes and encourage preventative care.</p>

            <p>The WWF and Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) have developed AI-powered cameras to detect snow leopards and warn villagers to move livestock to safety. The cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan, aim to reduce retaliatory killings of snow leopards for livestock losses. The project has faced challenges, including community skepticism and technical difficulties in the high-altitude environment. WWF hopes that by preventing conflicts between humans and snow leopards, the technology will contribute to the conservation of the endangered species.</p>

Their comments aligned with Trump’s latest round of tariffs, announced just days earlier, that rocked the markets and raised fears of a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>
