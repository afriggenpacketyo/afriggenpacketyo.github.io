          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a 'camp area,' marking a symbolic downgrading of the former Kuomintang leader's legacy. The mausoleum of his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was also reclassified. This move reflects the island's independence-leaning authorities' efforts to redefine historical narratives and update administrative designations, as Taoyuan was reclassified as a metropolitan area in 2014. The sites will no longer be referred to as 'mausoleums' or 'spirit-worship facilities.'</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist, critiques Stephen Miran's plan to weaken the dollar, arguing that it oversimplifies the causes of America's trade deficits. Rogoff acknowledges that the dollar's reserve-currency status can inflate its value, but contends that other factors, such as fiscal deficits and the strength of the American economy, also play significant roles. He points out that the US ran current account surpluses when the dollar was already the reserve currency. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more effective solution than initiating a trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving the White House, Joe Biden spoke with the BBC about his concerns regarding Donald Trump's foreign policy decisions, particularly those concerning Ukraine and NATO. Biden criticized Trump's suggestion that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as 'modern-day appeasement,' fearing it could embolden Putin and undermine the solidarity of the Atlantic Alliance. Biden also expressed worry that European leaders might lose confidence in American leadership and question the reliability of the United States, emphasizing the importance of fighting for democracy in every generation. Biden stated that he believes the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about. The interview took place just before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, adding historical context to Biden's concerns about global alliances.</p>

          <p>India launched military strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it described as 'terrorist infrastructure' in response to a militant attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people. The Indian government stated that the strikes were measured and non-escalatory, aimed at sites used for planning attacks against India. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war and asserted its right to respond, leading to heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. The strikes were labeled 'Operation Sindoor,' a reference to a red-colored powder mostly worn by Indian Hindu married women.</p>

However, the report also acknowledges the human cost of WWII and the contrast between the Soviet Union's fight against Nazi invasion and Russia's current invasion of Ukraine. The piece explores how the Russian government uses television and monuments to reinforce its message and promote a sense of national pride and historical continuity.</p>

The voicemails contained angry and accusatory messages, including Read saying 'I f---ing hate you' and accusing him of being a 'f---ing pervert.'

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting raids targeting businesses in Washington, D.C., focusing on restaurants and delivery services. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern about the reports, stating that ICE appears to be targeting neighborhoods and disrupting the community. Activist groups warned of the planned enforcement, suggesting ICE may be using President Trump's executive order on the 'beautification' of the capital as justification for the raids. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern about the impact on the industry, highlighting the significant role of immigrants in the workforce.</p>

          <p>New legislation is being introduced in England and Wales that would allow judges to impose an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot evade justice and must face the consequences of their actions. The families of victims who have been affected by offenders' absence from sentencing have campaigned for this change in the law. The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States and the Houthis in Yemen have reached a deal to halt American airstrikes in exchange for the group ceasing attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea.

The deal has been portrayed as a victory for the Houthis, and questions remain about whether it will effectively stop the group from impeding international shipping. The announcement also surprised Pentagon officials and comes as the US is working to negotiate a deal to curb Iranâ€™s nuclear ambitions.</p>
