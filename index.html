          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 propelled England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, recovering the team from a shaky start at 93-4. Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total of 308, but dropped catches proved costly for the visitors.

Despite a federal court ruling that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the duties, officials express confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold the tariffs. The administration argues that overturning the tariffs would undermine negotiating leverage with other nations. If the tariffs are blocked, the administration suggests it will pursue other alternatives to ensure fair trade, but details remain vague. (not investment advice)</p>
