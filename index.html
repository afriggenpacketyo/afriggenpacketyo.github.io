          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal to sign England center-back Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, marking a significant move on the transfer deadline day. The transfer, however, is pending final clearance from Crystal Palace as they seek a replacement. This signing is part of Liverpool's record-breaking summer spending spree, which has exceeded £450 million, aimed at reinforcing their squad after concerns about their defense early in the season. The deal underscores the intense financial activity in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which requires school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of classic novels, including Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale." In her new story, Atwood critiques the ban and its supporters, including Premier Danielle Smith, highlighting a growing cultural debate over censorship in Canadian schools, a trend that has migrated from the United States.</p>

A significant £10 billion warship order from Norway to the U.K. boosted shares for defense companies like BAE Systems. Simultaneously, Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk saw its stock rise following trial data suggesting its drug Wegovy is highly effective in reducing heart disease risks compared to competitors.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism from the Conservative party over her past property dealings. The controversy centers on allegations that she may have avoided paying the correct amount of tax on a flat she purchased by misrepresenting her primary residence. While there is no suggestion of illegal activity, the issue has led to accusations of hypocrisy and calls for an investigation. Starmer dismissed the criticism as a politically motivated attempt to undermine Rayner.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Activities Caused Divergent Size Evolution in Wild and Domesticated Animals</h2>

          <p>A recent study by French scientists reveals that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domestic animals. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones found that while domesticated species like sheep and chickens grew larger due to selective breeding, wild species such as foxes and deer shrank. This shrinking is attributed to habitat loss and intensified hunting. The findings underscore the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world's evolutionary paths.</p>

          <p>The popular Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has generated intense online debate among fans, but this enthusiasm has increasingly turned into toxic behavior directed at the show's actors. The fan base is fiercely divided over the main character's romantic choices, leading to online harassment and threats. In response, Prime Video launched a campaign urging kindness, and the show's stars have spoken out about the need to distinguish fiction from reality. A psychiatrist weighs in, suggesting this behavior may reflect a broader societal issue of blurred lines and parasocial relationships.</p>

          <p>A new documentary film, "The Haydn Expedition," showcases the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, an orchestra renowned for its unique and successful democratic organizational structure. Founded by music students in 1980, the orchestra allows all its musicians to have a say in key decisions, from repertoire selection to the choice of conductor. This collaborative approach, combined with financial independence, is credited with fostering a deep sense of ownership and motivation among its members. The film highlights how this model has propelled the orchestra, under the artistic direction of Paavo Järvi, to become one of the world's leading ensembles.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has officially confirmed that the summer of 2025 was the hottest ever recorded in the UK, with a mean temperature of 16.10°C. This temperature is significantly above the long-term average and surpasses the previous record set in 2018. Climate scientists note that a summer this hot is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change, with all five of the UK's hottest summers occurring since the year 2000. The season was characterized by prolonged and widespread heatwaves, contributing to exceptionally dry conditions in many parts of England.</p>

          <p>A controversial post-war redevelopment plan for Gaza, dubbed the "Gaza Riviera," is reportedly being considered by the Trump administration. The 38-page document outlines a U.S. trusteeship over the territory for at least a decade, featuring the construction of AI-powered smart cities and the "voluntary" relocation of Gaza's two million residents. In this plan, displaced Palestinians would receive digital tokens in exchange for their property rights. The proposal, which has drawn sharp criticism for its potential to constitute mass displacement, aims to transform the war-torn enclave into a tourism and tech hub financed by private investment.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has agreed to a deal to send striker Nicolas Jackson to German club Bayern Munich. The transfer will initially be a loan for £14.3 million, but it includes a mandatory purchase clause for £56.2 million, triggered by a minimum number of appearances. The total value of the deal exceeds £70 million. Jackson, who joined Chelsea in 2023, reportedly lost the trust of the club's management after disciplinary issues, prompting his departure. In a related move, Chelsea has signed Argentine forward Facundo Buonanotte on loan from Brighton to reinforce their attacking options.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies could severely damage key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy. Industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are heavily reliant on an immigrant workforce, including a large number of undocumented workers. The research, from the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced, estimates that mass deportations and stricter border controls could result in a loss of up to $278 billion from the state's GDP. The findings highlight the critical role immigrant labor plays in sustaining California's economic output amid a declining birthrate and aging population.</p>

The shallow depth of the quake contributed to its destructive power.

Iran has stated it will not alter its position and is considering withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty in response.
