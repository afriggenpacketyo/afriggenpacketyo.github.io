          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, stating the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a TPS designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants have built lives in the U.S. based on the existing timeline, while the administration argued conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return.</p>

Despite a large majority, the government lacked control of the situation, leading to a last-minute climbdown to avoid a parliamentary defeat. The chaotic episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, raised questions about his cabinet's competence, and created internal party friction just months into his tenure.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the financial strain of 153 clergy sexual abuse claims. Church officials state the move is necessary to manage the claims equitably while continuing their ministry, but attorneys for the survivors criticize it as a delay tactic to evade accountability. The bankruptcy filing will consolidate the legal proceedings, shifting the focus from individual trials to a court-managed fund for distributing compensation to victims of abuse.</p>
