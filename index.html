          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been hospitalized with serious injuries, including fractured thoracic vertebrae, after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. A spokesperson confirmed the injuries and stated the crash was not a targeted attack. The incident occurred after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was a victim of domestic violence. His son, Andrew Giuliani, described his father as the "toughest SOB" he knows while thanking the public for their support.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the death of Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, in an aerial attack on a residential building in Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation as a "flawless execution," while Hamas has not yet confirmed the death. The strike, which also resulted in civilian casualties according to local reports, targeted an apartment where Obeida was believed to be hiding. Obeida was a well-known, masked figure who delivered propaganda speeches for the al-Qassam Brigades.</p>

          <p>At least two arrests were made in Epping, Essex, during a protest against the housing of approximately 140 asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel. Around 200 people gathered for an organized march, leading to clashes with police who had a dispersal order in place. Tensions in the area have been high since an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl, a case which is currently proceeding through the courts. A recent Court of Appeal decision overturned an injunction that would have blocked the hotel's use for housing asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton has been given a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza after failing to slow sufficiently under double yellow flags during the Dutch Grand Prix. This penalty compounds a difficult weekend for Ferrari, which saw both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crash out of the race in separate incidents. The penalty, reduced from a potential ten places because he did attempt to slow down, means the seven-time world champion will start no higher than sixth in his first home race for the Italian team.</p>

In response, the Trent Rockets' chase was derailed by leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three crucial wickets for just three runs. Despite a late charge from Marcus Stoinis, the Rockets fell short, solidifying the Invincibles' dominance in the competition.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs, deeming them illegal. In response, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro stated that it would be "the end of the United States" if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, where the administration plans to appeal. The administration argues the tariffs are crucial for the nation's economic and military strength, a claim disputed by analyses suggesting they primarily burden American consumers.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The order from U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff in Texas. Immigrant rights advocates argued the deportations would be illegal, depriving minors of their right to seek asylum and other humanitarian protections under U.S. law. The administration claimed it was repatriating the children at their families' request, a narrative the judge found conflicted with reports from the children's lawyers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order requiring identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that would likely face immediate and significant constitutional challenges. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president in this area. This initiative is part of Trump's broader push for voting reforms, stemming from his baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy. This tragic event highlights recent government warnings about declining vaccine uptake, with none of the main childhood vaccines in England meeting the 95% target last year. Health officials are re-emphasizing the critical importance of the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant women to provide passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their first jab at eight weeks old.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. While the grand prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including a $1 million ticket sold in Worcester, Massachusetts. This marks the fortieth consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, with the last major prize being hit on May 31. The current jackpot is the largest since a $1.326 billion prize was won in Oregon in April 2024, driving high interest for the next drawing on Monday night.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have raided the offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF in Sanaa, Yemen, detaining at least one employee. The raids occurred shortly after an Israeli airstrike killed the Houthi prime minister, Ahmed al-Rahawi, and several other cabinet members. While it is unclear if the events are directly related, the Houthis have a history of targeting international organizations. The UN has condemned the detentions and forced entry, prioritizing the safety of its staff as it seeks more information from local authorities.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is pushing back against President Trump's criticism of crime in Baltimore, stating he has "no interest in fighting with the president, but I have an interest in fighting for my communities." The feud escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore rebuffed. Moore touted recent drops in crime as evidence of a "great American turnaround story" and called the president's comments arrogant and cynical. He argued that federal support should come through funding for local law enforcement, not a "performative" military deployment.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers held informal talks in Copenhagen to brainstorm new ways to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" sites for Ukrainian arms production on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian soil in the event of a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, described in this sports analysis as one of the worst in recent memory. The article credits Rangers with showing fight and resilience, a welcome change for the beleaguered club, but notes Celtic's attacking play was remarkably feeble and lacking in creativity. Both teams face significant challenges, with Rangers needing to build on the defensive solidity and Celtic requiring an urgent overhaul of its squad to regain its offensive prowess before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>An article from The Economist examines the potential ramifications of a second Donald Trump presidency on America's public universities, institutions he has frequently targeted in his political rhetoric. The piece suggests that a Trump administration could intensify the culture wars on campus, potentially leading to federal funding cuts, challenges to academic freedom, and increased political pressure on university governance. The analysis frames this as part of a broader conservative movement questioning the value and political leanings of higher education, with flagship public universities like UCLA and Berkeley at the center of the debate.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread and sometimes violent anti-government protests, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has announced that political parties have agreed to reduce certain state-funded perks for politicians. The unrest was largely fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. President Prabowo stated that some allowances would be curtailed and a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed. However, student groups have called the concessions insufficient, suggesting that demonstrations could continue.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects has successfully revived a vital underwater ecosystem off the coast of Southern California by culling millions of purple sea urchins. The Bay Foundation has led an effort over 13 years, with divers smashing nearly 6 million ravenous urchins that had created barren underwater landscapes. This has allowed the giant Pacific kelp, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species. The successful project serves as a potential model for restoring other struggling kelp forests around the globe.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party, if elected, will remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies to maximize fossil fuel extraction from the North Sea. Badenoch is set to argue that climate-related measures are a burden on producers that ultimately lead to higher energy bills for consumers. The plan represents a significant shift in climate policy and stands in stark contrast to the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. Environmental groups have criticized the proposal as "reckless environmental vandalism."</p>
