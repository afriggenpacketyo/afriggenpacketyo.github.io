          <p>A federal court has begun hearing arguments regarding Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's lawsuit argues that Trump lacks the legal cause required to remove a Fed governor, challenging his move based on allegations of mortgage fraud. Trump's legal team contends that the president has the discretion to determine what constitutes "cause" and that the decision is not subject to judicial review. The case, which could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, raises significant questions about the independence of the central bank and presidential authority over its board.</p>

          <p>A recent policy push by President Trump to continue allowing large numbers of Chinese students to obtain U.S. visas is raising national security concerns among some experts. Critics, such as China policy expert Michael Sobolik, warn that the Chinese Communist Party could exploit this policy to advance malign influence operations, including espionage and the theft of American intellectual property from universities. The Trump administration has defended the move, suggesting it is a continuation of existing policy and necessary to prevent financial harm to U.S. colleges. This debate highlights the tension between economic interests in higher education and potential national security vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Yoga has evolved from an ancient wellness practice into a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has successfully projected the practice as a symbol of Indian cultural identity worldwide. Experts note that yoga's non-controversial and universal appeal allows India to build influence quietly, fostering people-to-people connections that are often stronger than state-level ties. However, the article also addresses criticisms regarding the practice's over-commercialization in the West and concerns that its association with political agendas in India could undermine its spiritual essence and universal character.</p>

          <h2>Kyle Schwarber's Historic Four-Homer Game Avoids Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 10:38:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves. He became only the 21st player to achieve this feat and had an opportunity to be the first ever to hit a fifth, but popped out in his final at-bat. The article notes that this final out averted potential controversy, as it came against a position player, Vidal Bruján, who was pitching in the blowout game. Hitting a historic fifth home run off a non-pitcher lobbing slow pitches would have likely drawn criticism and questions about the record's legitimacy amid the growing debate over position players pitching.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted celebrity crocodile wrangler Matt Wright on two counts of perverting the course of justice related to a 2022 helicopter crash that killed his co-star, Chris Wilson. Wright, known for his series "Wild Croc Territory," was found to have lied to police about the aircraft's fuel level and encouraged the injured pilot to falsify flight records. The crash occurred during a crocodile egg collection operation when the helicopter, with Wilson dangling below, ran out of fuel. Wright has expressed disappointment with the verdict and plans to appeal, while the victim's widow described the day as an important moment in a painful journey.</p>

          <p>Mass protests and clashes with police have broken out in major Indonesian cities after a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver, Affan Kurniawan, was killed by a police vehicle during a demonstration. The initial protests were focused on cost-of-living issues and opposition to housing perks for politicians, but Kurniawan's death has intensified public anger. In response to the unrest, police have deployed tear gas and water cannons, while President Prabowo Subianto has issued an apology and seven officers have been cited for ethics violations. The events are considered a significant test for the new president as public frustration over economic hardships continues to grow across the nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing abortions, even in cases of sexual assault and incest. The draft rule would also forbid VA providers from counseling veterans about pregnancy termination, with a narrow exception only for situations where the mother's life is directly endangered. This proposal reverses a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The move has drawn sharp criticism from abortion rights advocates and female veterans, who argue it will endanger women's lives, particularly given the high rates of sexual assault and intimate partner violence experienced by service members.</p>

Despite this, there is encouragement that Palace is preparing for his departure by actively seeking replacements, including Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and Manchester City's Manuel Akanji. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a sale likely to prevent him from leaving on a free transfer next summer.</p>

          <h2>Trump Utilizes Rare 'Pocket Rescission' to Block $4.9 Billion in Foreign Aid</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has informed Congress that he will not spend $4.9 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved, employing a rare executive maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." By submitting the request to cancel the funds late in the fiscal year, the 45-day window for congressional action will expire, causing the funding for the State Department and USAID to lapse. This tactic, last used nearly 50 years ago, effectively allows the president to make budget cuts without legislative approval. The move aligns with the administration's policy of reducing foreign aid but raises constitutional questions about the separation of powers and congressional control over spending.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a proposed regulation to tighten visa rules for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. The new rule would replace the current "duration of status" system with fixed time periods, generally no longer than four years for students (F-visas) and exchange visitors (J-visas), and up to 240 days for journalists (I-visas). The administration stated the change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight of visa holders. This move is part of a broader crackdown on legal immigration and would require these individuals to apply for extensions to continue their stay, creating new hurdles for those studying or working in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez has drawn rare bipartisan condemnation from Congress and triggered a staff walkout at the agency's headquarters. Monarez was reportedly dismissed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for refusing to remove other officials and for her commitment to proven vaccines. The turmoil, which includes the resignation of four other top CDC leaders, has raised alarms about political interference in science and public health. Republican senators like Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have expressed deep concern, calling the removal baseless and warning against attacks on the scientific process.</p>

          <p>The White House's AI Action Plan, which promotes deregulation and bans diversity-focused initiatives, could have severe consequences for health care by encoding biases into medical technology. The article argues that by slashing funding for research on marginalized communities and pressuring government agencies to use data conforming to political ideology, the administration is creating a flawed foundation for AI development. This could lead to AI tools that perpetuate and automate existing health disparities, similar to how past clinical tools have harmed minority patients by using race-based corrections. The rapid, large-scale integration of these biased systems risks cementing current inequities into the future standards of medical care.</p>

England coach Thomas Tuchel cited a need for a "tighter, more competitive squad" and has previously expressed reservations about Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities. This international setback compounds a difficult start in La Liga, where he was substituted early in his debut and benched for the following match. The situation presents a daunting period for the 26-year-old, whose future roles for both his club and country now appear uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, which had been authorized by Joe Biden before he left office. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, Biden had quietly extended Harris's detail for an additional year. A memo dated Thursday directs the Secret Service to discontinue this non-mandated security effective September 1. The move, which follows the revocation of protection for other former officials and political rivals, has been criticized by some as an act of political retaliation that could put Harris in danger as she embarks on a national book tour.</p>

Amid the chaos, accounts have emerged of older children and adults shielding younger students from harm.

While deliveries abroad grew by almost 145% year-over-year, the fierce competition at home significantly impacted the company's bottom line. The results highlight the challenging conditions within China's EV market, even for its dominant player, as manufacturers battle for market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent data shows that the median price for condominiums in the U.S. has decreased by 2.1% over the past year, while single-family home prices have risen. This price drop is largely attributed to an oversupply of condos, particularly in markets like Florida and Texas. However, the article cautions that a lower sale price doesn't necessarily mean a bargain for buyers. Rising costs for HOA dues, insurance premiums, and new building reserve requirements can quickly offset the initial savings. Real estate agents advise prospective buyers to look beyond the sticker price and carefully analyze a building's financials to understand the true long-term cost of ownership.

The 23-year-old, nicknamed the "two-meter Messi-Musiala" for his combination of size and skill, has seen his stock rise dramatically after a successful season in the Bundesliga and a strong performance in the U21 European Championship. The move is a notable miss for Bayern Munich, which had two bids for the player rejected.
