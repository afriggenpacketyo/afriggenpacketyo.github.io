          <p>The Trump administration deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrations, which began Friday evening, escalated over the weekend, leading to traffic disruptions on the 101 Freeway and police declaring an unlawful assembly. President Trump cited "lawlessness" in California as justification for deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and threatened legal action, arguing the federal government was attempting to seize control of the California National Guard. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between the state and federal government regarding immigration policy and enforcement. Optimism surrounding the resolution of the conflict is low.</p>

          <p>Oakmont Country Club's notoriously fast greens, deep rough, and penal bunkers make it one of golf's toughest courses, as noted by legendary golfers. The course's difficulty inspired the invention of the Stimpmeter to measure green speed, and golfers have long commented on its challenging layout. Built in the early 20th century, Oakmont was designed to severely penalize poor shots. The course has been modified over time, now measuring 7,431 yards with a par of 71, and it has hosted several US Opens, with winning scores often over par. This year's tournament is expected to provide a formidable challenge for the world's best golfers.</p>

          <p>Robinhood shares experienced a nearly 5% drop in premarket trading after the online brokerage was not included in the latest S&P 500 Index rebalance. This news came after speculation that Robinhood would earn a spot in the benchmark, fueled by a recent rally that doubled its share price this year. Inclusion in the S&P 500 typically leads to increased trading volume and passive fund investment, as seen with Coinbase's stock surge after its inclusion. Despite the setback, Robinhood has seen a significant comeback this year, recovering from a period of disfavor following the GameStop trading mania and the collapse of FTX.

          <p>A woman shared her frustrations on Reddit about being the sole cook in her household and the criticism she receives from her husband regarding meal variety. She described a system of repeating 10 dishes to ease the mental burden of cooking for her family, which includes her husband, daughter, and younger brother. The conflict arose when her husband requested fancier meals with more meat, but then objected to the cost of the necessary ingredients. Commenters on Reddit largely supported the woman, suggesting she stop cooking for her husband and allow him to fend for himself.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a climate solution to combat rising temperatures: planting more trees, especially in urban heat islands. These areas, often lower-income neighborhoods, experience higher temperatures due to lack of shade and older homes. Research indicates that trees can significantly lower temperatures, and the city aims to plant 2,000 trees annually to reach a goal of 60,000 by 2050. The effort involves selecting drought-tolerant, shade-providing trees and educating the next generation through school garden clubs, all to mitigate the effects of climate change and improve community well-being.</p>

          <p>A major Sikh temple in the US is calling for a Department of Justice investigation into the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it operates as a "foreign agent" for the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Fremont Gurdwara Sahib claims the HAF has facilitated meetings between foreign officials and US lawmakers and advocated for the interests of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and non-partisan status. These allegations emerge amid heightened tensions between Sikhs supporting an independent state and the Indian government, particularly following accusations of transnational repression against Sikhs outside of India.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in Congress could significantly impact low-income families by overhauling student loan programs and Pell Grant eligibility. The legislation would increase the required course credits for maximum Pell Grant eligibility and eliminate subsidized loans, potentially raising the cost of college for many students. It also imposes lifetime borrowing caps that don't account for varying costs across institutions, potentially affecting professional programs like medical school. Critics argue these changes would make college less accessible and could exacerbate existing societal problems, such as the doctor shortage. (not investment advice)</p>

David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, with Gunnar Wiedenfels heading the global networks business.

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is urging the European Union to implement "better and simpler regulation" to improve its capital markets. In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM argues that European markets have fallen behind in dynamism and investment opportunities compared to other regions. A key recommendation is the creation of a single security market regulator at the European level to address fragmentation, legal uncertainty, and inconsistent interpretations. NBIM manages Norway's oil and gas revenues and held 285 billion euros in EU securities at the end of 2024. (not investment advice)</p>
