          <p>India launched missile strikes, dubbed Operation Sindoor, targeting nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming these were bases for terrorist activities against India. This action follows a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in the deaths of 26 people last month, which India has blamed on Pakistan. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes and vowed a forceful response, while President Trump expressed hope for a swift end to the conflict. The escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations have prompted international concern and calls for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings and provided a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter. However, the company anticipates a $1.5 billion hit to revenue throughout the fiscal year due to new U.S. regulations restricting the export of advanced AI chips to China. Despite these challenges, AMD CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, citing powerful tailwinds from the company's leadership product portfolio, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. AMD's chips are being used to train AI, and a major AI model developer is using AMD chips to deploy their service, a process called inference.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer (SMCI) released weaker-than-anticipated guidance, citing economic uncertainty and the potential impact of President Trump's new tariffs on imported goods. The company's fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations, and its fourth-quarter outlook also disappointed analysts. CEO Charles Liang attributed the underperformance to customers delaying commitments while evaluating AI platforms. The company is refraining from providing fiscal 2026 guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The article notes Super Micro's recent history, including a short seller report and auditor resignation, but also its efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq filing requirements.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the ethical and legal issues surrounding Donald Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures. Experts like Eswar Prasad and Lawrence Lessig argue that Trump's promotion of meme coins and stablecoins, such as $Trump and USD1, while in office, creates conflicts of interest and potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clauses. The article details instances where Trump's actions have directly benefited his crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, and raised concerns about bribery and corruption. Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed concerns, while some crypto executives worry that Trump's involvement could harm the industry's reputation.</p>

          <p>During a meeting between President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, tensions simmered beneath the surface as both leaders sought to maintain a cordial facade. Trump reiterated his suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state, to which Carney firmly responded that Canada is not for sale. The two leaders also clashed on trade, with Trump indicating he would not lift tariffs on Canada. Carney emphasized the importance of the long-term partnership between the two countries and vowed to defend Canada's interests during upcoming trade negotiations. Carney's strategy was described as “elbows up,” a hockey term for offering a stiff defense.</p>

The decision was announced during a staff meeting where managers stated that divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated.

          <p>Starting May 7th, the U.S. government will require travelers to present a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints. This change aims to enhance security by setting a more consistent standard for state-issued documentation. Real IDs are marked with a star, but enhanced driver's licenses, offered in a few states, also comply. While a Real ID is sufficient for domestic flights, a passport is still needed for international travel.

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under President Trump is pulling back from enforcing a rule that classified Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) providers as credit card issuers. This decision rolls back consumer protections established during Joe Biden's presidency, including standardized disclosures and formal dispute investigations. The CFPB is considering rescinding the rule entirely, citing a need to focus resources on pressing threats to consumers. The move follows opposition from BNPL firms and a lawsuit from the Financial Technology Association.</p>

Since about 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, consumers can expect to pay more. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers, and some are trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs.</p>
