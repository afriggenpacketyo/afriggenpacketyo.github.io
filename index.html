          <p>Restaurant Brands International announced mixed financial results for its second quarter. While the company's overall net income declined compared to the previous year, this was partially offset by strong performance from its Tim Hortons brand and robust international demand. The Popeyes chain experienced a notable decline in same-store sales, contributing to the profit decrease. Despite beating revenue expectations, the company's adjusted earnings per share fell short of Wall Street forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing intense criticism and calls to resign over allegations she significantly increased the rent on a house she owns. The rent hike reportedly occurred just weeks after the previous tenants' contract ended, a move that critics, including the Conservative Party chairman, have labeled as "staggering hypocrisy." While a spokesperson for Ali stated that all legal requirements were met, the controversy has intensified the debate around renters' rights and the conduct of public officials.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet is scheduled to discuss the potential expansion of the war in Gaza, including a full military occupation and the resettlement of the enclave. The article highlights a growing debate within Israel, where calls to re-establish Jewish communities in Gaza, once a fringe idea, are now entering mainstream political discourse. It presents a spectrum of opinions from Israeli officials, ranging from those who see resettlement as a necessary security measure to former military leaders who warn it would be a strategic mistake.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated late-stage trial, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% weight loss over 72 weeks. While slightly below the most optimistic Wall Street expectations, the results are considered strong and pave the way for a needle-free alternative in the booming GLP-1 drug market. The pill's convenience could significantly expand patient access, though some doctors noted discontinuation rates due to gastrointestinal side effects were higher than with existing injectables.</p>

          <p>A review of David M. Lubin's new book, "Ready for My Close-Up," delves into the history and legacy of the classic 1950 film "Sunset Boulevard." The book examines the movie's savage critique of Hollywood, its blend of dark themes with sparkling wit, and the anxieties of its creators, director Billy Wilder and star Gloria Swanson. The review notes the film's enduring relevance and its apparent fascination for figures like Donald Trump, who frequently screens the movie about a faded star obsessed with a comeback.</p>

          <p>Newly released data from Homeland Security shows that arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles region dropped significantly in July compared to the previous month. This decline follows a federal court order that blocked agents from targeting people without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally. While the 1,371 arrests in July are still higher than pre-operation averages, the figure represents a notable decrease from the nearly 2,800 arrests made in the month prior.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are advancing a bill, AB 554, designed to protect access to crucial HIV prevention medications like PrEP and PEP. The legislation would mandate that state-regulated health plans and insurers cover these FDA-approved drugs without requiring prior authorization or patient cost-sharing. This move is seen by advocates as a necessary shield against potential threats at the federal level, where concerns have been raised about the current administration's stance on preventive healthcare and the future of related federal task forces.</p>

          <p>This satirical column adopts the perspective of a character who is convinced that every personal setback is the result of a rigged system or a grand conspiracy. The narrator humorously blames external forces for everything from a high number on the bathroom scale to poor book sales on Amazon, all while firing his staff and suing his advisors. The piece serves as a parody of a modern political mindset where personal responsibility is replaced by the belief that powerful, unseen enemies are manipulating all outcomes.</p>

          <p>A new federal law mandating work requirements for Medicaid recipients is projected to have a massive impact in California, potentially causing up to 3.4 million people to lose their Medi-Cal coverage. State health officials and health plan leaders warn that the "labyrinth of manual verification," which requires recipients to prove they are working or volunteering every six months, will create significant bureaucratic hurdles. Critics argue this will lead to eligible individuals losing insurance, while supporters claim it will encourage work.</p>
