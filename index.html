          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with President Trump's domestic agenda, aiming to pass a sweeping bill that includes tax cuts, Medicaid reductions, and changes to food assistance programs. The legislation, dubbed the "big beautiful bill," faces opposition from Democrats and dissent within Republican ranks, particularly over Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deduction limits. Conservative lawmakers argue the Medicaid cuts don't go far enough, while Republicans from high-tax states are dissatisfied with the proposed state and local tax deduction limit. The plan's fate in the Senate is also uncertain, with several senators expressing concerns about its fiscal responsibility and impact on healthcare. </p>

          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's announcement that those on baseball's ineligible list would be removed upon death, Pete Rose's daughter, Fawn, shared her emotional reaction to her father's potential Hall of Fame eligibility. The announcement came just before Cincinnati Reds hosted Pete Rose Night, celebrating the late baseball legend. Fawn praised the commissioner for his kindness and understanding during discussions about her father, highlighting the overwhelming love and gratitude from Cincinnati fans. Rose, who admitted to gambling, had been banned from baseball, making him ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration until now. </p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the sinking of the Bayesian superyacht off Sicily, which resulted in seven deaths, indicates that the vessel was likely capsized by a strong gust of wind due to its unusually tall mast. The report from British maritime authorities reveals that a deckhand delayed waking the captain and instead posted a video of the approaching storm on social media. The yacht's single mast, one of the tallest in the world, increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds, according to the report. Outside experts also questioned the boat's overall stability, pointing to the high center of gravity due to the tall mast. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a $20 million cut in funding for California newsrooms, reducing the state's contribution to a joint initiative with Google to support local journalism. The decision, which slashes funding by 67%, is attributed to a $12 billion budget shortfall facing the state. The original plan, modeled after a Canadian bill, aimed to provide financial aid to struggling newspapers based on the number of journalists they employ. Newsom's revised budget also includes reductions in healthcare for low-income undocumented immigrants and decreased overtime for some government employees. </p>

          <p>A $500 million luxury hotel project planned by the Trump family in Serbia is facing complications after a Serbian official admitted to forging a document that allowed the demolition of a protected site for the project. The project, led by Jared Kushner, aims to build a complex including a Trump International Hotel on the site of a former Defense Ministry building. The forged document was used to justify stripping the site of its cultural heritage status, leading to charges of abuse of office and forgery against the official. The project has faced protests and criticism in Serbia, with opposition leaders alleging special treatment for the Trump and Kushner families. </p>

          <p>China Vanke, a debt-laden property developer, has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from its largest shareholder, state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group, to help meet its debt obligations. The loan, with a 36-month term and a low interest rate, aims to cover interest and principal repayments. This financial support follows a government-led shake-up in February, where authorities tightened control over Vanke by appointing new executives. Despite this assistance, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory, reflecting ongoing concerns in the financial markets. </p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown academic, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested on March 17 by immigration agents, accused of "spreading Hamas propaganda" and having "connections to a known or suspected terrorist." The judge refuted the government's claims, stating there was no evidence of Suri supporting Hamas. While the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri, his release comes amid concerns about the targeting of students and academics for their support of Palestinian rights. </p>

          <p>China-Philippine relations are facing a potential shift as President Marcos' allies failed to secure a majority in the midterm elections, potentially strengthening the position of Vice-President Duterte. Duterte, accused of misusing public funds, may avoid impeachment and remain eligible for the 2028 presidential race, where her "pragmatic" stance on China could lead to improved relations. Preliminary election results indicate that Marcos' aligned candidates secured fewer Senate seats than expected, while Duterte's allies gained ground.

          <p>The Trump administration's strained relationship with South Africa is influenced by several factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists, disagreements over Israel's war in Gaza, and a focus on eliminating diversity and inclusion programs. The administration has halted foreign aid to South Africa, citing "race-based discrimination," and has begun welcoming white South African refugees while suspending the refugee program for others. This decision stems from Mr. Trump's belief that white Afrikaners are a persecuted minority, influenced by conversations with figures like golfer Gary Player and Fox News coverage. The situation has led to the expulsion of South Africa's ambassador and accusations of white victimhood driving U.S. policy. </p>

          <p>Following President Trump's offer to resettle white Afrikaners in the US, a debate has emerged in South Africa regarding the status of Afrikaners and whether they should leave the country. While some, like Ulrich Janse van Vuuren, express pride in their South African identity and a commitment to contributing to the nation's success, others, such as Ilse Steenkamp, feel persecuted and have applied for the US refugee program. Trump's offer stems from claims of persecution and a "genocide" against white Afrikaners, claims widely discredited. Despite these claims, the majority of Afrikaners remain in South Africa, with prominent lobby groups reiterating their intention to stay and work towards a better future for all. </p>

Some MAGA figures view the deal as a betrayal of Trump's "America First" policy and a sign of corruption.

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a plan to transform the Third Street Promenade into an entertainment zone by allowing public drinking. The initiative aims to revitalize the commercial district, which has experienced declining foot traffic since the pandemic. The "Entertainment Zone" will operate on weekends, permitting visitors to purchase alcoholic beverages from participating businesses and consume them outdoors. While supporters believe the proposal will boost foot traffic and support local businesses, some residents have expressed concerns about potential increases in crime and homelessness. </p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking a positive turn in the fight against the opioid crisis. However, the progress comes as the Trump administration is proposing cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. While the CDC has praised President Trump's efforts, experts worry that the proposed funding cuts could undermine the gains made. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, and the long-term sustainability of the progress is uncertain. </p>
