          <p>The Guardian reports that a federal appeals court has blocked a plan to reinstate more than 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) workers after an earlier court ruling granted a temporary stay on Donald Trump’s executive order dismantling the US taxpayer-funded news service. The ruling effectively means that the courts must defer to the executive branch on employment matters. Judge Nina Pillard dissented, stating that the decision was tantamount to “silencing Voice of America for the foreseeable future”.</p>

          <p>Sir John Curtice of the BBC analyzes the Reform Party's performance in recent local council elections, noting that their triumph reflects more than just a protest vote. The party secured the most votes and seats, gaining control of numerous councils. The analysis reveals that Reform's success is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019. The party's appeal is stronger in working-class areas and places with fewer university graduates, indicating a distinctive demographic base.</p>
