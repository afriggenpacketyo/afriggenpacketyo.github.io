          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey reveals in his new book, "Poems & Prayers," that a key to his long-lasting marriage with Camila Alves is sleeping in a queen-size bed instead of a king. He argues that the larger bed creates too much physical distance between a couple, whereas a smaller one encourages closeness and intimacy. McConaughey emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the marital relationship, noting that demonstrating a healthy partnership serves as a powerful example for their children. The actor believes this simple change has been genuinely beneficial for his 13-year marriage.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the political motivations of Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dismantling the initial narrative that the shooter was a far-right extremist. Charging documents reveal Robinson's mother described him as leaning more to the left and being pro-trans rights, and that he confessed he had "enough of his hatred." The piece critiques the tribalistic impulse on both sides of the political spectrum to embrace comforting but false narratives. It argues that for progressives to credibly occupy the "reality-based community," they must rigorously challenge their own biases and assumptions.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang explores the divergent paths of the U.S. and China by contrasting their leadership styles, characterizing America as a "lawyerly society" and China as an "engineering state." Wang posits that while China's engineer-led focus on infrastructure and manufacturing has produced remarkable physical dynamism, it has often come at the expense of individual happiness and service-sector jobs. He argues that the U.S. could learn from China's ability to execute large-scale projects but warns against adopting its authoritarian tendencies. The book challenges both nations to learn from each other's successes and failures to avoid self-defeating competition.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major aviation technology provider, has caused widespread disruptions at several key European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's Muse software, which manages check-in and baggage systems for multiple airlines, forced airports to revert to manual processing. This led to extensive queues, flight delays, and cancellations, with passengers reporting hours-long waits and missed connections. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected global aviation industry to digital threats and the cascading effects a single system failure can have on travel.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The Russian aircraft, which had their transponders off and no flight plan, were intercepted by Finnish and Italian jets under a NATO mission. This incident is the latest in a series of Russian provocations against NATO's eastern flank, prompting calls for a more robust and unified response from the alliance.

His tenure is celebrated not just for his individual accolades, including three Cy Young awards, but for being the cornerstone of the franchise's revival from a period of turmoil and bankruptcy. When Kershaw debuted in 2008, the Dodgers had not won a postseason series in 20 years; his consistent excellence guided the team through its darkest times into an era of sustained success.

The article also highlights Tesla's volatile sales across Europe and showcases new developments like Audi's concept roadster.

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has intensified its rhetoric against "leftwing" groups, leading immigrant advocacy organizations to prepare for a potential federal crackdown. Top aides like Stephen Miller have vowed to hold nonprofits "criminally liable" for what they baselessly describe as coordinated attacks on ICE agents. In response, activists are exercising caution while continuing their work of observing raids and providing legal aid, asserting their First Amendment rights. The threats are seen as part of a broader effort to create an atmosphere of fear and curtail speech and organizing within immigrant communities.</p>

In the days following the shooting, President Trump and his allies have escalated threats against the "radical left," considering classifications of some groups as domestic terrorists despite no evidence linking them to the crime. Critics warn this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a violent event as a pretext to crush dissent, erode free speech, and delegitimize the Democratic party.

          <p>South African police have dismantled a major crystal methamphetamine laboratory on a farm in Volksrust, seizing drugs with an estimated street value of $20 million. During the raid, authorities arrested five individuals from a North American country and the farm's caretaker, while two other suspects believed to be from West African nations managed to escape. The discovery of industrial-scale equipment highlights South Africa's role as both a major consumer market and a key transit point for illicit drugs. This operation marks a significant blow to organized crime in the region.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad dictatorship, but the process is indirect and fraught with controversy. Instead of a public vote, members of a new 121-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by an "electoral college" of 6,000 to 7,000 individuals appointed by district sub-committees. Critics, particularly minority groups, have called the process a "charade" designed to legitimize the transitional government. A major point of contention is that the interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, will directly appoint an additional 70 parliamentarians, giving him significant control over the new legislative body.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is implementing a significant policy change that will require journalists to sign a pledge agreeing not to gather any information, including unclassified material, unless it has been officially authorized for release. According to U.S. officials, reporters who violate this new rule will have their press credentials revoked. This move will severely restrict media access to the Department of Defense headquarters. The policy raises serious concerns among press freedom advocates about government transparency and the ability of journalists to conduct independent oversight of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee on companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, set to take effect on September 21. The administration cited a need to prevent "abuse" of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers. The move has drawn criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue the exorbitant fee will price out small and medium-sized businesses and harm U.S. competitiveness by hindering the ability to attract top global talent. Major tech companies, the largest users of the program, are now re-evaluating their staffing strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk is scheduled for Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance among the speakers. Kirk, a prominent and influential figure in the conservative movement, was fatally shot on September 10 during a university tour stop in Utah. The event, which is expected to draw tens of thousands, has been designated a high-security event by the Department of Homeland Security. Following Kirk's death, the White House has intensified its rhetoric against political opponents, prompting criticism from Democrats about threats to free speech.</p>

Simultaneously, the climate activist group "Fridays for Future" has called for rallies in 70 cities to demand an end to fossil fuel use. The climate protests are fueled by recent government announcements to build new gas-fired power plants, which activists argue undermines Germany's climate goals.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's new book, "Smitten," explores the science behind "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by obsessive thoughts and emotional highs and lows. Bellamy explains that while limerence is a natural part of early love, it can become an unhealthy addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or sends mixed signals, driving the brain's reward system into a state of craving. He offers strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, reframing positive daydreams into negative "daymares," and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the obsession.</p>

In response, a new volunteer initiative, Project Franklin, is pairing cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON hacker community with under-resourced rural water operators. The program aims to bolster defenses against sophisticated threats, like the Chinese group Volt Typhoon, which seeks to pre-position malware for potential future conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Turkish government is increasingly targeting female artists, with the girl band Manifest being the latest to face a criminal investigation for "indecent and immoral acts" following a concert. This action is part of a broader pattern where popular female musicians and writers have been arrested or subjected to smear campaigns for allegedly violating moral or religious values. Feminist historian Berrin Sonmez argues this is a political strategy by the ruling AKP party to consolidate power by using the religious authority Diyanet to promote a conservative agenda, thereby oppressing women and silencing dissent under the guise of protecting societal values.</p>

          <p>While Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's playful stunts have successfully garnered media attention and contributed to electoral gains, the party now faces the challenge of defining its substantive political identity. Polling suggests that many voters, including Lib Dem supporters, view the antics as making the party look less serious and are unclear about its core policies. As the party gathers for its conference, the key question is how to translate its increased parliamentary presence into a broader appeal. The party aims to capture centrist voters alienated by the Conservatives and Reform UK by focusing on patriotism and values, but it must still develop a compelling economic message.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing increasing diplomatic pressure as key allies like France, Canada, and the UK move toward recognizing Palestine as a state at the United Nations. The German government, however, maintains it will not take this step in the short term, stating that recognition must be the final outcome of a peace process that results in a two-state solution. This position creates a dilemma for Berlin, which balances its historical responsibility for Israel's security—its "reason of state"—with growing criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza and pressure from EU partners and a majority of the German public who favor recognition.</p>

A Palestinian bank worker described losing his mortgaged apartment in a tower that was destroyed after a brief evacuation warning. The UN Human Rights Office has stated that a deliberate effort to relocate the population could amount to ethnic cleansing. Israel's military maintains that the demolished buildings are used by Hamas for military purposes and that warnings are issued to civilians, though the widespread destruction exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis.</p>
