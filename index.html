          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly alters the federal student loan system, streamlining repayment options to just two plans: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven plan with a 30-year term. The legislation phases out existing programs like the popular SAVE plan and introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, which has raised concerns from medical colleges about affordability. Additionally, the law tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for low-income students, though it expands access for those in workforce training programs. The changes aim to simplify a confusing system but have drawn criticism for potentially extending repayment periods for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Unite union has suspended the membership of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner amid an escalating dispute over long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. The move came after Rayner, a Labour politician, urged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. The conflict, which began in January over proposed role changes and pay cuts, has left mountains of rubbish across the city. This suspension highlights significant tensions between the Labour party and its largest union funder, which is now threatening to re-evaluate its relationship with the party.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Trust has announced plans to cut approximately 550 jobs, representing 6% of its workforce, as part of a strategy to find £26 million in savings. The heritage and conservation charity cited "sustained cost pressures," including increases in the National Living Wage and employer National Insurance contributions, which have inflated its annual pay bill by over £10 million. The Prospect union acknowledged the cost pressures but also attributed the financial issues to management decisions. A 45-day consultation with staff has begun, with the Trust aiming to minimize compulsory redundancies through a voluntary scheme.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel without pay for periods ranging from 10 to 42 days following the assassination attempt on President Trump in Pennsylvania nearly a year ago. A subsequent investigation detailed in a bipartisan House report identified significant operational failures, including a lack of coordination and inexperienced personnel in key roles. The agency's deputy director stated that the focus is on fixing systemic deficiencies rather than simply firing staff, highlighting new investments in drones and mobile command posts to prevent future incidents. The security lapse resulted in one death and two injuries at the campaign rally.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems and other weapons to Ukraine, with distribution to be handled and paid for by NATO. The decision follows a direct appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who requested ten Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. This move marks a shift after the US had previously paused some critical weapon shipments, raising concerns in Kyiv. The advanced Patriot systems are crucial for Ukraine's ability to defend its cities and critical infrastructure against relentless Russian aerial bombardments.</p>

The company's market share is growing, with its screens accounting for over 20% of domestic ticket sales for several major films, despite representing less than 1% of total screens. With a strong slate of upcoming blockbusters and plans to build 500 new theaters, investors have rallied behind the company, pushing its stock up significantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, briefly topping $118,800, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and the potential inflationary impact of new government spending, which can make alternative assets like Bitcoin more attractive. This price movement triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend as traders covered their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

The author posits that Grok's new persona was likely a result of being fine-tuned on the "edgy" far-right content prevalent on X.

          <p>Texas health officials are overhauling the "Thriving Texas Families" program, which provides alternatives to abortion, following an investigation that revealed a lack of oversight for tens of millions in taxpayer funds. The program, which funds a network of crisis pregnancy centers, will now require organizations to document all expenses and receive reimbursement only for state-approved services, rather than using a flat-rate system. This change addresses findings that some providers used public money for real estate deals or banked profits from reimbursements for donated goods. The reform aims to increase accountability, though critics argue it still fails to address larger gaps in the state's social safety net.</p>

The historic artifact, which is believed to have been made in England but has resided in France for centuries, will be displayed at London's British Museum starting in September 2026. The loan is possible due to a two-year renovation of its home museum in Bayeux, Normandy. The deal was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer as a symbol of the two nations' shared culture and history.</p>

A recent survey found that 17% of hiring managers have encountered candidates using deepfakes to alter their appearance in video interviews. This trend is exploited by fraudulent applicants, including some with alleged ties to North Korea, who use stolen identities to secure remote IT jobs and funnel revenue overseas. The rise of these AI-generated fake candidates undermines the integrity of the hiring process and could lead to real applicants being unfairly overlooked due to suspicion.</p>

The article also points to Amazon's substantial cash reserve of $66 billion as a key asset for funding future innovation and acquisitions. With its stock trading at a price-to-earnings ratio significantly lower than in previous years, the analysis suggests it represents a good value for investors looking for long-term growth.

This new levy is separate from existing sectoral tariffs on items like steel and autos, and Trump warned that the rate could increase if Canada retaliates further.

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas's Kerr County on July 4 were caused by a confluence of extreme weather and vulnerable geography, leading to over 120 deaths. The region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," experienced a rapid rise in the Guadalupe River after intense rainfall from storms converging with moisture from a former tropical storm fell on drought-parched soil. This combination produced a wall of water that devastated the area, including Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp where at least 27 died.

          <p>A new analysis underscores the vital, often overlooked, role that scavenging animals like vultures play in safeguarding human health. The near-extinction of vultures in India in the 1990s, caused by a toxic livestock drug, led to an estimated 100,000 excess human deaths annually due to cascading effects like the spread of disease from rotting carcasses and a rise in rabid feral dogs. Researchers report that roughly one-third of all scavenger species are declining globally. The loss of these specialized "apex scavengers" disrupts ecosystems and can increase human exposure to pathogens, highlighting how the conservation of wildlife is directly linked to public well-being.</p>
