        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has defended its new export controls on rare earths as a "legitimate" measure under international law, countering US accusations of economic coercion. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated these controls, which also cover related intellectual property and technologies, aim to strengthen its export control system and safeguard global stability. This move comes ahead of a potential meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with Trump having announced retaliatory 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and export controls on critical software, causing significant market value drops. Beijing accused the US of "double standards" regarding trade restrictions, emphasizing its readiness to protect its interests.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv, expressing hope for the imminent release of hostages by Hamas as a ceasefire deal nears its deadline. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowd, crediting Donald Trump for facilitating the agreement, though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced boos. Concurrently, Palestinian officials reported that approximately 500,000 people have returned to northern Gaza, now in ruins, following the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Egypt is set to host a summit with over 20 leaders, including Trump, to finalize an agreement aimed at ending the war, while Hamas mobilizes fighters in Gaza amidst fears of internal violence.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a move anticipated to reduce annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. This decision, announced by Kenyan Treasury Minister John Mbadi, is seen by analysts as a potential precedent for other debt-stressed African nations, possibly drawing them closer to China. The loans, initially from the Export-Import Bank of China, financed the Standard Gauge Railway. While the new yuan loan terms, including interest rates, were not fully disclosed, Mbadi previously indicated a halving of rates from the existing 6.37% under the dollar agreement.

          <p>Prince Andrew's reputation has suffered another blow after newspaper reports revealed an email suggesting continued contact with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in February 2011, contradicting his earlier claims of cutting ties. The intimate tone of the alleged email, stating "we are in this together," further undermines his attempts to distance himself. This latest scandal intensifies calls for King Charles and the Royal Family to impose sanctions, such as removing his Duke of York title or his residence at Royal Lodge. Despite previous attempts by the King to reduce Andrew's status, like cutting funding, his financial resilience and independent lease make his removal challenging, prompting ongoing debate about parliamentary intervention to strip his titles.</p>

He points to a "failure of leadership" regarding broken hydrants, a non-functional reservoir, and inadequate fire department response during the inferno.

Despite global energy investment projected to reach US$3.3 trillion this year, with clean technologies attracting double the fossil fuel investment, a crisis of confidence is emerging. The piece highlights over US$22 billion in cancelled or scaled-back clean energy projects in the US, resulting in 16,500 job losses, due to regulatory uncertainty and populist-driven erosion of political will. It contends that the greatest threat to net-zero ambitions is the dismantling of policy frameworks, as populist leaders exploit the disconnect between immediate costs and deferred climate benefits.

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and the return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, which has occurred for over a century, grants most people an extra hour. The change will happen at 02:00 BST on Sunday, October 26, 2025. While the nights are already drawing in, this change will abruptly bring sunset forward by an hour. Debates persist about making BST permanent, with arguments for economic boosts and reduced road accidents, but concerns remain about dark winter mornings, especially in Scotland.</p>

          <p>The future of 30 beluga whales at Canada's Marineland is in doubt after the federal government denied a permit to sell them to a Chinese theme park. Marineland, facing financial struggles and a history of animal mistreatment, has threatened euthanasia if a new home or funding isn't secured, a claim dismissed by former employees as bluster. Canada's 2019 ban on whale captivity does not apply to existing animals, leaving few options. Advocates are calling for the provincial government to seize the whales and explore alternative solutions, such as a Nova Scotia sanctuary, though it won't be ready until next summer and can only house a fraction of the animals.</p>

          <p>Several women are confronting tech giant Meta (Facebook and Instagram) over persistently receiving targeted pregnancy-related advertisements after experiencing miscarriages or stillbirths. Sammi Claxon and Rhiannon Lawson shared their distressing experiences of being "bombarded" with ads that served as painful reminders of their losses. Tanya O'Carroll successfully sued Facebook to stop targeted ads based on her personal data, becoming the sole UK user exempted, while Meta is introducing a 'consent or pay' subscription model for ad-free use. Former Meta employee Arturo Bejar claims the company's 'mark as spam' feature was ineffective, accusing Meta of prioritizing user engagement for profit over user safety and well-being.</p>

Owen's documentary explored Cardiff University's anatomy center, where donated bodies are used for education, revealing the profound connection students develop with their 'silent teachers.' The article highlights the declining rates of body donation in the UK and the long wait families endure for funerals, but emphasizes the immense importance and positive impact of such donations on medical education.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the nation's primary mental health agency, as the government shutdown continues. These cuts are part of a broader "reduction in force" across federal agencies, significantly reducing SAMHSA's workforce which oversees critical programs like the 988 suicide prevention hotline and billions in mental health grants. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the layoffs, attributing them to the "Democrat-led government shutdown." Critics argue these cuts severely weaken America's public health capacity, aligning with President Trump's long-held goal of reducing the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a surge in common respiratory illnesses, including colds, flu, and COVID-19, leading to widespread sickness. Experts attribute this to the autumn season, with increased indoor mixing as children return to school and adults to work, creating ideal conditions for viruses to spread. While Rhinovirus (common cold) is currently the most prevalent, new COVID variants are circulating, and flu cases are showing an early uptick, particularly in younger age groups. Public health officials note that current illness levels are not unusually high compared to pre-pandemic trends, emphasizing the importance of vaccinations for eligible individuals and basic hygiene practices to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

The film, which features a Kpop girl trio battling demon boy bands, has become Netflix's most-watched title, surpassing 'Squid Game' with over 325 million views. Its soundtrack also made history with four songs simultaneously in the US top 10, including the chart-topping anthem 'Golden.' With critical acclaim and Oscar buzz for Best Animated Film and Original Song, Kang and co-director Chris Appelhans believe there are more stories to tell within this world, despite ruling out live-action adaptations due to the genre's unique comedic and tonal elements.</p>

          <p>Amid the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees due to "coding errors." This affected staff involved in critical public health responses, including Ebola and measles outbreaks, and those producing the weekly CDC science journal. While hundreds of HHS employees will still lose their jobs, a federal health official stated that mistakenly laid-off CDC workers would have their notices rescinded. These layoffs occurred as the US faces multiple public health threats, raising concerns about weakened national health capacity, particularly in disease surveillance and immunization efforts.</p>
