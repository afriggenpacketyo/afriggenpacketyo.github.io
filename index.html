          <p>Amazon is introducing prescription drug kiosks in its One Medical clinics across Los Angeles, allowing patients to receive common medications like antibiotics and inhalers almost immediately after their appointments. The initiative aims to improve patient convenience and medication adherence by eliminating the need for a separate trip to a pharmacy. Operated by Amazon Pharmacy, these machines are part of the company's broader strategy to expand its footprint in the healthcare industry and disrupt the traditional pharmacy model, which has seen major chains like Rite Aid and Walgreens struggle with declining profits and store closures. The service requires a remote pharmacist to verify each order before the medication is dispensed.</p>

          <p>Foreclosure filings in the United States have seen a steady increase, rising for six consecutive months and up 18% from the previous year, according to data from ATTOM. Homeowners are struggling with the escalating costs of home insurance, property taxes, and general living expenses, making it difficult to keep up with mortgage payments. The article highlights the personal story of a Kentucky resident who nearly lost her home, illustrating how unexpected life events, such as a loss of household income, can push financially-strained individuals into default. Experts note that rising homeownership costs and a slowing job market are key factors contributing to the surge. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from Indeed indicates that approximately 26% of jobs are susceptible to radical transformation due to generative artificial intelligence. White-collar professions in fields like technology and finance, which rely heavily on cognitive reasoning, are considered most at risk, while roles requiring physical labor or direct human interaction, such as nursing and construction, are more insulated. While some companies have already announced AI-driven layoffs, economists suggest the broader labor market has not yet seen a major disruption. The prevailing debate focuses on whether AI will automate jobs into obsolescence or augment human productivity, with most industries currently adopting a hybrid model where human oversight remains essential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell sharply following the European Union's announcement of plans to significantly hike steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The move, intended to protect the region's steel industry, has sparked alarm within the automotive sector, which fears higher input costs and inflationary pressure. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) criticized the proposal as excessive, stating that it threatens the industry's competitiveness. The market downturn was compounded by a profit warning from BMW, which cited slow growth in China and the impact of existing U.S. import tariffs as major challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey have concluded that their central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, would be problematic for their case, according to sources familiar with the matter. Richman reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously, directly undermining the indictment's core allegation that Comey lied to Congress. This development has led Justice Department officials to privately express concerns that the case, which alleges false statements and obstruction, could unravel. The indictment was pursued by a Trump-appointed prosecutor despite internal recommendations against moving forward due to insufficient evidence and potential statute of limitations issues.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders reacted to the team's decision to trade veteran Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals, a move that positions Sanders as the primary backup to starter Dillon Gabriel. Sanders expressed his gratitude for Flacco's mentorship, describing him as a source of wisdom who helped him significantly during his time in Cleveland. He mentioned that he was happy for Flacco and his new opportunity, noting the veteran's ability to adjust to any situation. The trade places more responsibility on Sanders and leaves Bailey Zappe as the remaining veteran presence in the quarterbacks' room, though he is currently on the practice squad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute reveals that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has increasingly issued warnings instead of meaningful penalties, like fines, to businesses violating the Animal Welfare Act. The report highlights cases of severe neglect at facilities like dog breeders and primate research labs where animals died, yet the violators faced no significant consequences. Critics argue that weak enforcement, exacerbated by understaffing and a recent Supreme Court decision limiting administrative fines, allows many businesses to treat penalties as a mere cost of operation. Animal advocates are pushing for legislative reforms to strengthen enforcement and deter future abuse of the limited number of animals covered by the act.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As overall mortgage application volume continues to decline, a growing number of homebuyers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the share of ARM applications recently increased to 9.5%, driven by a significant rate differential of nearly one percentage point below 30-year fixed rates. While ARMs offer immediate savings, they are considered riskier because their rates can increase after the initial fixed period, potentially leading to higher future payments. This trend reflects the ongoing affordability challenges in the housing market, where high prices and interest rates are pushing buyers to seek any available financial relief.

Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, accounting for over 90% of investor-owned homes.

          <p>Retirees aged 70½ and older can utilize a tax-efficient strategy known as qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) to make donations directly from their individual retirement accounts (IRAs). This move allows for a direct transfer of up to $108,000 annually to an eligible charity, with the distributed amount being excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI). By lowering their AGI, retirees can avoid higher Medicare premiums and satisfy their required minimum distributions (RMDs) without increasing their taxable income. Financial advisors describe QCDs as one of the most beneficial yet underutilized tax breaks, particularly for the 90% of filers who do not itemize deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior Russian diplomat has stated that the momentum for a peace agreement in Ukraine, which had been generated by the presidential summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Alaska, has now largely dissipated. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov commented that diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stalled since the August meeting failed to produce a breakthrough. In the time since, both Russia and Ukraine have continued to launch deadly strikes against each other, and Russia has reportedly made advances on the battlefield. The statement reflects a pessimistic outlook on the prospects for a near-term resolution to the three-and-a-half-year war.</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has killed at least 24 people and wounded 47 after a motorized paraglider dropped bombs on a crowd attending a Buddhist festival. The gathering, located in the Sagaing region, was organized as a peaceful protest against the ruling military junta's conscription policies and upcoming elections. This incident is part of an increasingly brutal campaign of airstrikes by the military, which has recently augmented its air power with new technology from China and Russia. The attack underscores the junta's violent suppression of dissent as it seeks to reclaim territory lost to resistance groups since the 2021 coup.</p>

          <p>The political crisis in France has intensified as prominent former allies of President Emmanuel Macron, including past prime ministers, have begun to publicly criticize his leadership. Gabriel Attal, who leads Macron's centrist group in parliament, stated he no longer understands the president's decisions, while former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe made a surprise call for an early presidential election to resolve the deadlock. The defections follow the resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu and highlight the growing instability within Macron's own political camp. This internal dissent marks a new, more perilous phase of the crisis, which originated from a hung parliament.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, now a Category 2 storm, is gradually weakening as it moves parallel to Mexico's Pacific coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Despite losing some strength, the hurricane continues to generate large, life-threatening swells, prompting a tropical storm watch for the southern portion of the Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm's center is expected to remain offshore, but coastal areas will experience dangerous surf, rip currents, and potential flooding. Priscilla's maximum sustained winds have decreased to 100 mph, and forecasters anticipate it will continue to weaken over the next 48 hours.</p>

          <p>A social media trend known as “locking in” has gained popularity among Gen Z, who are committing to periods of intense focus to achieve personal and financial goals. The practice, which often involves self-imposed challenges like limiting screen time and adopting healthy habits, is seen as a reaction against the constant distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties of the current era. While some view it as a rebranded form of millennial hustle culture, others see it as a coping mechanism for a generation navigating a competitive job market and the isolating effects of the pandemic.

Proponents from the center-right European People's Party argued that using these names for non-meat items is misleading to consumers and undermines Europe's culinary traditions. The decision has faced strong opposition from Green party members, consumer protection groups, and major supermarkets, who contend that such labels help consumers identify products and that a ban would stifle innovation. The final decision on whether the ban will be implemented now rests with the heads of state and governments of the EU member countries.</p>

Sectors like retail and hospitality are immediately affected by reduced consumer spending from furloughed federal workers. Furthermore, federal real estate activities, including new leases and property sales managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), are stalled, directly impacting companies that depend on government contracts.

Republicans argue that the issue can be addressed before the subsidies expire at the end of the year and should not be tied to reopening the government.

The article draws parallels to historical figures like Isaac Newton, suggesting their neurodivergence was integral to their genius.
