          <p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Elon Musk, labeling him "CRAZY" and suggesting the termination of government contracts with his companies due to Musk's opposition to Trump's tax bill. Musk retaliated by questioning Trump's election victory and hinting at the release of potentially damaging information related to Jeffrey Epstein. Musk even indicated support for Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vice President JD Vance. The escalating conflict between the two figures underscores a significant rift after their previous alliance. Optimism remains low in light of the ongoing dispute.</p>

          <p>A bill passed by the House proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, aiming to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" to fund tax cuts and increased border and defense spending. The bill includes around $600 billion in Medicaid cuts, potentially causing 10.9 million people to lose coverage over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SNAP cuts are estimated at $230 billion over 10 years, with stricter eligibility requirements and cost-sharing for states. These changes could impact access to healthcare and food assistance for millions of Americans, especially low-income individuals and families. (not investment advice)</p>

The ICC has expressed its disapproval of the sanctions, asserting they undermine the independence of the court and harm victims seeking justice.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Democratic Party's problems extend beyond leadership, requiring a fundamental adaptation to a new historical era. The author suggests that the party needs visionaries and individuals willing to shift their entire worldview. The piece contrasts the Democrats' struggles with the Republicans' more effective adjustment to the populist zeitgeist. The author posits that the Democrats must address the underlying sense of social distrust and alienation driving the current political climate.</p>

          <p>A US State Department spokesperson asserted that attendees of the upcoming World Cup and Olympics should support President Donald Trump's restrictions on travel from 19 countries. The spokesperson claimed the restrictions were necessary for security, despite concerns about the ban's impact on athletes and visitors. The order includes exceptions for athletes and related personnel traveling for major sporting events, but leaves some ambiguity regarding specific events and visa types. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and could negatively affect international participation in US-hosted events.</p>

          <p>Economists anticipate a slowdown in hiring for May, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics expected to report a gain of just 125,000 nonfarm payrolls. This decline reflects concerns about higher tariffs and economic uncertainty, potentially impacting consumer spending. The report will be a balancing act between fears of a slowing labor market and rising inflation. Data from ADP showed private payrolls essentially flat last month, and jobless claims have been edging higher, suggesting a potential shift in the labor market.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Los Angeles have charged Erick Romero Quintana, a street racing influencer, with 16 counts of conspiracy for allegedly organizing "street takeovers" via his Instagram account. The charges stem from events where racers and spectators blocked traffic while motorists performed dangerous stunts. One event resulted in the death of a 24-year-old girl. Prosecutors are taking a novel approach by targeting individuals involved in the racing scene who aren't drivers, aiming to curb the dangerous and often deadly nature of these events.</p>

          <p>NATO defense ministers signaled broad support for a historic increase in defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of gross domestic product, in response to the growing threat from Russia. Secretary General Mark Rutte proposed a division of the spending goal, allocating 3.5% to "core defense spending" and 1.5% to "defense- and security-related investment." The increase is driven by pressure from the US and concerns over European security, but could strain public finances amid economic challenges. The world's most powerful defense alliance is set to gather in three weeks in The Hague to further discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine, and Russia's resulting massive rearmament drive.</p>
