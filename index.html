          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, are showcasing their latest electric vehicle models at the Shanghai motor show, aiming to regain ground in the competitive Chinese market. This effort occurs amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, marked by retaliatory tariffs that have disrupted the automotive industry. The show features approximately 1,000 companies and highlights the rapid shift towards new energy vehicles in China, where they accounted for around 45% of new car sales in 2024. Some Chinese automakers are also presenting advanced driver-assistance systems powered by AI.</p>

          <p>Tesla is carefully planning its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, citing concerns over high import tariffs and luxury taxes that could double the price of Tesla vehicles in India. While India is seen as a potentially lucrative market due to its large middle class, the country's protectionist policies present significant obstacles for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk recently discussed technology and innovation collaboration with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling continued interest despite the challenges.

          <p>Canada has seen a record early voter turnout with 7.3 million ballots cast in advance of the upcoming election, marking a 25% increase from the previous election.

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms and gas distributors may need to renegotiate long-term LNG contracts with US providers due to the escalating US-China trade war, according to S&P Global analysts. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since February 10, when Beijing imposed tariffs on the fuel in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods. While US LNG accounted for a small percentage of China's total imports, the volumes were expected to grow significantly. Chinese buyers hold numerous long-term procurement contracts with US producers, but these may be affected by the ongoing trade conflict.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the People's Daily highlights that China needs to strengthen its punishment for academic misconduct, which is seen as a persistent problem that threatens the nation's innovation push. The article argues that despite efforts to improve research integrity, academic dishonesty remains frequent due to weak penalties. Such misconduct wastes resources, undermines fair competition, and damages China's international reputation in the scientific community. This call for stricter measures comes as China accelerates its hi-tech drive to achieve technological self-sufficiency amidst competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least two dozen people in Pahalgam.

The attack is unusual, as tourists have rarely been targeted on such a scale in the region's long-running insurgency. Security measures have been heightened, and investigations are underway, with no group yet claiming responsibility for the attack.</p>

          <p>Campaigners assert that Instagram still presents serious risks to children, even with the introduction of Teen Accounts designed to provide enhanced protection. Researchers were able to create fake accounts using false birthdays and were subsequently exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. Meta, Instagram's parent company, claims its new accounts offer built-in protections, but the 5Rights Foundation's research suggests otherwise. The findings come as Ofcom, the UK regulator, prepares to release its children's safety codes under the Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging year due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, leading to price competition. With exports to the US likely to be impacted by higher tariffs, producers are projected to cut capital expenditure, potentially shrinking the annual expansion of battery energy-storage systems. Excess supply has also contributed to a price war, causing export prices to decline. BESS devices are crucial for storing energy from renewable sources, with China and the US accounting for a significant portion of installed capacity.</p>
