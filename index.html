        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi states that US strikes have caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, creating a major setback for their program. He emphasizes the urgent need for diplomatic reconnection to re-establish inspections, as the agency currently cannot account for all of Iran's highly enriched uranium or centrifuges. Grossi acknowledges the knowledge and industrial capacity for a nuclear program remains in Iran, stressing that a lasting solution can only be diplomatic, not military. The interview highlights the profound uncertainty surrounding the program's current state and future.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile sand tiger shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach, Long Island. Officials from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation came to this conclusion after examining photos of her injuries, which included gashes and teeth marks. The woman received immediate medical attention and was taken to a hospital for stitches before being released. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended and authorities conducted drone searches for marine threats, though none were found.</p>

The organization, which is backed by former President Trump, stated it has received credible reports of these bounties and that armed operatives have been positioned near aid zones to disrupt their operations. This follows a previous deadly attack on GHF workers. GHF is calling for international condemnation of these actions, asserting that Hamas prefers chaos over humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a massive 940-page budget bill, a cornerstone of President Trump's agenda, ahead of a July 4th deadline. The legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts, has caused rifts within the party over proposed cuts to welfare programs like SNAP and Medicaid to offset the costs. Last-minute revisions were made to appease moderate holdouts, including changes to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap and exemptions for rural hospitals. Despite White House pressure, the bill's passage remains uncertain due to opposition from some rank-and-file members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A week after the US attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the extent of the damage. While President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports, including from the Defense Intelligence Agency, suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. Officials later shifted their focus, emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than guaranteeing the complete destruction of nuclear facilities. This evolution in messaging highlights the ongoing uncertainty about the mission's true impact and objectives.</p>

The government's communications authority issued an emergency order, later revoked by judges, to ban live coverage of the demonstrations, which security forces met with live ammunition. Journalists and activists report being targeted, and critics argue the government is using a 2018 cybercrime law as a weapon against dissent.

Budapest's mayor declared the march a municipal event to bypass the ban, though attendees still risked fines.

          <p>A group of more than 70 authors, including Dennis Lehane and Lauren Groff, has published an open letter urging major publishing houses to curtail their use of artificial intelligence. The letter asks publishers to pledge not to release books created by machines, replace employees with AI, or use AI for audiobook narration without human involvement. The authors express concern that AI poses an existential threat to art and artists, citing issues like copyright infringement and the proliferation of AI-generated copycat books. This direct appeal to publishers marks a new strategy in authors' efforts to protect their work from AI.</p>

          <p>British authorities have seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port, a shipment with an estimated street value of Â£96 million ($132 million). The drugs were discovered hidden beneath dozens of shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. This marks the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the UK. Border Force officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle cocaine into the country, which is one of Europe's largest markets for the drug. The seizure highlights ongoing efforts to disrupt international drug trafficking operations.</p>
