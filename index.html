          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, comprising 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 individuals who died from HIV/Aids in the UK, is being showcased at the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The quilt, created in 1994 by loved ones of the deceased, serves as a reminder of those lost and offers a chance for collective grieving. The project was initiated by Scottish activist Alistair Hulme after witnessing the American version of the quilt, with individuals like Frankie O'Reilly and Cathy John contributing panels to honor their loved ones and aid in their healing process. The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to allow more people to view the quilt and provide an opportunity to grieve after the stigma surrounding HIV prevented proper mourning in the past. The quilt includes tributes to notable figures like novelist Bruce Chatwin and actors Denham Elliot and Ian Charleston, symbolizing love, friendship, and dedication.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively developing its domestic AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor imports. The U.S. curbs hinder China's access to critical technologies across the semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. The Chinese government is investing heavily to bridge these gaps, achieving some breakthroughs but still facing significant challenges. Huawei's HiSilicon is emerging as a potential competitor to Nvidia, with its Ascend 910B and upcoming 910C GPUs showing progress, though still lagging behind Nvidia's offerings; SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is working to improve its manufacturing capabilities, but remains behind TSMC in advanced chip production. Despite these efforts, China's AI chip ecosystem still faces hurdles, particularly in acquiring advanced chipmaking equipment and memory components.</p>

          <p>Approximately 2,800 service members, including 2,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines, have been deployed to the Los Angeles region in response to ongoing protests. The Marines, having completed training in de-escalation and crowd control, are expected to serve alongside the National Guard troops within 48 hours. These forces operate under Task Force 51 with Title 10 status, aimed at protecting federal personnel and property, not engaging in law enforcement activities. While they can detain individuals in specific circumstances, such as preventing assault or interference with federal personnel, they are required to transfer custody to civilian law enforcement. The deployment is intended to maintain order and protect federal assets during the protests.</p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has voiced her criticism after the decision to drop the misconduct proceedings against Met Police officer Steve Rodhouse, who led an inquiry into false claims of sexual assault against her late husband. Lord Brittan was falsely accused of being involved in a paedophile ring in Westminster, based on fabricated claims by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice and child sexual offences. The Met Police investigation, Operation Midland, cost Â£2.5m and ran from 2014 to 2016, with Lord Brittan dying in 2015 before being cleared. Lady Brittan feels her trust in the Met and the police watchdog has been severely undermined, highlighting the lasting impact of the false allegations on her husband's legacy.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines present contrasting views on the chancellor's Spending Review, with some praising it as "renewing Britain" while others criticize it as a "reckless splurge". The NHS and defense are highlighted as major beneficiaries, while police and other departments may face financial constraints. Tax increases are predicted by several papers as inevitable to balance the budget, while the Daily Mirror commends the plans for prioritizing the majority over the privileged few. The Financial Times supports directing funds towards affordable housing and energy security but calls for broader tax reforms and training for construction workers and engineers. The Daily Star suggests the spending plans are a transparent bid to regain momentum from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, highlighting the region's dark legacy during the U.S. occupation. Constructed in the 1960s, the Mace B cruise missile launch site is a reminder of the Cold War tensions and the deployment of nuclear weapons on the island. The site, purchased by Soka Gakkai in 1976, was restored and opened to the public this year, drawing thousands of visitors. The missiles deployed in Okinawa could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, and were reportedly made ready during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Despite Okinawa's return to Japanese rule in 1972, the island still hosts a significant portion of U.S. military facilities, underscoring ongoing concerns about missile deployment.</p>

Each of the previous six South Korean presidents has faced criminal investigations after leaving office, leading to disastrous consequences. Lee's decision to launch special counsel investigations into Yoon's declaration of martial law and his wife's alleged corruption has sparked concerns about the concentration of power in his hands. Critics fear that Lee may use his power for personal gain, potentially undermining the country's political future, and that his actions will further entrench confrontational politics in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence after a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane were involved in a near miss over international waters in the Pacific. Japan conveyed its "serious concern" to China over the incident, which could have led to a collision, and emphasized the importance of maintaining communication at various levels. The Chinese J-15 warplane flew as close as 45 meters to the MSDF P-3C patrol plane, raising concerns about potential miscalculations.

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda against North Korea along the border, a key initiative by newly elected President Lee Jae-myung to reduce cross-border tensions. In response, North Korea appears to have halted its loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South, though official confirmation is pending. President Lee's decision aligns with his campaign promise to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea launched trash-filled balloons towards the South, escalating psychological warfare between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul has accused the White House of "immaturity" after he and his family were disinvited from the annual bipartisan White House picnic. Paul, who has raised concerns about President Trumpâ€™s policy bill and the national debt, believes the disinvitation was a retaliatory measure. Paul expressed his disappointment with the White House's actions, stating that it has diminished his respect for President Trump. He suggested that the directive may have originated from lower-level staff members, potentially including Stephen Miller, whom Paul criticized for disregarding constitutional principles.</p>

The review has been described as a "spend now, tax later" approach, with predictions of future tax increases to balance the books.

The review coincides with US pressure on Australia and the UK to increase military spending, with both countries responding differently.
