          <p>Vance Boelter is scheduled to appear in court, facing charges of murder and attempted murder, after allegedly shooting two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were wounded in the attacks. The suspect, dressed as a police officer, engaged in a shootout with officers before fleeing, leading to a two-day manhunt.

          <p>Home decor and furniture retailer At Home has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring effort to eliminate $2 billion in debt and obtain $200 million in capital.

At Home expects to transition ownership to its lenders, with most stores remaining open and continuing to serve customers in-store and online.

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has requested a simplified verdict form as jurors deliberate in her retrial for the death of Boston police officer John O'Keefe. Read is accused of fatally hitting O'Keefe with her SUV during a blizzard in January 2022, following a drunken argument, while the defense argues that no collision occurred and suggests an alternative suspect. The first trial ended with a deadlocked jury, and Read now faces charges of second-degree murder, drunken driving manslaughter, and leaving the scene of a deadly accident. The judge provided jury instructions before deliberations began, and Read could face life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge.</p>

          <p>Florida biologists have removed 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, marking a significant milestone in the state's efforts to curb the python population. The conservancy has also shattered their previous record for a single-season haul. The removal efforts, which focus on tracking and capturing breeding females, have prevented an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013. Experts acknowledge that complete eradication is unlikely but emphasize the positive impact of each python removed, leading to some demographic shifts and a decrease in larger-sized pythons in certain areas.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is set to launch three new ad features globally across its messaging app, with the new ads appearing in a separate section called Updates. The Meta-owned platform says the new ads will not be shown in the same place as people's private chats, nor will the contents of their messages be used to decide which ads to display. WhatsApp will instead use the country, city and language of the user, as well as how they interact with other ads and which channels they follow, to drive suggested content. Businesses with channels will be able to choose to promote ads in the Updates section to attract new followers, and also charge a subscription to access extra content.</p>

          <p>Meta is introducing advertisements to WhatsApp, allowing businesses to run status ads within the app's Updates tab. The move marks a significant shift for the messaging app, which has historically avoided advertising. Meta will also monetize WhatsApp's Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions. The company aims to limit disruption to users by keeping ads separate from personal conversations and ensuring encryption remains in place for status updates, personal messages, and calls. Meta hopes to make WhatsApp a key part of its business strategy, with over 3 billion monthly users worldwide.</p>

The Prime Minister said the current system is not working and everyone agrees it needs reform.

The program, which charges drivers entering lower Manhattan, has resulted in fewer vehicles on the road and faster bus routes.
