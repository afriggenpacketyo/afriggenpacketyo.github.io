          <p>A coordinated law enforcement effort in Texas, named "Operation Lightning Bug," has successfully rescued more than 30 missing children and dismantled several trafficking operations. The mission, involving U.S. Marshals and San Antonio police, also led to multiple arrests and the launch of new sex trafficking investigations. Experts warn that traffickers increasingly exploit vulnerable youth, often using technology to recruit and control victims, highlighting a growing crisis that extends beyond border regions.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology company Wingtech has announced that its control over its Dutch semiconductor subsidiary, Nexperia, has been effectively frozen by a court in the Netherlands. The move follows a petition from Nexperia's own legal and financial officers and an order from the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, citing "national security" concerns. As a result, Wingtech's chairman has been suspended from his roles at Nexperia, and the company's shares have been placed under third-party management, escalating tech-related tensions between China and the EU.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos secured a narrow 13-11 victory over the New York Jets in an offense-starved NFL game played in London, extending the Jets' winless streak to six games. The Jets' offense was particularly ineffective, managing a historically low total of minus-10 net passing yards and just 82 total yards. A late 27-yard field goal by Wil Lutz put the Broncos ahead, and their defense sealed the win by sacking Jets quarterback Justin Fields nine times throughout the contest.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its twelfth day, Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of "hostage-taking" for refusing to pass a funding measure without negotiations. Democratic leaders are demanding the extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support, while Republican leadership insists there is nothing to negotiate until the government is reopened. The impasse continues with both sides trading blame, and the White House has begun issuing layoff notices to thousands of federal workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas college student, Megan Ashlee Davis, is facing intense online harassment after her real mugshot was used in a fabricated viral story. The phony post claimed she was an Olive Garden waitress arrested for throwing breadsticks at customers, and it was shared by a Facebook page with over 1.7 million followers.

          <p>The Philippines and China are blaming each other for a tense maritime confrontation near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. The Philippines' Maritime Council condemned Chinese forces for using water cannons and ramming a Filipino vessel that was anchored to protect local fishermen. Conversely, China's coast guard claimed that Philippine government vessels "illegally entered" its waters and "dangerously approached" a Chinese ship, leading to the collision. The incident, condemned by the U.S. Ambassador, further escalates ongoing territorial disputes in the strategic waterway.</p>

Kennedy explains that these "Western ideas" provided the perspective he sought to apply throughout his career, from a young lawyer taking over his father's practice to becoming one of only 116 justices in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White, known for his award-winning role in "The Bear," is taking on the challenge of playing music icon Bruce Springsteen in a new film. The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's deeply personal 1982 album, "Nebraska," a period when the musician was grappling with his own mental health. White reveals that he connected with Springsteen's feeling of being an "outsider and observer" in his own life, a sentiment the actor found familiar from his own experiences before finding focus and peace through acting.</p>
