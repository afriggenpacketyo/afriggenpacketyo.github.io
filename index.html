        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's births fell below 700,000 in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year and hitting a record-low fertility rate of 1.15. This highlights the ongoing trend of delayed marriages and childbirths in the country. The number of marriages increased slightly, but the natural decrease in population reached a postwar high. These figures underscore the urgency of addressing Japan's demographic challenges, as projections had not anticipated such a sharp decline until 2039. Optimism surrounding this matter is low due to the speed of the birth rate decline.</p>

          <p>US workers are wary of Donald Trump's endorsement of Nippon Steel's takeover bid for US Steel, with some calling it a "snake-oil salesman's pitch." Despite Trump's claims that the deal will create jobs, workers remain uncertain about their employment and potential improvements to their plants. Concerns persist about Nippon Steel's past violations of US trade laws and the lack of binding commitments to protect workers' interests. The United Steel Workers union emphasizes the need for concrete details and solidarity to ensure workers benefit from the deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decision to ban the question of Palestine from the list of issues for the 2026 national school elections in Denmark has sparked controversy. The speakers of parliament justified the decision, arguing that the issue was too explosive for classroom deliberations. Critics argue that excluding the question of Palestine goes against Danish values of freedom of expression. The controversy exposes a flaw in Denmark's current order, with the government prioritizing alliances with the US and Israel over human rights in Gaza.</p>
