          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly evaluating eleven candidates to succeed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May, with new names like Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder joining the list. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct interviews to narrow down the selection, signaling a comprehensive and potentially lengthy decision-making process that aims to prevent disruption to monetary policy. The diverse pool of candidates, many with experience in monetary policy and financial markets, are being considered as the administration seeks a new leader for the central bank. This deliberate approach underscores a focus on stability and expertise, despite the President's past criticisms of the current Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Venezuelan civic group and several migrants have filed a lawsuit against federal immigration agencies, challenging the Trump administration's "sudden and unlawful termination" of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans. The plaintiffs argue that the revocation disregards legal rights, disrupts established lives, and risks deportation for individuals who complied with all DHS requirements, including the CBP One process. This legal battle emerged after the Supreme Court permitted the reversal of the Biden-era TPS extension, which had provided protection for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants. The Department of Homeland Security, however, defends the policy as an essential correction to what it terms the previous administration's "industrial-scale catch-and-release scheme."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain, France, and Germany (the E3) have threatened to trigger the "snapback" mechanism to reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran, as an August 2025 deadline looms for Tehran to resume nuclear negotiations. The E3's letter to the UN underscores their commitment to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, particularly after a recent conflict between Iran and Israel and Iran's suspension of ties with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Diplomatic efforts have stalled, and Iran's continued enrichment of uranium close to weapons-grade levels heightens international concern. The E3 states that renewed cooperation with the IAEA could delay sanctions, but a return to diplomacy is urged.</p>

          <p>Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp reported being pelted with bottles and having a knife pulled on him while visiting a migrant camp in northern France. Philp, who was assessing the "illegal migration crisis," described the incident as deeply shocking, underscoring the volatile conditions on the ground. This event highlights escalating tensions amid increasing Channel crossings, with over 170,000 arrivals recorded since 2018. The Conservative party criticizes the Labour government's 'one-in, one-out' agreement with France, advocating for immediate removal of all illegal migrants, while human rights organizations condemn such policies as undermining the fundamental right to seek sanctuary.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is forecast to strengthen into the Atlantic season's first hurricane, potentially reaching major hurricane status. Currently located east of the Leeward Islands with 45 mph winds, it is moving westward and expected to become a hurricane by late Thursday or early Friday. While not an immediate threat to the U.S., its longer-term path remains uncertain. The storm has already caused significant flooding and at least eight deaths in Cabo Verde, prompting a state of emergency there. This development marks the fifth named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season, with forecasters predicting an above-normal season.</p>

          <p>Cava's stock plummeted over 20% in premarket trading after the company lowered its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth due to a disappointing second quarter. The restaurant chain now anticipates 4% to 6% growth, down from its prior range of 6% to 8%, despite reporting higher earnings per share than expected. While Cava's 2.1% same-store sales growth still bucked industry trends of declines, it fell significantly short of Wall Street's 6.1% projection. The company attributes the slowdown to the anniversary of its popular grilled steak launch, reflecting broader struggles within the fast-casual restaurant sector, as rivals also report slumping sales.

          <p>A new study suggests that microplastics, tiny plastic fragments, may significantly disrupt photosynthesis in plants, potentially reducing crop yields by up to 13.5% and threatening global food security. These particles, absorbed through soil and water, can impede plant growth and are increasingly found in ecosystems. Experts caution that while research is a new field, the findings are concerning, especially given the lack of global data on soil contamination, particularly in the Global South. The issue is exacerbated by agricultural practices and overall plastic pollution, emphasizing the critical need to reduce plastic production to mitigate future impacts on food systems and climate change.</p>

          <p>California is challenging the legality of the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it violated the Posse Comitatus Act and caused public "anxiety and fear." Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit contends the troops were unlawfully used for immigration enforcement, creating a "standing army" in civilian life. Federal lawyers, however, assert the deployment was legal, aimed at protecting federal property and personnel, and that the President had the authority to call up forces during what he deemed a "rebellion." The ongoing bench trial highlights a contentious debate over executive power and military involvement in domestic law enforcement, with the judge questioning the scope of presidential discretion.</p>

          <p>The iconic Barbie doll was surprisingly inspired by Bild Lilli, a German pin-up doll created in 1952 for the Bild tabloid newspaper, initially targeting male readers. Lilli, described as a "sensual" and "sassy secretary" (interpreted by some as a high-class call girl), quickly became a popular plastic doll sold in tobacco shops and bars, not originally intended for children. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered Lilli in Switzerland in 1956 and subsequently bought the rights, transforming Lilli's aesthetic into the world-renowned Barbie in 1959. This origin reveals Barbie's roots in a sexualized caricature before becoming a dominant children's toy and cultural phenomenon.</p>

          <p>China claims it warned and "drove away" the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, for "illegally entering" its territorial waters near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The Chinese defense ministry accused the U.S. of infringing its sovereignty and undermining regional stability. The U.S. Seventh Fleet, however, stated the USS Higgins was conducting a "freedom of navigation operation" in accordance with international law, asserting that China's statement was false and would not deter them. This incident escalates tensions in the strategically vital waterway, following a recent collision between Chinese and Filipino vessels in the same area, highlighting ongoing territorial disputes.</p>

          <p>Mortgage refinancing demand jumped 23% last week, marking its strongest period since April, driven by a slight decrease in average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to 6.67%. This surge in refinancing, alongside a 25% increase in adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) applications, indicates homeowners are actively seeking savings despite the riskier nature of ARMs. The average ARM rate fell to 5.80%, making them relatively more attractive. While refinancing soared, applications for new home purchases saw only a modest 1% rise, suggesting that lower rates primarily benefit existing homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments.

This trend significantly impacts local economies, as festivals generate thousands in revenue for vendors and authorities. Beyond financial losses, the cancellations disrupt community relations and social capital, highlighting the profound effects of the Trump administration's sweeping deportation efforts on immigrant communities, even those with legal status, as polling shows widespread fear among Latino voters.</p>

In the film, Justine's lack of a family reinforces her culpability in the eyes of the community, despite her own confusion about the events. The film balances this grim reality with humor and Justine's resilience, as she navigates paranoia and harassment while attempting to uncover the truth, ultimately emerging as the heroine.</p>
