          <p>Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, strongly condemned the recent U.S.-Russia summit as a "historic embarrassment for the United States." In an interview, Crow argued that the Trump administration fails to apply the necessary pressure that would motivate Vladimir Putin to negotiate seriously, namely economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and the threat of military defeat. He asserted that rolling out a red carpet for Putin ignores Russia's role as the aggressor and undermines Ukraine's position as the victim. Crow also criticized the administration for what he views as a slow and insufficient approach to aiding Ukraine throughout the war.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that a lasting peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Moscow and Kyiv. Speaking after President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, Rubio stated that if one side gets everything it wants, it's surrender, which neither side is close to. He outlined that key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, the demarcation of territories, and plans for rebuilding the country. The administration's goal is to make enough progress to facilitate a direct meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin to finalize a deal and end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes summit in Alaska, a special U.S. envoy announced a potential Russian concession regarding the war in Ukraine. According to envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. Witkoff described this development as "game-changing," suggesting it could be a crucial workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. European leaders cautiously welcomed the news, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy noted that specific details on how such a guarantee would function remain unclear.</p>

          <p>A draft of an upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report from the Trump administration does not recommend significant new restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods. This development is seen as a victory for the agriculture industry and a potential setback for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been a vocal critic of chemical additives in the food supply. Instead of bans, the draft report calls for more precise pesticide application and further research. The language could still be altered before the final release, but it suggests a more moderate approach than what some of Kennedy's supporters had hoped for.</p>

Rising to fame in the 1960s, he earned an Oscar nomination for his debut role in "Billy Budd" and became a symbol of Swinging London. He was renowned for playing sophisticated villains, most famously as General Zod in the "Superman" films, but also showcased his range in roles like the transgender woman Bernadette in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." After a period of disillusionment and travel, he successfully reinvented his career and continued acting well into his 80s, leaving a legacy of memorable performances.</p>

In the second quarter, the conglomerate sold 7% of its Apple stake and 4% of its Bank of America shares, continuing a year-long trend. Concurrently, Berkshire initiated a new $1.57 billion position in UnitedHealth Group, a major healthcare insurer whose stock has fallen significantly this year amid rising medical costs and a Department of Justice investigation.

The gathering underscores European concerns that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable peace deal.

The demonstrations, which marked an escalation in public frustration after 22 months of war, saw confrontations with police, who used water cannons and made dozens of arrests. Organizers from hostage families fear that a planned military offensive could further endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held captive.

          <p>A stunning free-kick by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a little-known rule regarding player positioning. The goal was nullified because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to IFAB Law 13, when three or more defenders form a wall, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance until the ball is in play. This rule was introduced in the 2019-20 season to prevent attackers from interfering with the wall, which often caused delays and management issues for referees.</p>

The downfall of several cadres, including the former chairmen of Tibet and Ningxia, suggests that the previous unwritten rule of leniency for non-Han officials in elite politics no longer applies. Historically, top government posts in autonomous regions were reserved for members of the local ethnic group to promote inclusion.

This trend complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions, as the central bank must balance its goals of price stability and maximum employment. While a recent jobs report suggested a softening labor market that would support a rate cut, the hotter-than-expected inflation data could argue for more restraint. Markets are still pricing in a high probability of a rate cut in September, but some economists believe the broad-based inflationary pressures warrant caution. (not investment advice)</p>

By simply attending, Putin undermined Western efforts to isolate him and sowed further distrust between the U.S. and its European allies.

For the 2025-26 season, the competition was renamed the Franz Beckenbauer Super Cup in honor of the legendary Bayern player who passed away last year. The win provides an early boost for Bayern as they head into the new domestic season. Prior to the game, Stuttgart officials dismissed rumors that their striker, Nick Woltemade, was being targeted for a transfer to Bayern.</p>

          <p>Ronnie Rondell Jr., a veteran Hollywood stuntman best known for being set on fire for the iconic cover of Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" album, has died at 88. His extensive career spanned decades and included stunt work and coordination on numerous films and TV shows like "Lethal Weapon," "Diamonds are Forever," and "Baywatch." The famous 1975 album cover photograph required him to be set ablaze 15 times, with one take slightly burning his face when the wind shifted. A co-founder of the company Stunts Unlimited, Rondell was highly respected in the industry and received a lifetime achievement award in 2004 for his contributions.</p>

          <p>The daughter of renowned Chinese artist Fan Zeng has claimed that her 87-year-old father has been "taken away" by his new, much younger wife and is now missing. In a social media post, Fan Xiaohui expressed deep anxiety for her father's safety after losing contact with him in early July. Upon returning to his Beijing home from overseas, she found the house sealed and empty. She also alleged that most of her father's valuable possessions, presumably including his famous artworks, have disappeared. Fan Zeng announced his marriage to Xu Meng, a TV presenter reportedly 50 years his junior, in 2023.</p>

          <p>Despite public anticipation, the grand jury transcripts from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking case are unlikely to contain significant new information, according to legal experts and the presiding judge. A federal judge rejected a Department of Justice motion to unseal the documents, stating they are not an "untapped mine lode" and that the public would feel "disappointed and misled." This has renewed questions about whether other investigative files related to Jeffrey Epstein will ever be released. Critics and victims' advocates argue the Trump administration has the power to release non-grand jury documents but is choosing not to, fueling public perception of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Community violence prevention advocates argue that the Trump administration's focus on a militarized law enforcement response to crime in cities like Washington D.C. is misguided and ineffective. They contend that this approach ignores the success of community-based intervention programs, which work to address the root causes of violence by engaging directly with those most at risk. Leaders in the field state that long-term safety is built through investment in local infrastructure and programming, not just police response. They express concern that the administration's rhetoric and recent funding cuts to their organizations undermine years of progress in reducing homicides in urban areas.</p>

          <p>Two years ago, Eric Vaughan, CEO of software company IgniteTech, laid off nearly 80% of his workforce due to their resistance to rapidly adopting artificial intelligence. He says he would do it again, citing the company's subsequent success, including launching new AI products and achieving a 75% EBITDA margin. Vaughan found that technical staff were often the most resistant, focusing on AI's limitations rather than its potential. The company underwent a massive cultural and structural reorganization, centralizing all divisions under a new AI organization to foster belief and accelerate innovation, a move he describes as a painful but necessary business transformation.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the dispute to binding arbitration, referring the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which mandated a return to work. The union, which is seeking higher pay and compensation for ground time, accused the government of violating workers' rights by caving to corporate pressure. While the airline expects to begin restoring service, it warned that it could take up to ten days to fully stabilize its flight schedule.</p>
