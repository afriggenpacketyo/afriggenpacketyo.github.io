          <p>Singapore experienced a cooler-than-expected inflation rate in July, dropping to 0.6%, its lowest point since January 2021. This figure was below economists' forecasts and June's 0.8%, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has already eased monetary policy twice this year, anticipating a global trade slowdown and projecting lower core inflation for 2025. The nation faces potential weaker growth and trade tensions, including a baseline tariff on exports to the U.S. from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at approximately $7 billion. The company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This restructuring aligns with China's efforts to consolidate its automotive sector and enhance competitiveness. Despite a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed 33%, with VOYAH series sales soaring 84.8%.</p>

Despite a 2007 commitment to dual the entire stretch, the project's completion has been delayed from 2025 to 2035, with over 80% of fatalities occurring on undualled sections.

          <p>Reform UK, currently leading in national opinion polls, is urging energy firms to prepare for fracking, proposing to lift the ban if elected. The party believes the UK possesses hundreds of billions in shale gas, deeming it financially negligent to leave it untapped. Despite previous government attempts failing due to planning delays, minor earthquakes, and protests, Reform UK plans to conduct monitored tests within two years to assess viability. This stance contrasts sharply with the Labour government's intention to permanently ban fracking and focus on renewable energy by 2030.</p>

          <p>SpaceX rescheduled its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from Starbase, Texas, after encountering an issue with ground systems during fueling. This comes after three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures, with this test aiming to evaluate numerous upgrades and deliberately stress the vehicle. The flight plan included a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf and for Starship in the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and performing an in-space engine restart. The Starship program is crucial for launching next-generation Starlinks and NASA's Artemis moon missions, with the latter requiring 10-20 successful refueling flights.</p>

          <p>Hopes are fading for Natalia Nagovitsyna, an experienced mountaineer, who has been stranded on Kyrgyzstan's Jengish Chokusu, or Victory Peak, for 12 days after breaking her leg. Rescue efforts have been repeatedly terminated due to extreme weather conditions, which also claimed the life of another climber, Luca Sinigaglia. A surveillance drone last spotted Nagovitsyna on August 19, believed to be alive, but heavy snowfall has since suspended the search. Victory Peak, one of the world's northernmost 7,000-meter mountains, is notorious for its harsh conditions and short climbing season.</p>

          <h2>Mississippi Declares Public Health Emergency Amid Rising Infant Mortality Rate</h2>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency as the state's infant mortality rate surged to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday. The declaration aims to expand prenatal services, regionalize obstetric care, and strengthen community health programs. Experts warn that federal funding cuts to maternal and infant health initiatives, coupled with Mississippi's non-expansion of Medicaid, could further exacerbate these deeply entrenched inequities, impacting access to vital care.</p>

          <p>Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones caused an overnight fire at a nuclear plant in the Kursk region, coinciding with Ukraine's Independence Day. The fire was quickly extinguished, with a transformer damaged but radiation levels remaining normal and no injuries reported. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones, while Ukraine's air force stated 48 of 72 Russian drones and a cruise missile were shot down or jammed. UN nuclear watchdog expressed awareness but had not independently confirmed the incident, reiterating the need to protect nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>A limited number of National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C., likely fewer than 50, have been authorized to carry service-issued weapons starting Sunday night. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued the order as part of President Trump's law enforcement crackdown on what he claims is an "epidemic of crime" in the capital. This decision marks an escalation in the federal intervention, despite local officials stating that violent crime has been declining. Troops are instructed to use force only as a last resort in response to imminent threats, though no such threats have been reported.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's recent rally, attributing it to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signal for interest rate cuts, driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring. He argues that the market's previous negative bias was misguided, as tariffs' inflationary impact would be muted compared to joblessness. Cramer advises investors to focus on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, with specific stock recommendations like Toll Brothers and Goldman Sachs. He also identifies pain points in healthcare and enterprise software, while highlighting the significance of Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging France was not doing enough to combat antisemitism, calling the claims "unacceptable." The French foreign ministry cited international law on non-interference in internal affairs, stating the allegations fall short of transatlantic partnership quality. This diplomatic discord follows Macron's rejection of similar accusations from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's intent to recognize a Palestinian state. The incident adds to existing U.S.-France tensions over trade and U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a definitive end to its trading after a spectacular collapse under massive debt. Once valued at over $50 billion, the company's shares lost more than 99% of their value. Founder Hui Ka Yan was fined and banned for life from China's capital market for overstating revenue by $78 billion. The delisting underscores the ongoing property crisis, which has significantly impacted China's economy, leading to layoffs, reduced consumer spending, and a decline in household savings.</p>

          <p>New Justice Department filings allege that Smartmatic executives, already indicted for bribery, funneled money from a 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into slush funds previously used for bribes. Prosecutors aim to demonstrate a pattern of corruption, though it's unclear if LA County funds directly paid bribes. Fox News, currently facing a defamation suit from Smartmatic, claims LA County's registrar may have received undeclared gifts from the company, suggesting an unusually close relationship. Smartmatic denies wrongdoing, stating its operations are ethical, while LA County maintains its contract was competitively bid and compliant.</p>
