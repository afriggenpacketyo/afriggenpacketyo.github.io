          <h2>NYC Rent Guidelines Board Considers Rent Increases for Stabilized Apartments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-30 20:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board is considering rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising landlord costs. The nine-member panel is weighing increases between 1.75% and 4.75% for one-year leases and 4.75% to 7.75% for two-year leases, a decision impacting leases starting on or after October 1st. Tenant advocates argue the increases exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords claim they are insufficient to cover rising expenses like insurance and fuel. The board's decision, influenced by the mayor's priorities, seeks to balance tenant affordability with landlord profitability, a political issue in the city's housing market.</p>

          <p>An 18-wheeler carrying eight million dimes for the U.S. Mint overturned on U.S. Route 287 in Alvord, Texas, resulting in a massive spill of freshly minted coins. The accident, which occurred early Tuesday morning, led to the closure of southbound lanes for approximately 14 hours as crews used vacuum trucks and shovels to collect the scattered dimes. The driver and passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries and were later released from a hospital. While initial rumors suggested $8 million had been spilled, the actual amount was $800,000, sparking jokes about residents metal detecting, though no crowds ever materialized.</p>

          <p>US new car sales experienced a significant surge in March as buyers rushed to purchase vehicles ahead of impending tariff increases, with sales jumping over 17% from February and nearly 12% from March of the previous year. However, economists warn that this surge may lead to lower sales later in the year as demand is pulled forward. A 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts took effect on April 3rd, leading dealerships to stock up on pre-tariff vehicles in anticipation of higher prices. President Trump announced relief to US automakers by ensuring they are not also levied with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student with a green card, has been released from ICE detention after a federal judge in Vermont ruled his detention may have been retaliatory for his pro-Palestinian activism. Mahdawi was taken into custody on April 16th during his U.S. citizenship interview, sparking legal challenges asserting his First Amendment rights were violated. The Justice Department plans to appeal the court order. The government argued Mahdawi's presence in the U.S. had adverse foreign policy consequences due to alleged antisemitism related to the protests, a justification also used in other similar cases.</p>

          <p>Russell Defreitas, a New York drug kingpin, was sentenced to 53 years in prison after being convicted of operating as a major drug trafficker. Defreitas was found guilty on 91 charges related to a cocaine and fentanyl trafficking operation that resulted in two overdose deaths. The incident occurred in May 2023 when two victims overdosed in a hotel room booked under Defreitas' name, and he directed associates not to call 911, removed evidence, and went to Wendy's. Authorities later found drugs, firearms, and other incriminating evidence during searches of his trailer and hotel room, highlighting the need for stronger legislation like Chelsey's Law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure amid concerns about potential economic disruption. The resolution, which would have terminated the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, fell short of the necessary votes in a 49-49 vote. The tariffs, announced on April 2, include a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners, though the President announced a 90-day pause on most of the new tariffs. The vote underscores ongoing anxieties about the economic impact of the tariffs, particularly following a report indicating slowed economic growth in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Microsoft shares rose approximately 9% after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by its Azure cloud business, and issued surprisingly strong guidance. Revenue increased 13% year over year, and net income climbed 18%. The company's optimistic forecast provided some relief to investors concerned about how tech businesses will fare amid President Trump's tariffs. Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on data center construction for artificial intelligence, requiring substantial imports. The company's Azure revenue grew 33%, with 16 points of the growth associated with AI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has contacted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele regarding the detention of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly deported to a Salvadorian prison, though Bukele rejected the outreach. The Supreme Court ordered the administration to return Ábrego García to the U.S. for immigration proceedings, but the administration has been reluctant to comply, testing the limits of presidential power. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the conduct of foreign policy belongs to the president and the executive branch, not a judge. A federal district court has ordered the Justice Department to respond to questions about the administration's efforts to comply with the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

The judge referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for investigation into potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple. The accusation stems from Apple's implementation of new policies in 2024 that collected a 27% commission from some off-app purchases, a slight discount from the usual 30%.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at an annual rate of 0.3% as businesses stockpiled goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. The decline marks the worst quarterly performance since early 2022, raising concerns about a potential recession. While the report may not fully reflect economic growth due to the surge in imports, economists caution that the tariffs could create headwinds for the economy later in the year. Growth was also impacted by a 5.1% decline in government spending, stemming from cuts implemented by Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>Local and mayoral elections are being held across England, marking the first major set of polls since Labour's landslide victory in last year's general election. Approximately 1,650 seats are being contested across 24 county councils, eight unitary authorities, and one metropolitan district. Six mayoral elections are also taking place. A by-election in Runcorn and Helsby will decide the new MP for the constituency, triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP. Government announced elections would be postponed in nine areas, where local authorities are being reorganized.</p>

          <p>Rodney Scott, President Trump's nominee to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is facing scrutiny for his role in an investigation into the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, who was brutally beaten by Border Patrol agents. Critics allege Scott participated in a cover-up and is unqualified to lead the agency, while his defenders say he acted appropriately. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found the U.S. responsible for Hernández Rojas’ killing and a subsequent cover-up. Scott defended his record, saying he has been transparent and that any mistakes he made were minor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's "America First" policy in his second term has sparked conflicts and chaos on the global stage, putting the U.S. at odds with traditional allies. His administration has moved quickly to implement this vision, leading to sweeping trade campaigns and tensions between the U.S. and China. Trump's international ambitions have extended to acquiring foreign territories like the Panama Canal and Greenland. Despite promises to resolve conflicts, many remain unresolved, and critics fault Trump for failing to hold the Kremlin accountable.</p>
