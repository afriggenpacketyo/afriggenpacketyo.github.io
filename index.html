        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country, asserting that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, marking the first major legal challenge to Trump's tariffs. Global markets responded positively to the ruling, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar making gains against safe-haven peers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A renowned Chinese scholar, Wu Xinbo, suggests that Beijing should anticipate Washington adopting alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations, noting the Trump administration's recognition of the limitations of imposing heavy tariffs. Wu believes that while Trump might continue using tariffs as a negotiating tool, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. He also said that China needs to be alert to the possibility that Trump may play other cards related to science, diplomacy, and security, given his awareness of the tariff card's limitations.</p>

          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind this choice, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It notes that thousands of Americans serve in Israeli ranks, some driven by a "fierce commitment to the Jewish state" and involvement in settlement activities. The piece contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians and raises concerns about the lack of attention given to the radicalization of young Zionists, while also acknowledging the historical context of antisemitism and America's affinity for Israel.</p>

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell highlights the dire situation for children in Gaza, emphasizing the growing threat of famine due to limited aid access. Russell describes the story of Miran Mohammad, a child injured in an airstrike, to illustrate the ongoing violence and humanitarian crisis. She criticizes a new aid delivery system backed by Israel, arguing it is incompatible with humanitarian principles and threatens to worsen the situation, urging a return to the UN-led aid pipeline with safe and sustained access.</p>

The Angels made several roster moves before the game, and Mike Trout is nearing his return from injury.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased, reaching an all-time high for April. However, Toyota anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the full business year due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>
