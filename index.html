          <h2>New Humanoid Robot Features Self-Swapping Battery for Continuous Operation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new humanoid robot, the Walker S2 by UBTech, can operate nearly 24/7 by autonomously swapping its own batteries. Designed for factory work, the 5-foot-3-inch robot walks to a station, replaces its depleted battery with a fresh one, and resumes its tasks in about three minutes. This innovation is part of China's significant investment in robotics and AI to advance its manufacturing sector and global competitiveness. The development signals a major step in automation, potentially transforming workplaces beyond factories into areas like warehouses and hospitals.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, averting a potential trade war ahead of an August 1 deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a lower rate than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the American economy. The deal aims to bring stability and predictability to the major transatlantic trading relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant fire has engulfed four factory units and 20 tonnes of tires in the West Midlands, UK, prompting the evacuation of nearby homes as a precaution. Over 70 firefighters and 17 fire engines were dispatched to the scene on Great Bridge Street, between Tipton and West Bromwich. The blaze has created a large plume of smoke, and residents have been advised to keep windows and doors closed. While no casualties have been reported, emergency services expect to remain at the site for a considerable time to manage the situation.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association has expressed deep concern over reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This 40-year-old independent panel provides evidence-based recommendations on preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which insurers are required to cover. Critics fear the move is politically motivated and could disrupt access to essential health services by dismantling a non-partisan, expert-driven process. The potential overhaul follows a similar removal of members from a CDC vaccine advisory panel, raising alarms among public health experts.</p>

          <p>An analytical article posits that President Trump's attempts to deflect and distract from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal are paradoxically deepening public suspicion. Having built a political base by promoting conspiracy theories about a 'deep state,' Trump now finds himself in control of that state and its secrets, yet unable to provide satisfactory answers about Epstein. This creates a dilemma where any action, or inaction, fuels further distrust among a populace already primed to believe in cover-ups.

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending four days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people. The meeting was arranged following diplomatic pressure from the U.S. and an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, acting as the chair of ASEAN. Both sides have agreed to pursue an immediate ceasefire after President Trump reportedly indicated that future trade agreements could be at risk if hostilities continued. Despite the diplomatic progress, some fighting was still reported along the contested border.</p>

          <p>German champions Bayern Munich have reportedly agreed to a deal worth up to £65.5 million (€75m) with Liverpool for Colombian forward Luis Diaz. The 28-year-old was left out of Liverpool's recent pre-season friendly squad due to the ongoing speculation about his future. Diaz, who joined Liverpool from Porto in 2022, is expected to travel to Europe to complete a medical in the coming days. The transfer comes as Liverpool has been actively signing new forwards, including Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, during the summer window.</p>

The debate comes as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more files related to the case. Johnson defended his decision to adjourn the House early, citing the need to protect victims and innocent individuals from the release of uncorroborated information.</p>

A senior commerce official said the move, along with increased imports of American goods like wheat and cotton, is intended to help narrow a $6 billion trade deficit with the U.S. The nation's key garments industry is particularly vulnerable to a potential 35% tariff hike from the Trump administration. This large aircraft purchase is seen as a significant step to defuse trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the correction, Mullin insisted the case was sealed in 2009 under President Obama, conflating the sealing of the case with the timing of the actual agreement, which allowed Epstein to serve a lenient sentence for sex trafficking crimes.</p>
