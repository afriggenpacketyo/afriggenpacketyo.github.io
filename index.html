        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and home builders are warning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats do not support a House-passed spending bill that includes reauthorization for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Administration officials argue that the looming Sept. 30 government funding deadline and the program's potential lapse put homeowners and the housing market at risk during hurricane season. Democrats are reportedly refusing to back the measure due to broader spending disputes. A lapse could disrupt thousands of property sales and leave over 250,000 households without coverage, despite FEMA having some reserves.</p>

          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first experimental rice crop in East England, a project spearheaded by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Benefiting from the hottest summer on record, this trial explores future food production and farmer livelihoods in a changing climate. Beyond food, the initiative aims to re-wet peat soils in Cambridgeshire, locking away greenhouse gases and potentially cutting national emissions. While commercial viability is still distant, the project offers a radical model for sustainable agriculture and climate mitigation, drawing government interest.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley defended American Ryder Cup fans as merely 'passionate' despite reports of unacceptable and personal insults directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, during day two at Bethpage Black. Bradley contrasted the atmosphere with what he heard about the 'violent' Ryder Cup in Rome two years prior, downplaying the severity of the home crowd's actions. European captain Luke Donald, however, criticized the personal insults and disruptions during swings, acknowledging the team's ability to perform despite the challenging environment. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between players and spectators in highly charged sporting events.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran, effective Sunday, due to its nuclear program, further straining the Islamic Republic's economy. The "snapback" mechanism, part of the 2015 nuclear deal, will freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize ballistic missile development. This comes as Iran's rial currency hits record lows, driving up food prices and increasing public anxiety over potential conflict with Israel or the U.S. Activists also fear a rise in repression, with a significant increase in executions reported this year. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, while Western powers express concern over its uranium enrichment levels.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with deals involving major companies like TikTok and CNN. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Donald Trump have reportedly facilitated these ventures, including Oracle's role with TikTok and David Ellison's acquisition of Paramount. The family is also reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, potentially creating one of the largest media conglomerates.

          <p>Thousands of protestors gathered in Buenos Aires, Argentina, demanding justice for three young women whose torture and murders were reportedly broadcast live on social media. The victims, Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez, were found buried in a yard five days after their disappearance. Investigators link the triple femicide to drug gangs, suggesting it was a "punishment" for breaking gang rules and a "warning" message. Police have arrested five suspects, though the alleged Peruvian mastermind remains at large. Instagram's parent company Meta has disputed that the livestream occurred on its platform.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, initially aimed at designing a better shoe rack, evolved into a scientific inquiry into the Kytococcus sedentarius bacterium, responsible for shoe odor. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear, effectively eliminating the smell within minutes. This quirky yet inventive scientific endeavor highlights a universal domestic problem and offers a unique solution.</p>

Starbucks, however, blames the union for walking away from talks and maintains it offers competitive pay and benefits. The union warns of potential strikes if a contract is not finalized.</p>

Assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson also received fines.

          <p>Venezuela is intensifying civilian military training, calling up its National Bolivarian Militia, in response to what President Nicolás Maduro terms a "non-declared war" by the United States. This move follows US navy strikes in the South Caribbean that reportedly killed 17 people on boats accused of carrying drugs. While experts doubt a full-scale US invasion, the deployment of naval forces has further strained already tense relations, exacerbated by the US not recognizing Maduro's re-election and accusing him of drug cartel ties. Maduro's government appears to be preparing its populace for potential conflict, with soldiers training volunteers in handling arms.</p>

          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate among dermatologists and consumers. While some users report brighter skin, thicker hair, and stronger nails, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen's ability to reach skin cells effectively when taken orally. She notes that collagen creams are largely ineffective as they don't penetrate beyond the skin's surface. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research frequently finds no substantial effect. Experts suggest that consistent sunblock use, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing "full force" if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump stated the move is to protect ICE facilities from "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists," a group he recently designated as a domestic terrorist organization. Democratic lawmakers and Oregon Governor Tina Kotek have pushed back, calling the deployment an "abuse of power" and stating there is no need for federal troops. The announcement expands the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and protest activities, raising concerns about civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a major hurricane, is swirling north of the Caribbean and could potentially interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, possibly leading to the rare Fujiwhara effect. This meteorological phenomenon occurs when two tropical storms merge or orbit a common center. While an unlikely outcome, especially if one storm is significantly weaker, the interaction could alter their forecast paths. Forecasters are closely monitoring Tropical Depression Nine, which is expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm Imelda, as it tracks towards the Bahamas and potentially the southeastern U.S. coastline.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for the United Nations, which its General Assembly President describes as being at a "make-it-or-break-it moment." The article critiques the UN's current contradictions, particularly the role of major powers like Germany and the US as arms suppliers to Israel amid the Gaza conflict. It suggests that while these nations are enablers of destruction, China's proposals might offer a path towards a more balanced and effective international body. The author implies a need for a shift in global leadership and diplomatic approaches to address contemporary crises.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 17:29:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting him firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. This latest criticism follows Trump's repeated attacks on Powell for his monetary policy, particularly his perceived cautious approach to interest rate cuts. While the Fed recently lowered rates, Trump continues to label Powell as "Too Late Powell." Firing a Fed Chair would be an unprecedented move, and a recent Supreme Court decision suggests the president lacks the authority to remove Fed officials at will. Economists fear such an action could undermine the Fed's independence and destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's indictment of former FBI director James Comey signals a dramatic escalation in President Trump's campaign of political retribution against perceived enemies. Despite campaigning on ending the "weaponization" of the Justice Department, Trump and his allies view these actions as targeting those who "deserve it." This specific case, a two-page indictment signed by a former Trump personal attorney, concerns alleged false statements to Congress regarding a leak about the Clinton Foundation investigation, a matter the Inspector General's office previously investigated with skepticism. This move reinforces Trump's "I am your retribution" promise, raising concerns about the politicization of federal law enforcement.</p>

The company's innovative manufacturing approach, exemplified by its rapid production of 82 modular homes for Lahaina wildfire victims, highlights the efficiency and quality of off-site construction. While modular homes currently represent a small fraction of new builds, their potential to provide more affordable, quicker-built housing for a broad range of aspiring homeowners, including essential workers, is gaining recognition. This model also addresses labor shortages and reduces waste in the construction industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its suppliers and protect jobs after a cyber attack halted production for weeks. The Export Development Guarantee will help JLR boost cash reserves and make backlog payments to its 700 suppliers, many of which are small businesses facing financial distress. The shutdown is estimated to cost JLR £50 million per week, impacting approximately 150,000 people in its supply chain. Both government and opposition figures welcomed the support, though some criticized the delayed response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes.</p>
