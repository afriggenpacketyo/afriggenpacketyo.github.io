          <p>This article reports that Hispanic shoppers are reducing their spending on groceries due to concerns about stricter immigration policies and economic anxieties, impacting companies like Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands. Executives have noted a decrease in spending on items ranging from beer to non-alcoholic beverages. The Latino unemployment rate has also seen a slight increase, further contributing to the decline in social gatherings where these products are often consumed. Coca-Cola specifically cited social media rumors and geopolitical tensions as factors affecting their sales among Hispanic consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, although they plan to offset $1 billion through remediation. The automotive industry is dealing with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with USMCA. The company cited potential supply chain disruptions and increased tariffs as reasons for the suspension. This is a notable impact, though less than the expected impact on General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles.</p>

          <p>According to this article, Israeli Finance Minister Bazalel Smotrich stated that Israel's victory requires the complete destruction of Gaza and the forced displacement of Palestinians to other countries. While Smotrich's statement does not reflect official Israeli government policy, it comes after the government approved a plan to control Gaza indefinitely. The plan, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, aims to prevent Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid and involves strikes against Hamas targets. The plan would only take effect if a hostage deal is not reached by the time President Donald Trump visits Israel on May 13.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses a newly declassified memo confirming that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang. Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador, asserting the gang's actions were directed by Maduro. The memo's release contradicts the administration's rationale, leading to questions about its forceful criticism of media coverage. The Justice Department had even opened a criminal investigation into leaks related to the story, further highlighting the controversy surrounding the policy.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the motivations of individuals who collaborated with the Nazi regime, focusing on the story of Austrian filmmaker G. W. Pabst. The author, Daniel Kehlmann, explores the gray zone between victim and perpetrator, examining how rationalizations and compromises led to complicity. The article highlights Pabst's decision to return to the Third Reich and direct films under Nazi supervision, questioning the extent to which art can justify moral compromise. The author suggests that avoiding the gray area altogether is the best way to prevent complicity.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Elon Musk's growing dominance over space-based internet through his company, SpaceX, and its Starlink network. With over 7,000 satellites, Starlink dwarfs all other private and national fleets, providing internet service to over 5 million people. Musk's ability to deliver this service has given him unprecedented geopolitical leverage, with political leaders recognizing the difficulty of dislodging Starlink's dominance.

Manzano's autopsy revealed he died from a combination of alcohol and Xanax, and police allege Colbert drugged and robbed him.

          <p>Germany's conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in a parliament vote to become chancellor.

The Bundestag will have another 14 days to choose a chancellor, and the far-right party has called for fresh elections.</p>
