          <p>A widespread power outage struck Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France, disrupting daily life for millions. The blackout affected public transportation, communication systems, and essential services, though backup systems maintained power for critical infrastructure like hospitals. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated the cause was unknown after 60% of Spain's electricity demand was suddenly lost. While power has been partially restored with assistance from France and Morocco, the full restoration timeline remains uncertain, and investigations are ongoing.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed the "Take It Down Act," a bipartisan bill that makes posting sexually explicit imagery online without consent a federal crime. The legislation, supported by First Lady Melania Trump, requires social media companies to remove such content, including AI-generated deepfakes, within 48 hours of a victim's request. Advocates hope the bill will prevent cyber abuse and suicides stemming from online exploitation, while digital rights groups have raised concerns about potential suppression of lawful speech and the lack of safeguards against malicious takedown requests.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, is facing questions regarding her credentials, specifically claims of being double board-certified and her medical degree. Records indicate she earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine, not the University of Arkansas School of Medicine as sometimes portrayed. These discrepancies have raised concerns about transparency and credibility, essential qualities for the Surgeon General, who serves as a public health spokesperson.</p>
