          <p>The Japanese government reported that 87 Japanese nationals and their family members were evacuated from Iran and Israel due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. The evacuees arrived in Azerbaijan and Jordan via bus, as local airports were closed, and no health issues were reported among them. The government is planning additional evacuations from Iran and intends to dispatch Self-Defense Forces planes to Djibouti to assist if airports reopen. The situation remains tense as Israel and Iran continue to exchange strikes, with Japan prioritizing the protection of its citizens. Optimism is limited given the continued volatility of the region.</p>

          <p>Niger's ruling junta announced its decision to nationalize Somair, a unit of the French uranium company Orano, escalating tensions between the two nations. The junta cited irresponsible, illegal, and disloyal behavior by Orano, which is majority-owned by the French state, as the reason for the nationalization. This decision follows a deterioration in relations after the 2023 coup, which led to France withdrawing its troops from Niger. Niger possesses significant uranium deposits, and Orano has been pursuing legal means to regain control of Somair, claiming the junta's actions are damaging the mine's finances.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden spoke at a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, criticizing what he described as ongoing efforts to erase history. He highlighted the importance of Juneteenth as a federal holiday and appeared to reference President Trump's administration, without naming him directly, for attempts to reinstate Confederate military base names. Biden emphasized the significance of remembering the events of Juneteenth and the moral stain of slavery in America's story.

          <p>A half-mile-long drug-smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego was shut down by the Border Patrol. The tunnel, equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation systems, and a track system, was discovered as it was actively under construction. The entrance in Tijuana was hidden under recently placed tile. Authorities seized a package containing methamphetamine inside the tunnel. Contractors are expected to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use, and this discovery marks the 95th tunnel found and decommissioned in the San Diego area since 1993.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that irreparable harm would occur without it. The Department of Transportation had imposed conditions on the funding, requiring states to adhere to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge agreed with the states that the government lacked a plausible connection between cooperating with ICE and the approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar increases in April and March. This surge has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate prices. Japan's core inflation rate also climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023. Experts note that rice accounts for a significant portion of Japan's core inflation, and future trends are heavily reliant on food prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns.

Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs.

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners voiced shared security concerns at a high-level summit, signaling closer ties amid a turbulent global landscape. This has sparked questions about whether Russia's regional dominance is waning as it remains preoccupied with the Ukraine war. The Kremlin has dismissed these concerns, emphasizing that China is a privileged strategic partner and Central Asian countries are natural historical partners. However, diplomatic observers note that Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence, even though Beijing is avoiding challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor.</p>

Food prices, excluding fresh items, rose by 7.7%, with rice prices more than doubling due to supply shortages.
