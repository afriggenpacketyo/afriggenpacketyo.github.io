          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 murders of their parents. Judge Michael Jesic's decision followed emotional testimonies from family members who spoke of the brothers' rehabilitation and remorse. The brothers themselves addressed the court, acknowledging their crimes and apologizing to their family. This ruling marks a significant step in their long legal battle, though the final decision on their release now rests with the state's parole board, which will consider their case on June 13 amidst Governor Newsom's clemency consideration.</p>

          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez was hospitalized after being stabbed in a California prison, where he is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is reported to be in fair condition following the alleged attack by another inmate. The incident is under investigation by the prison's investigative unit and the Kern County District Attorney's Office. Stallion has also alleged that Lanez has continued to harass her from prison through surrogates, leading to an extension of a restraining order against him, which is set to last through 2030.</p>

          <p>General practitioners in England are deeply divided over proposed legislation to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill patients, according to BBC research. A survey of over 1,000 GPs revealed differing views shaped by personal beliefs and experiences, with some supporting patient choice and dignified deaths, while others raised concerns about vulnerable patients feeling pressured or coerced. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of predicting life expectancy and the availability of adequate palliative care resources. The Royal College of Psychiatrists also expressed reservations, citing unmet patient needs and a shortage of psychiatrists to assess requests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional British television is grappling with how to survive in the face of competition from US streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. Industry insiders are debating potential solutions, including mergers between broadcasters like the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, to create stronger entities. Revenue declines, particularly for the BBC due to license fee reductions, have intensified the challenge, but there is disagreement about the best path forward, with some advocating for collaboration and shared streaming platforms like iPlayer. The industry is also considering how to adapt to a future where traditional terrestrial TV may be phased out in favor of digital-only video on demand services.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s aides quashed concerns about his age and mental acuity during his time in the White House. The book, based largely on anonymous sources, describes instances where Biden forgot names, appeared frail, and relied heavily on scripted meetings. Despite these concerns, few Biden allies were willing to speak openly about his decline, even after his departure from office. The book highlights the challenges the Democratic Party faced in addressing questions about Biden's fitness for office and the enduring fear of criticizing a once-powerful leader.</p>

The bill seeks to replace subjective standards with practical ones, defining obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>

Rose, who holds the record for career hits, agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball games. Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, has long been a controversial figure.

A BBC research suggests the findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law - and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue. BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales. More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams reportedly used at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation. Adams explained that he needed separate phones for office, personal, and campaign use, and had to acquire additional phones after federal authorities seized his devices in November 2023. The mayor's use of multiple devices was a prominent aspect of the investigation, which led to his indictment on five counts, including bribery, wire fraud, and solicitation of illegal foreign donations, though the charges were ultimately dismissed.</p>

          <p>A rock climber survived a 400-foot fall in Washington's North Cascades mountains, hiking to his car and driving to a payphone to call for help after the accident killed his three companions. The group of four were descending the Early Winters Spires when the anchor securing their ropes failed. The surviving climber, suffering from internal bleeding and head trauma, managed to extricate himself and seek assistance. Search and rescue teams recovered the bodies of the deceased and are investigating the cause of the fall, suspecting an old and weathered piton may have failed.</p>

          <p>Former Uruguayan President José Mujica, known as "Pepe", has died at the age of 89. The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's "poorest president" because of his modest lifestyle. He was known for his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted, such as the legalization of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market. He spent much of his time in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy.</p>

          <p>A judge has reduced the Menendez brothers' murder sentences, making them eligible for parole after being convicted of murdering their parents. Lyle and Erik Menendez received life sentences without the possibility of parole but Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic changed the sentence to 50 years to life. The ruling capped off a day-long hearing in which several relatives, a retired judge and a former fellow inmate testified in support of efforts to shorten the brothers' sentence. The brothers did not show any apparent emotion during much of the testimony but chuckled when one of their cousins, Diane Hernandez, told the court that Erik received A+ grades in all of his classes during his most recent semester in college.</p>
