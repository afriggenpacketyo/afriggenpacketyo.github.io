          <p>A federal judge in Vermont has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, from ICE custody after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, citing only an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding Israel and Palestine. Ozturk testified about her humanitarian work and involvement in school groups, emphasizing her commitment to child development and well-being. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Ozturk's visa was revoked due to her pro-Palestinian activism, but the judge remained unconvinced of any threat to foreign policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are increasing the prices of baby products, potentially adding up to $1,000 a year to the cost of raising a child, according to a report from CBS News. Baby gear makers and parents are feeling the pinch as tariffs on Chinese-made essentials like car seats and strollers rise. Despite the White House's stated goal of encouraging Americans to have more children, these tariffs are creating a "baby tax" on families. Some parents are turning to resale platforms to mitigate the rising costs, as manufacturers struggle to absorb the tariff increases.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that the first Chinese freight ships carrying goods subject to President Trump's increased tariffs have arrived at U.S. ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach. These ships contain goods from companies like Amazon, Home Depot, Ikea, and Ralph Lauren, including housewares, apparel, and furniture. The tariffs are causing confusion and uncertainty for businesses, leading them to continually alter their scenario planning. While Trump suggested he might lower tariffs to 80%, many businesses would still consider this rate extremely high, and the number of freight vessels heading to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the announcement.</p>

          <p>As Americans worry about maintaining their standard of living amidst rising costs and tariffs, many are adopting money-saving strategies like "no buy," "low buy," and "slow buy." These trends, popularized on TikTok, encourage consumers to cut back on non-essential spending and resist overspending due to recession fears. A study by Intuit Credit Karma found that 83% of consumers would strongly consider cutting back on non-essential spending if their financial situation worsens. While these savings challenges can provide a short-term boost, financial experts emphasize the importance of practicing good long-term financial habits.</p>

This incident follows a similar communications breakdown that led to widespread flight cancellations and delays.

          <p>The New York Times reports that a small group of Republicans is threatening to derail President Trump's fiscal agenda over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. These lawmakers, representing high-tax states, are demanding the lifting of the $10,000 limit imposed in 2017, arguing it is essential for their constituents. However, other Republicans view raising the limit as a handout to wealthy residents of blue states, complicating efforts to reach a consensus on the tax bill. The conflict over SALT, along with Medicaid, could determine the fate of the entire Republican legislative agenda.</p>

These approvals include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract (expanded use), and calcium phosphate. This move aligns with calls from officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is urging companies to phase out petroleum-based dyes.

          <p>President Trump has publicly expressed a willingness to consider raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously suggesting that Republicans should probably oppose the idea, according to CNBC. This comes after Trump reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson about adding a tax hike on the highest earners to the major tax and spending bill. Trump's comments reflect a departure from traditional Republican orthodoxy on taxing the rich, but he also acknowledged the political risks associated with such a move, referencing George H.W.

          <p>NPR reports that Vice President Vance stated that the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan is "fundamentally none of our business." Vance's comments signal a more hands-off foreign policy compared to previous administrations, which actively worked to de-escalate tensions between the two countries. Analysts express concern that this stance may embolden both sides, particularly as the conflict involves two nuclear powers. The current tensions began after gunmen killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of involvement, which Pakistan denies.</p>

          <p>The New York Times profiles Randy Carr, CEO of World Emblem, a company that produces embroidered patches, illustrating the challenges businesses face navigating President Trump's trade policies. Carr initially celebrated when his company was exempt from tariffs on Mexico, but soon realized that tariffs on China, where he sources raw materials, would also impact his business. The constant changes in trade policy create uncertainty, making it difficult for companies to plan and invest. Carr's experience highlights the complex and often unpredictable consequences of tariffs on global supply chains.</p>

The court denied the Trump administration's request to re-detain Mahdawi, finding that it was unlikely to succeed in its arguments. Mahdawi's legal team argues he was detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, violating the First Amendment.

Fortnite was removed from the App Store in 2020 after Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject Fortnite's submission.
