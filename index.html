          <h2>Intel Announces Expense Cuts Amidst Disappointing Guidance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel released its first-quarter results, surpassing analysts' expectations, but issued a disappointing forecast and revealed intentions to reduce expenses in the coming year. The company expects lower revenue for the current quarter due to macroeconomic uncertainty and fluid trade policies. CEO Lip-Bu Tan acknowledged that while the first quarter was a step in the right direction, there are no quick fixes for regaining market share and driving sustainable growth. Intel plans to cut operational and capital expenses, including job cuts, particularly for managers, to improve efficiency as they aim to compete with Nvidia in AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that users saying 'please' and 'thank you' to ChatGPT costs the company tens of millions of dollars in electricity. While it might seem trivial, every interaction with a chatbot incurs expenses due to server usage. The additional words increase the cost per interaction, accumulating to a significant amount across millions of users. Altman implies that the cost is justified by the positive user experience and the potential for improved AI behavior through positive reinforcement.</p>

However, YouTube advertising revenue fell slightly short of analyst estimates, while Google Cloud revenue was just below expectations.

          <p>The California Supreme Court has demanded that the State Bar of California provide answers regarding its use of artificial intelligence to develop multiple-choice questions for the February bar exams. The justices were not informed that the State Bar had allowed its psychometrician to use AI, raising concerns about the reliability and transparency of the questions. The court is seeking explanations on how and why AI was used, the actions taken to ensure the reliability of the questions, and whether any questions were removed due to unreliability.</p>

          <p>Project 2025, a 922-page document created by conservative policy thinkers, outlines a radical agenda for the next Republican president, focusing on transforming the federal bureaucracy, dismantling climate research, and promoting conservative social norms. The plan includes firing civil servants, changing others into political appointees, and terrifying the rest into obeisance. Many of the shocking moments of the Trump presidency so far have actually come from less prominent ideas buried across Project 2025’s 922 pages. It foretold the sacking of top generals and the repeal of Temporary Protected Status for people from Venezuela.</p>

          <p>California's economy has surpassed Japan's, making it the fourth largest in the world, with a nominal GDP reaching $4.1 trillion. Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the state's thriving economy to investments in people, sustainability, and innovation. California's growth rate in 2024 outperformed top global economies, but Newsom cautioned that the Trump administration's tariff policies endanger the state's economic interests. The state is a major contributor to national economic growth and is suing the federal government over Trump's tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is anticipating a significant drop in imports due to ongoing tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China, with Executive Director Gene Seroka predicting a 35% decline in arrivals within two weeks. The slowdown is attributed to the current tariff rates on Chinese goods and the across-the-board tariffs that apply to nearly all nations, suppressing demand from U.S. retailers and manufacturers. This decline is expected to have a ripple effect at the port, impacting truckers, dock workers, and the overall trade and logistics industry in Southern California.</p>
