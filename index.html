          <p>Four former high-ranking CDC physicians have publicly criticized the new direction of U.S. public health policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Following the firing of the CDC director, the physicians resigned, citing concerns that recent changes, particularly new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women, are not based on scientific evidence. They warn that these actions and the administration's rhetoric are eroding public trust in scientific institutions and could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. The officials expressed fear that the nation's public health infrastructure is being jeopardized by what they describe as politically motivated decisions.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has officially begun her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, a move interpreted as a reaction to her staunch criticism of the war in Ukraine. Despite some political friction in Germany over her nomination, Baerbock will now chair and manage UN meetings, aiming to act as a "unifier" and "honest broker" for all 193 member states. Her new role comes as her party transitions to an opposition role in German domestic politics.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the profound personal and familial challenges that accompanied her 2020 nomination to the high court. She describes the decision-making process with her husband, which involved a commitment to "burn the boats," meaning there would be no second-guessing their move to Washington D.C. and the public scrutiny that would follow. Barrett recounts the intense media attention and loss of privacy, including an incident where she had to scale a fence in high heels to evade reporters. The passage provides a personal glimpse into the sacrifices required for public service at the highest level.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett responded to criticisms regarding the court's ideological direction and its handling of cases related to former President Trump's executive actions. She pushed back against labels of the court shifting "right or left," stating she decides cases as they come and has been criticized by both sides. Barrett discussed the Dobbs decision, emphasizing that it returned the question of abortion to the democratic process in the states and did not make it illegal. When questioned about Trump's use of executive power, she maintained that the court's role is to decide legal questions, not to form political views on the president's actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has raised concerns about its impact on small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of the nation's 33 million small businesses are service-based and do not directly purchase international goods. While acknowledging that the change will cause price increases and affect some businesses, the author contends that the broader economy can likely absorb these costs as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The focus, it suggests, should be on the overall health of the labor market and consumer spending power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London against the UK government's proscription of the activist group Palestine Action resulted in the arrest of 890 people, according to the Metropolitan Police. The majority of arrests were for supporting a banned organization under the Terrorism Act, with an estimated 1,500 people attending the rally in Parliament Square. Police reported that the protest turned violent, with 17 officers assaulted, a claim disputed by organizers who stated they were "peacefully defying the ban." The proscription of Palestine Action in July made membership or support for the group a criminal offense, a move that is currently being challenged in court.</p>

The situation has reignited a long-standing border dispute with Peru over the sovereignty of Santa Rosa, a river island.

Prosecutors argue the activists deliberately undermined Poland's migration policy, while the defense contends they were saving lives from the illegal and dangerous practice of pushbacks.

Dr. Golshevsky suggests techniques such as recreating a womb-like environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, and ensuring the baby is well-fed and burped. He advises creating a flexible routine, emphasizing that parents should learn to interpret their baby's unique cues.</p>

Solar systems are durable, require minimal maintenance, and provide energy directly from the sun, making them a resilient power source in case of societal breakdown.

The poll also explored economic views, finding that many Americans report buying fewer items due to tariffs, though a majority of Republicans express willingness to pay more to support Trump's trade policies.

This article analyzes this pattern of hyperbole, noting its increased usage during his current term. The phrasing reflects a worldview where everything is presented in extremes—either as an unprecedented success or a historic crisis—with himself at the center. Communication experts suggest this linguistic habit translates into his governance, justifying extreme actions by framing situations in the most dramatic terms possible. This signature expression serves as an effective, if not always factually accurate, promotional tool that defines his presidency.</p>

          <p>London's public transport is facing significant disruption as London Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have commenced a five-day strike. The rolling industrial action is over disputes concerning pay and fatigue management, with the union demanding a 32-hour work week. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay raise but deems the reduced work week "neither practical nor affordable." The strike will result in little to no service on the Tube network from Monday to Thursday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground expected to be much busier than usual.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Increased Coal Power Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Renewables Grid</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's simultaneous expansion of both renewable energy and coal power is not a contradiction in its climate policy. While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, issues like grid curtailment (where generated clean power cannot be used) and weather-dependent output from sources like hydropower create instability. In this context, new coal plants are being built not as a primary energy source, but as a crucial backup system. They act as a "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability during peak demand and allowing for the aggressive integration of vast new renewable projects without risking blackouts.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for instructing its broadcast partners to avoid showing any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to Donald Trump's attendance at the US Open men's final. This opinion article condemns the decision as cowardly and hypocritical, given the tournament's history of televising other disturbances, such as climate protests. The author argues that crowd reactions, including booing politicians, are a legitimate form of democratic expression and that sanitizing the broadcast strips the event of its authentic character. The USTA's move is seen as a capitulation that sacrifices credibility to shield a political figure from public disapproval.</p>

What started as a simple website created with a friend, Justas Janauskas, to sell her unwanted items quickly grew by word-of-mouth. The platform expanded internationally, overcame a disastrous business decision to add commission fees, and eventually, under new leadership, grew into Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup valued at over a billion dollars.

          <p>Erik Prince, the founder of the defunct private military company Blackwater and a known MAGA supporter, is reportedly attempting to enter Ukraine's defense market. According to sources, Prince has been actively pitching his services and looking to acquire Ukrainian drone companies, which are considered strategic national assets. This move coincides with the Trump administration considering the use of private contractors in a potential postwar scenario in Ukraine. Prince has a history of seeking business opportunities in conflict zones, and his interest in Ukraine's advanced drone sector reflects the changing nature of modern warfare and the private military industry.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued a statement encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, following a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious readings. This stance is contrasted with his office's actions in 2017, when it raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Frisco high school, suggesting it was exclusionary. Critics accuse Paxton of promoting a specific brand of Christian nationalism and violating the constitutional separation of church and state by endorsing one faith over others. The move is seen as part of a broader effort by some Texas Republicans to embed conservative Christian values into public education.</p>

          <p>William Pulte, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), is facing scrutiny for his direct involvement in a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Former officials and housing finance experts describe this action as highly unusual and "bizarre," noting that such investigations are typically handled independently by the agency's Office of Inspector General. The move has raised concerns of political motivation, as Trump has sought to fire Cook and the referral targets a high-profile appointee from the previous administration. Critics argue the process bypasses normal protocols and weaponizes the agency against political opponents.</p>

After being eradicated from the U.S. in the 1960s using a sterile insect technique, the parasitic fly has resurged through Central America and Mexico, threatening the multi-billion dollar American livestock industry. The flies lay eggs in open wounds of warm-blooded animals, and the larvae eat living flesh, which can be devastating to cattle herds. In response, the USDA is investing millions to build new sterile fly production facilities to reinforce the biological barrier that has protected the U.S. for decades.</p>

Burnham suggested the contest is an opportunity to discuss the party's internal management and advocated for a leader from the north of England to counter a "London centricity."

          <p>This opinion column draws parallels between President Trump's second-term economic policies and the statist, populist approach of Argentina's Juan Perón. The author argues that Trump's use of high tariffs for import substitution, direct government intervention in private companies (including taking equity stakes), and challenges to the central bank's independence mirror Peronist strategies. The piece highlights the centralization of economic decision-making in the presidency, where personal relationships and political favoritism dictate outcomes. The author warns that this approach erodes market capitalism and risks creating entrenched interests that could make reversing course difficult, potentially leading the U.S. down a path of economic dysfunction.
