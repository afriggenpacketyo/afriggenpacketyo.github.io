          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended a remembrance service marking the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, which signified the end of World War Two. The event, held at the National Memorial Arboretum, honored the courage and sacrifice of veterans who served in the Far East and Pacific, with 33 surviving veterans as guests of honor. In a message, the King acknowledged the immense suffering of the war, including that of prisoners of war and the victims of the atomic bombings, while celebrating the ultimate victory of liberty. The service included moving accounts from veterans, a two-minute silence, and a military flypast.</p>

          <p>The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program, which allows government and non-profit employees to retroactively make payments for periods of forbearance to qualify for debt cancellation, is experiencing significant delays. As of July, a backlog of 72,730 applications is pending with the Department of Education, an increase from previous months, leaving many borrowers waiting for six months or more. The program gained popularity after the SAVE plan was blocked, which put many PSLF-eligible borrowers into a forbearance that paused their progress toward forgiveness. Despite the delays, consumer advocates still encourage eligible borrowers to apply while also exploring other repayment options.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted by a federal grand jury on corruption charges, making her the first mayor in the city's history to be federally charged while in office. The indictment alleges she conspired with her former bodyguard, with whom she was purportedly having a romantic relationship, to use city funds for personal travel and a city-owned apartment. Cantrell and the bodyguard are accused of wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal agents, allegedly costing the city over $70,000. This indictment follows a separate federal investigation into the mayor's administration that began in 2022.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of posts where Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge issued the default judgment after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described it as a frivolous attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

The Category 1 storm is currently projected to move west-northwest before curving northward, passing near the northern Leeward Islands but remaining offshore of the U.S. East Coast. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are urging Caribbean islands to monitor the storm, warning of heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Erin is expected to intensify into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 4 strength early next week as it travels over warm Atlantic waters.</p>

The move comes after a recent earnings report failed to assure investors of a turnaround, despite the stock's recent surge from near-delisting prices. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, had publicly called for her departure. In her announcement, Wheeler stated that stepping down would allow the company to focus on its future without the distraction of "intense outside interest." The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO.</p>

Playboy plans to establish its new base in a luxury office building and open a new Playboy Club, restaurant, and multimedia studios. Miami Beach officials have welcomed the move, which represents a strategic return for the brand to South Florida, where it previously operated a club and hotel.</p>

The display of military hardware included the same type of long-range bomber used in a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites in June. The B-2 bomber is a symbol of American military power, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear munitions on global missions.

          <p>A parenting self-help book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was due back. The book, checked out in July 1943, was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings. It was likely borrowed by their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for work at the U.S. Embassy shortly after checking it out. The book was returned with a letter hoping there would be no late fee, which the library confirmed, as it eliminated late fees in 2021.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling hundreds of flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could begin this weekend. The airline issued a lockout notice after the union, which is demanding better wages and working conditions, issued a 72-hour strike notice. The carrier has begun a gradual suspension of its operations, which is expected to affect over 100,000 customers and ground its entire fleet by Saturday morning. Contract negotiations have reached an impasse, with the union rejecting the airline's proposal to enter binding arbitration, creating widespread travel disruption.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is pitching a barebones, American-made electric pickup truck that it claims can sell for about half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs by offering a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate has already received over 100,000 reservations, banking on price as its main appeal. However, the expiration of federal EV tax credits may raise the truck's price, placing it in a more competitive market segment.</p>

          <p>PBS has approved a 21% budget cut after Congress recently passed legislation that stripped approximately $1 billion in funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which supports public media. The CPB has announced it will begin winding down its operations as a result. In addition to its own budget reduction, PBS will also lower the dues it collects from its 350 member stations to help them cope with the financial strain. Some local stations, particularly in New Jersey and California, have already begun downsizing staff, with leaders warning the cuts will be devastating for smaller and rural broadcasters.</p>

          <p>Activist hedge fund Starboard Value has increased its stake in Salesforce by 47%, sparking a 4% rally in the company's stock and speculation that a new round of investor activism is imminent. Starboard led a successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed Salesforce to focus on profitability, resulting in a significant stock price increase. Analysts believe Starboard's renewed interest signals mounting pressure on management to improve growth in its core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions. The move comes as Salesforce's stock has struggled this year amid concerns about its AI strategy and a controversial acquisition plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the movement against Atlanta's police training center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment for two and a half years. The defense argued that the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as "the process is the punishment." This marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including Rico conspiracy indictments, from the state.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that about one in ten children on Medicaid who visit an emergency department for a mental health crisis end up "boarding" there for three days or longer while waiting for an inpatient bed. The research, published in JAMA Health Forum, found that depressive disorders and suicidal ideation were the most common reasons for these extended stays. Experts attribute the problem to a nationwide shortage of pediatric psychiatric inpatient beds and a lack of adequate outpatient mental health services to prevent crises. This prolonged waiting in an ER setting can worsen a child's condition.</p>

The agency stated the task force will provide recommendations on vaccines that have "fewer and less serious adverse reactions."

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns about its long-term financial stability are growing. The program, which provides benefits to nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to see its trust funds depleted by 2034 due to outgoings outpacing income, which could lead to a 23% cut in benefits if no action is taken. Potential fixes include raising the cap on income subject to payroll taxes or increasing the retirement age. The program also faces operational challenges following recent staffing cuts by the Trump administration, leading to declining public confidence in its future. (not investment advice)</p>

The legal challenge seeks a temporary restraining order to pause a directive from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that installed a federal official as the head of the D.C. police.

Conversely, states like Mississippi and West Virginia are projected to see the smallest benefits. The analysis also notes that resort counties like Teton County, Wyoming, could see disproportionately high average tax cuts, skewed by top earners, while a separate Congressional Budget Office report warns the bill could hurt lower-income households.
