          <p>Manchester United is exploring a last-minute deal for Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, ahead of the transfer deadline. The club has been seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and was also in talks with Royal Antwerp for the younger Senne Lammens. However, Martinez's extensive Premier League and international experience presents a more seasoned option compared to Lammens. The potential move comes after United's head coach acknowledged the current difficulties of the goalkeeping position at the club.</p>

          <p>Recently released footage shows the suburban Minneapolis house where Robin Westman, who identified as a trans woman, allegedly planned a deadly attack on Annunciation School. Neighbors reported that Westman had moved in recently after a breakup, and a Ring camera captured Westman's van outside the home the day before the shooting. Investigators seized tactical gear and documents from the property, though the weapons shown in a disturbing video Westman posted appear to have been recorded inside the rental. The attack resulted in the deaths of two children and the shooter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough in the UK this year, involving an infant whose mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy. This death highlights growing concerns over declining vaccination rates, with none of the main childhood vaccines reaching the 95% uptake target in England last year. Health officials are re-emphasizing the importance of the maternal whooping cough vaccine, which provides crucial passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their first jab at eight weeks old. This tragic event serves as a stark reminder of the infection's severity in very young babies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity, fueled by social media trends highlighting its health benefits and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has turned matcha into a high-demand commodity. This has led to significant price increases and supply shortages, even in Japan, its country of origin. Japanese tea producers are struggling to keep up, as cultivating the specific tea leaves for matcha is labor-intensive, and aging farming communities face production bottlenecks. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies, and major companies like Ito En are raising prices to manage soaring raw material costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 06:01:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. New data reveals that over half of the students who missed school during the first week of the 2024 academic year became "persistently absent," a rate far higher than for those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels, prompting the government to launch initiatives like attendance and behaviour hubs. Officials stress that consistent attendance is vital for children's future life chances.</p>

          <p>The administration of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is ordering the removal of hundreds of "non-standard" painted crosswalks, including rainbow-themed ones and student-designed safety art. The state claims the move is to keep transportation facilities free of "political ideologies" and cites safety concerns, despite research suggesting such art improves driver behavior. This action has been criticized by local officials as a politically motivated attack, particularly on the LGBTQ+ community, and several municipalities are vowing to fight the directive. The purge also affects school safety programs previously praised by the state's own transportation department.</p>

          <p>In a notable collaboration, Beijing-based CAS Space successfully launched two small satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup from Tijuana. The mission, which placed two "femtosatellites" weighing less than 100 grams each into orbit, marks a significant entry for China into the North American commercial launch market. ThumbSat aims to demonstrate that small satellites can be meaningful and plans to establish low-cost receiving stations across Mexico for educational and amateur use. CAS Space highlighted the launch as a step forward in expanding China's international space cooperation, balancing cost and reliability.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Trump administration's decision to restore a Confederate memorial at Arlington National Cemetery and other Confederate symbols. The author, a U.S. Army veteran, argues that honoring those who fought against the United States is a profound disrespect to the military members who died defending it. Drawing a personal parallel to his grandfather who fought for Mussolini's army, he contends that one can mourn ancestors without glorifying their unjust causes. The article asserts that such memorials, particularly the one at Arlington, go beyond solemn remembrance and actively praise a treasonous rebellion built on slavery.</p>

While the U.S. states the naval presence is for counter-narcotics operations, many Venezuelans are weary of the political turmoil and struggle to maintain daily life amid the crisis.

          <p>This opinion article reflects on Toni Morrison's 1995 speech at Howard University, where she described the creeping steps of fascism and linked it to America's history of racism. The author argues that Morrison's genealogical approach, tracing fascism's roots in American slavery rather than just making political analogies to European history, provides a crucial lens for understanding current political threats. The article posits that Black history offers a powerful model for combating authoritarianism through persistent belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of resistance, and unwavering faith. It concludes that these historical struggles provide a blueprint for defending democracy today.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the rugged underwater topography of the Paracel Islands could be used to create a "submarine kill zone." The concept involves placing intelligent sea mines in "acoustic shadow zones"—areas around seamounts where sonar is ineffective—to hide them from detection. According to the research from the PLA Dalian Naval Academy and Harbin Engineering University, this strategy could enhance the concealment of underwater weapons. The researchers state that strategically placing assets in these sonar dead zones is crucial for enhancing maritime security in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made for her well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, the 32-year-old felt she was on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown. Bright realized she could not give 100% and prioritized her own health over playing in the tournament, a choice she is proud of. Following knee surgery and counseling over the summer, she now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new Women's Super League season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists with the USDA are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent them from attacking livestock in Northern California and Oregon. The drones are equipped with thermal cameras and loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices to scare the predators away. This nonlethal method aims to reduce wolf-rancher conflicts as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results show the novel tactic can successfully interrupt wolf hunts.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Reform UK's Ban on Local Press Mirrors Trump's Anti-Media Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:00:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Reform-led Nottinghamshire council's decision to ban the Nottingham Post newspaper is an importation of Donald Trump's anti-press tactics into UK local politics. The author draws parallels between this ban and the Trump White House's restrictions on journalists from outlets like the Associated Press. The article suggests this is part of a broader hard-right strategy to bypass traditional media, create a foil for political gain, and avoid scrutiny. While noting that press-bashing has had limited long-term success for some UK politicians, the move is seen as a worrying attack on local democracy.</p>

          <p>Leaders from across Asia and beyond, including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have gathered in Tianjin, China for the largest-ever Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Chinese President Xi Jinping has held several bilateral meetings, elevating ties with Armenia to a "strategic partnership" and reinforcing a strong relationship with Azerbaijan. The summit is seen as a key platform for Beijing to project itself as a leader of the Global South and an alternative to Western-led alliances, particularly amid ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States.

          <p>UCLA's football season began with a dispiriting 43-10 defeat against Utah at the Rose Bowl, revealing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The defense struggled with missed tackles and failed to contain Utah's quarterback, Devon Dampier, allowing the Utes to convert 14 of 17 third downs. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a difficult debut, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided loss was a significant setback for coach DeShaun Foster's program, which had kept its preseason preparations largely secret from the media and public.</p>
