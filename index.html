        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a major Category 4 hurricane, posing a catastrophic threat to parts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Expected to reach major hurricane status by Sunday, it could bring 15-25 inches of rain, leading to widespread, life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides across the affected regions. The storm's extremely slow movement increases its potential for significant strengthening and a multi-day impact, potentially making it the strongest hurricane to hit Jamaica in over 35 years since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988. An elderly man in Haiti has already tragically died due to a downed tree.</p>

          <p>The House Committee on Commerce has formally requested information and a briefing from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver regarding an FBI investigation into gambling and game-fixing. The scandal has implicated three current and former players, including Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier, who allegedly disclosed non-public information for betting purposes. Congress seeks details on fraudulent practices, NBA's actions to prevent illegal information disclosure, effectiveness of the Code of Conduct, regulatory gaps, and reevaluation of partnerships with sports betting companies.

          <p>President Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao, former Binance CEO convicted of anti-money laundering violations, is raising questions about political influence and personal gain. Zhao's company, Binance, reportedly helped create code for a stablecoin used by World Liberty Financial, co-founded by Trump's sons, which saw its value surge after an Emirati firm's investment. Critics suggest the pardon, following Zhao's lobbying efforts and legal team connections to Trump's business interests, exemplifies the President using clemency for political overtures and financial remuneration. This article highlights a pattern of pardons benefiting Trump-affiliated groups or those making significant financial contributions.</p>

          <p>Queen Sirikit, the revered mother of Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn and the consort of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej for over six decades, has passed away peacefully at 93 in a Bangkok hospital. She had been receiving medical care since 2019 for various illnesses, including a blood infection earlier this month. Known as a unifying maternal figure for the nation, her birthday is observed as Mother's Day, reflecting her significant cultural impact. The former queen, who suffered a stroke in 2012 and was rarely seen publicly thereafter, was celebrated for her global travels and dedication to her people.</p>

          <p>West Ham's Premier League campaign is in a "perilous" state, marking their worst start to a season in 52 years after a defeat at Leeds. New manager Nuno Espirito Santo remains winless, with the team securing only four points this season, placing them 19th in the table. The club's significant defensive vulnerabilities, having conceded 20 goals, including nine from corners, are highlighted as a major concern. Experts question the manager's tactical decisions, emphasizing the urgent need for change in attitude and commitment to avoid relegation, as previous teams on similar runs have fallen out of the Premier League.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves not to reduce the tax-free allowance for Cash ISAs in the upcoming Budget, arguing it would not effectively promote an investment culture. While the Chancellor reportedly considered reducing the allowance to £10,000 to encourage stock and shares investments, these plans faced strong opposition from banks and consumer campaigners. With a £22bn budget shortfall, Reeves is under pressure to raise taxes or cut spending. The article highlights that Cash ISAs are widely used, holding £360bn, and cutting the limit is unlikely to shift savings into riskier investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing debate surrounds whether learning to drive a manual car remains an essential skill, as automatics now constitute one-third of UK cars, driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel sales. Many young drivers face a dilemma, with automatic lessons often being more expensive or less available, despite a lower pass rate for automatic tests. While a manual license offers flexibility, some argue its necessity diminishes with the shift to electric vehicles.

          <p>President Trump has sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his family, and foreign minister, and suspended aid to Colombia, escalating a feud after Petro accused the US of "murdering" an innocent fisherman in its anti-drug strikes. These US strikes, which have killed at least 43 people, are part of a broader campaign against drug cartels, framed by the Trump administration as a "noninternational armed conflict." The article highlights concerns about the legality and constitutionality of these attacks, and the use of sanctions as a tool of presidential pique, questioning the administration's justification for deadly force.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing for a new, privately-funded ballroom has sparked concerns about President Trump's disregard for constitutional norms and public accountability. This Atlantic article draws parallels to historical changes of the White House, arguing that while the building has evolved, Trump's project proceeds without public notice or congressional approval, unlike past restorations. The article criticizes the project's scale and funding model, viewing it as a symbol of the President's challenge to Congress's power and an indifference to the building's historical and symbolic significance as a public institution, undermining republican ideals.</p>

          <p>The US is significantly escalating its military presence in the Caribbean, deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, leading to concerns about preparations for war with Venezuela. Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of Southern Command, reportedly resigned over the ongoing "counter-narcotic" strikes that have killed 43 people, questioning their legality. This article highlights that the massive military deployment, including the USS Gerald R. Ford, provides firepower beyond anti-drug operations, suggesting potential air strikes inside Venezuela. Critics argue this is a regime-change operation, with experts warning of a potentially bloody outcome and questioning the administration's constitutional authority.</p>

          <p>China's STEM education system is facing significant criticism for its outdated curricula and emphasis on theory over practical experience, potentially hindering the nation's talent development. Robotics guru Wang Xingxing highlighted that university knowledge is often 20 years behind cutting-edge technologies, creating a stark gap compared to overseas education. This article argues that despite China's challenge to Western dominance in critical sectors, its current STEM training may not be adequately preparing students for the demands of the "fourth industrial revolution."

          <p>A lawyer for Byron Black, a man executed on Tennessee's death row, has alleged that an electrocardiogram showed his heart remained active for nearly two minutes after he was pronounced dead. This claim intensifies scrutiny on Tennessee's lethal injection protocols, which were already questioned after witnesses reported Black showed visible distress and pain during the August execution. The EKG evidence, which stopped before a flatline was recorded, suggests the sedative pentobarbital may not have worked as intended. This article highlights concerns about potential "torture," protocol violations, and the lack of transparency in the execution process, calling into question state officials' understanding of the drug.</p>

This Atlantic article argues that Trump's refusal to spend appropriated funds and his efforts to raise revenues without congressional approval, such as through private donations for a ballroom or tariffs, undermine the legislature's role. It posits that the shutdown is less about specific grievances and more about a fundamental rejection of constitutional limits by the President, with his allies in Congress reinforcing this by sidelining legislative work.</p>
