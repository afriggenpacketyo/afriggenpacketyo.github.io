While the disciplinary panel found the search unjustified and degrading, it concluded that race was not a factor, a finding that contrasts with a previous safeguarding report that suggested racism was likely involved.</p>

          <p>Top Trump administration officials, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have launched a coordinated effort to defend the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Hegseth described the operation as "historically successful," pushing back against preliminary intelligence assessments that suggested a more limited impact. Despite the administration's claims that the facilities were "obliterated," key questions remain unanswered, including whether Iran successfully moved enriched uranium before the attack.</p>

          <p>Recent research from Apple, Salesforce, and other labs is casting doubt on the capabilities of advanced AI reasoning models, a key driver of the recent tech boom. A paper from Apple researchers suggests these models fail on complex problems and may be memorizing patterns rather than genuinely problem-solving, a phenomenon some call "jagged intelligence." This raises questions about the long-term trajectory of AI development and the massive investments being made in companies like Nvidia, although some experts suggest Apple's findings may be motivated by its need to catch up in the AI race.

At a special event in Paris, she clocked a time of 4:06.42, which will not be an official record due to assistance from pacemakers and advanced equipment. Despite falling short, Kipyegon, who holds the official world record at 4:07.64, expressed that she has not lost hope and believes the barrier will eventually be broken.</p>

The article argues that by demanding officials parrot his claims that Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," President Trump is prioritizing loyalty over factual assessment. This approach, it suggests, undermines the credibility of U.S. intelligence and shuts down the proper, skeptical analysis required for critical international security issues.</p>
