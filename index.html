        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside over £60 million for a compensation scheme for alleged victims of its late former owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. Over 100 former employees are expected to file claims related to historical abuse, including multiple accusations of sexual assault that have been under investigation. This redress program, open until March 2026, offers significant compensation to eligible claimants, though it requires them to waive rights to further legal action. The financial provision for this scheme has notably contributed to Harrods reporting a substantial loss in its latest annual accounts.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack targeted a railway station in Shostka, a city in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, injuring at least 30 people, including children. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike as an act of terrorism, stating that train staff and passengers were among the casualties and that Russia must have known it was targeting civilians. The attack hit two trains, with the second strike occurring during evacuations, further highlighting the deliberate nature of the assault. This incident is part of a recent escalation in Russian aerial attacks, prompting renewed calls from Ukraine for more advanced air defense systems from its Western allies.</p>

          <p>Days of violent protests in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have concluded after a civil rights alliance reached an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 fatalities, were organized to demand lower prices for wheat and electricity and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands and pledged to improve public services. Following the announcement, the alliance's leader called for the demonstrators to disperse, expressing hope that the agreement will be implemented successfully.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police has significantly increased its street presence with hundreds of extra officers to reassure communities following a deadly attack at a synagogue. The incident involved an attacker driving a car into people, killing two men, before being shot dead by police. In the aftermath, authorities are managing heightened tensions, particularly with a pro-Palestine march scheduled in the city, which officials have questioned as inappropriate given the circumstances. Six individuals remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses related to the attack as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has thrown the national park system into a state of confusion and partial closure, furloughing thousands of employees. While some parks remain partially accessible, critical services like maintenance and visitor support are suspended, leading to visitor frustration and safety concerns. This situation echoes the 2018 shutdown, which resulted in environmental damage and sanitation issues at popular sites like Joshua Tree.

          <p>Small college towns across the United States are facing economic hardship due to a significant drop in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities like Miami University in Ohio have seen their international student populations plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $140 million and impacting local businesses that rely on them. The decline is attributed to factors including stricter visa screening processes, fears of deportation among students, and lingering effects from the pandemic. This trend threatens the financial stability of smaller schools and the cultural diversity of their communities.</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British man who was recently released from a Dubai prison, has died following a car crash during a police chase in London. Last year, Fakana was sentenced to a year in prison in Dubai for a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl but received a royal pardon in July. Just three months after regaining his freedom, he was a passenger in a vehicle that crashed after a brief police pursuit in Tottenham. His lawyer stated that the time in a Dubai prison had caused him significant mental anguish and that he was looking forward to building a positive future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve signaling the start of an easing cycle by cutting its benchmark interest rate, savers may see lower returns on traditional savings accounts. Financial experts suggest that Americans looking for better yields on their cash should consider alternatives like Certificates of Deposit (CDs), which can lock in current rates for a set term. Other recommended options include U.S. Treasury bills, which offer competitive yields and are exempt from state and local taxes, and money market funds that provide liquidity and safety. These instruments can help savers preserve their purchasing power as interest rates are expected to continue declining. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party, now in opposition, is grappling with historically low popularity and an internal struggle for direction under leader Kemi Badenoch. As the party gathers for its annual conference, it faces the challenge of demonstrating its relevance to voters while being squeezed by the Labour government and the ascendant Reform UK party. Many Conservatives privately express doubts about Badenoch's leadership, criticizing a lack of pace and public traction since she took over. The conference is seen as a critical opportunity for her to define a clear vision and prove that the party can still be a formidable political force.</p>

Her victory over a more moderate candidate signals a shift within the party as it seeks to regain public trust after recent election losses.

          <p>A 37-year-old mother, Michaela Del Barrio, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer after she proactively pushed for early screening due to a family history of the disease. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered after a risk assessment revealed two suspicious masses. Her experience underscores the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare, as her cancer was caught at a stage with a 99% five-year survival rate. Oncologists emphasize that while average-risk women should begin mammograms at 40, those with higher risk factors need a personalized screening plan that may start much earlier.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a decision she credited with making her feel better and aligning with her ethical principles.

Her dietary choices were deeply intertwined with her activism, as she often spoke out against the environmental damage caused by factory farming and meat production.

Schools like Northeastern University have risen in prominence by focusing on distinctive programs like co-ops that offer hands-on work experience. This trend reflects a growing sentiment that a college's worth should be measured by the tangible outcomes it delivers for students rather than its historical brand name alone.</p>

Critics argue the nine-page document is an illegal overreach that would force schools to surrender their autonomy over admissions, hiring, free speech, and curriculum. The compact includes a ban on considering factors like political views in admissions and prohibits university employees from speaking on political events. Legal experts describe the proposal as an ideological shakedown that threatens the tradition of academic freedom that has made American higher education a global leader.</p>

In the 1960s, her observation of chimps making and using tools shattered the existing definitions of what separated humans from other animals. Her patient work, exemplified by the moment she earned the trust of a chimp she named David Greybeard, transformed our understanding of animal intelligence and social structures. Goodall's journey from a secretary to a world-renowned conservationist began a friendship between species that fundamentally changed how we see ourselves in the world.</p>

Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to begin in Egypt, which will serve as a critical test of Hamas's readiness to accept the proposed terms.
