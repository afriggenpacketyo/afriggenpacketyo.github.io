            <p>Deborah Sampson, a woman from Plympton, Massachusetts, disguised herself as a man named Robert Shurtlieff to enlist in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. She served for nearly two years, even taking a bullet in the thigh during a skirmish and bravely removing it herself to maintain her secret. Her true identity was only discovered when she fell ill with a fever, leading to an honorable discharge and later, a military pension with assistance from Paul Revere. Sampson's story is a testament to her courage and determination to serve her country, leading to her recognition as the official heroine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador to advocate for the release of a deportee has sparked controversy, with critics suggesting it may violate the Logan Act, a law prohibiting unauthorized diplomacy. The act, dating back to 1799, forbids U.S. citizens from corresponding with foreign officials to influence disputes with the United States. While some argue Van Hollen's actions mirror those that led to scrutiny of Michael Flynn, others dismiss the Logan Act as a "dead letter," though politically useful to criticize the senator's actions abroad. The American Accountability Foundation has requested the Senate Ethics Committee investigate possible violations.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were attempting to deport individuals without allowing them to argue their case in court, as previously mandated by the Supreme Court. The ACLU filed suit after it was learned that some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas were being accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang and were slated to be deported under the wartime law. The Supreme Court's order prevents the removal of detainees until further notice.</p>

            <p>A recent poll by a teaching union in the UK reveals that social media influencers, particularly Andrew Tate, are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools. Teachers report instances of boys refusing to listen to female teachers and expressing views that women are property. The Department for Education acknowledges the "damaging impact" of such influencers and is providing support to teachers. The NASUWT union is calling for concerted action to protect children from the influence of far-right populists and extremists online.</p>

            <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, admitted to dangerous driving after a police chase resulted in a crash involving five police vehicles and his car, injuring seven officers.

Azarbonyad also admitted to driving without insurance and a license and has shown genuine remorse for his actions. He was granted conditional bail and will be sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court on May 20.</p>

The ministry stated that the measures harm the legitimate rights of Chinese companies, disrupt global supply chains, and violate World Trade Organization rules. The U.S. port fees, finalized by the Trump administration, target vessels owned, operated, or built by Chinese firms, with fees increasing annually until 2028.

            <p>According to experts, early reading proficiency is a strong predictor of long-term success, with children who read well early on more likely to stay in school, secure better jobs, and earn higher incomes. Parents who foster a love for reading from a young age often treat baby babble as conversation, ask numerous questions, and discuss letter sounds rather than just names. They also engage in playful word activities like rhymes and tongue twisters, and seize everyday moments to make reading a part of daily life, creating a foundation for literacy skills.</p>

            <p>Economists are raising concerns about the potential for stagflation, a combination of rising inflation, slower economic growth, and high unemployment. Some experts believe the Trump White House tariff policy has increased the risk of stagflation, leading to uncertainty in consumer confidence. To prepare for stagflation, consumers are advised to pay down high-interest debt, build an emergency fund, and carefully consider major purchases. While higher interest rates provide inflation-beating returns on cash, investors may want to allocate towards equities and riskier assets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The White House's proposal to cancel NASA's Mars sample return program has raised concerns that the US could cede space leadership to China. With China's Tianwen-3 mission set to deliver Martian material to Earth by 2031, the US withdrawal would leave China as the sole player in the race. This decision could prompt NASA's international partners to rethink their cooperation with the US and weaken US leadership in space, especially as China rolls out ambitious space programs.</p>

            <p>Partiful, a party-planning startup popular among Gen Z, is gaining traction as an alternative to traditional event planning methods. The app, known for its humorous and casual designs, allows users to easily create and manage events. After Apple launched its own event-planning service, Partiful posted a joke about "copycats" on its X account. While Partiful faces competition from other event planning services, its Gen Z appeal has contributed to its growing user base and recognition as a leading app in the market.</p>

            <p>The increasing cost of hobbies, dubbed "hobby inflation," is making recreational activities inaccessible to many, especially those in the working and middle classes. Activities like shooting, bourbon collecting, fishing, and golf have seen significant price increases, driven by factors like supply-chain issues and rising raw-material costs. This growing exclusivity can lead to social isolation and a loss of opportunities for people from different backgrounds to connect, as hobbies often create communities that transcend social and cultural differences.</p>

The author recalls seeing Bulls hats worldwide, representing a sense of hope and energy.

The author questions whether people buying Bulls hats are aware of this association, emphasizing that sometimes, a hat is just a hat.</p>

            <p>Two Japanese naval ships docked at Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, which has recently undergone a Chinese-funded upgrade, raising US concerns about its potential use as a Chinese naval outpost. The visit marks the first foreign navy presence since the base's expansion. Japan's growing ties with Cambodia aim to counterbalance China's regional influence, and the invitation for the port call is seen as an attempt to ease Washington's worries. The US has expressed concerns over China's activities at the base, particularly regarding potential military use.</p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that Turkey, under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, poses a growing threat to Israel, potentially leading to unavoidable conflict. Erdoğan's consolidation of power, fusion of Turkish nationalism and Islamism, and anti-Zionist stance are contributing factors. Turkey's military strength and ambitions in the region, particularly in Syria, further exacerbate the danger of a direct Turkish-Israeli conflict. The article suggests that Trump needs to cultivate greater influence in Ankara to reduce the risk of regional war.</p>

            <p>Two political appointees at the Pentagon, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were terminated after being placed on administrative leave pending a leak investigation. The investigation, ordered by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, seeks to identify unauthorized disclosures and involves potential polygraph tests. A third official, Colin Carroll, chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also placed on leave amid the investigation. The memo ordering the investigation was released the same day that the Pentagon denied Elon Musk was coming to the Pentagon for a classified briefing on war plans with China.</p>
