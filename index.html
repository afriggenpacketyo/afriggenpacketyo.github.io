            <p>President Trump revealed that the U.S. and China are actively engaged in discussions regarding a tariff agreement, expressing optimism that a deal could be reached within the next three to four weeks. While Trump remained vague about direct communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he emphasized his strong relationship with Xi and his confidence in securing a deal, regardless of whether a formal agreement is reached. Trump suggested that even without a deal, the U.S. would set specific targets for China, ensuring a favorable outcome for the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ukraine has imposed sanctions on three Chinese companies, escalating tensions after President Zelenskyy accused China of supplying weapons to Russia, a claim Beijing denies. The sanctions will freeze any assets the companies hold in Ukraine and prevent them from conducting business with the country. This move signals a shift from Ukraine's previously neutral stance towards China, particularly after Zelenskyy accused China of obstructing participation in a Swiss peace conference. The situation underscores the delicate balance Ukraine must maintain as it seeks international support in its conflict with Russia.</p>

            <p>A coroner's inquest into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision has prompted a call for stricter eyesight regulations for motorists in the UK. The coroner, Dr. James Adeley, criticized the current system, which relies on self-reporting of visual conditions, as "ineffective and unsafe." The report highlights that the UK is one of the few European countries without mandatory visual checks for drivers up to the age of 70. The Department for Transport has acknowledged the need to reassess the rules and will consider changes as part of its road safety strategy.</p>

The move underscores Trump's close relationship with Israel and his emphasis on Holy Week. Placing notes in the Western Wall is a common practice, with the notes typically collected twice a year.</p>

            <p>Following an attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), residents of Sudan's Zamzam camp, already among the world's most vulnerable, were forced to flee, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods.

Thousands of displaced people are now seeking refuge in the town of Tawila, overwhelming the available resources and medical facilities.

            <p>Nintendo announced that retail preorders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 will begin on April 24, following a delay caused by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The company initially planned to start preorders on April 9 but postponed the date to assess the potential impact of tariffs on electronics manufactured in Asia. Despite the delay, Nintendo confirmed that the Switch 2 will cost $449.99 in the U.S., with the "Mario Kart World" bundle priced at $499.99. The company noted that accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 will experience price adjustments due to the tariffs.</p>

Tommy Wu from Commerzbank believes closer ties between Europe and China, as well as among Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and China, could emerge as a result of the trade tensions. Zhu Feng from Nanjing University argues that Trump's aggressive approach creates a stark contrast between the US and China, potentially benefiting China's global standing. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A mob in Karachi, Pakistan, beat to death a member of the Ahmadiyya minority after hundreds of radical Islamists surrounded their place of worship. The mob, including members of the anti-blasphemy group Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), was enraged by allegations that Ahmadis were offering Friday prayers. The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretics by the Pakistani government, has faced decades of persecution, which has intensified in recent years. The incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by religious minorities in Pakistan, where blasphemy laws are often used to justify violence.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, despite a court order protecting him from deportation.

The senator's visit and the resulting photos are the first public sighting of Ábrego García since his deportation. The White House maintains that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang and therefore ineligible to return to the United States.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>New tariffs, including those on imported cars and parts, are expected to drive up the cost of auto repairs and maintenance, ultimately leading to higher auto insurance rates. While a temporary pause on tariffs has been considered, other tariffs on steel, aluminum, and goods from Canada and Mexico are still affecting the price of car parts. This means that even drivers who don't purchase new cars will likely see their insurance premiums increase. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs makes it difficult to predict the exact impact on insurance rates.</p>

Evers used the veto to extend a per-student revenue increase for K-12 public schools until 2425.
