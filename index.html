          <h2>UK Government Proposes New Law to Preemptively Stop Mass Attackers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 20:07:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law designed to prevent mass casualty events by individuals who are not motivated by a specific ideology. This legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparing attacks, similar to existing counter-terrorism powers. The move comes in response to incidents like the Southport attack, where the perpetrator lacked a clear ideological motive, preventing earlier intervention under current terrorism laws. The new offense would broaden police powers to apprehend individuals fixated on violence before they can act.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway in Portland, Oregon, after four teenagers were stabbed during a large, unsanctioned outdoor rave early Saturday morning. The incident occurred during a disturbance in the crowd, where an individual reportedly used a knife. All four victims were transported to the hospital with injuries ranging from minor to serious. Police have detained one of the injured men pending investigation and are not actively seeking other suspects, but have appealed for witnesses to come forward as many left the scene without speaking to authorities.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian witnesses and hospital officials, at least 32 Palestinians were killed Saturday when Israeli troops opened fire near crowds seeking food from distribution centers in southern Gaza. The incidents occurred near hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group supported by the U.S. and Israel. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after suspects approached troops in a closed area. The event highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the dangers civilians face when attempting to access desperately needed aid.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent. The incident occurred in January during a city-led sweep of a homeless encampment ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The lawsuit alleges that city employees failed to check if the tent was occupied before demolishing it, leading to a "tragic and preventable" death. The family is seeking unspecified damages and calling for more humane treatment of the city's unhoused population.</p>

Trump has denied the report, calling the letter a fake. The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases in the U.S.</p>

At Edinburgh Airport, for example, drivers face a £6 tariff for a brief 10-minute stop. In response, many people are parking in nearby lay-bys and waiting for their passengers to call before quickly driving to unofficial pickup spots. This behavior highlights public frustration with what many perceive as "extortionate" fees for a basic service that is often free at major European airports.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges by water companies in half by the year 2030. This is the first time the government has set a specific reduction target on the issue, which has caused significant public outrage over pollution in rivers and coastlines. The announcement comes after new data showed serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The plan is part of a broader effort to reform the water industry and improve its environmental performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico, citing a violation of a bilateral aviation agreement. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions to shift air traffic from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims unfairly disadvantages American carriers. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The administration also threatened to terminate a long-standing partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico, escalating the trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

While the hitmen are serving life sentences, the man suspected of hiring them, Mohammed Ali Ege, remains one of Europe's most wanted men after escaping custody in India.

          <p>Rory McIlroy produced a thrilling third round at The Open, shooting a 66 to move to eight under par and give himself an outside chance at victory.

Despite a bogey caused by a bizarre incident where his club struck a buried golf ball in the rough, he finished strong. His performance has set up a compelling narrative for the final day's play.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins have persisted in Syria's Suweida Province, despite a ceasefire announced by the interim president. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the past week's violence. The government deployed troops to quell the fighting, but they were accused of siding with the Bedouins. An earlier U.S.-brokered deal, which included a halt to Israeli military strikes in support of the Druze, appears to have failed as gunfire and looting were reported in Suweida city after the announcement.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on stronger security cooperation with its major European partners, France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This shift, marked by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over the future of the U.S. security commitment to Europe under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK could supplement or even eventually replace the U.S. protection for the continent.</p>

The article details cases where individuals with documented psychiatric disorders were deemed fit for service, potentially endangering themselves and their units. While a national health database exists, psychiatric records often require patient consent to be included, creating a loophole. This issue highlights the immense pressure on Ukraine's mobilization system as it struggles to find enough recruits for the ongoing war against Russia.</p>
