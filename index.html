          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended his government's decision to partially suspend arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza, citing humanitarian concerns over potential civilian casualties. Merz emphasized that while Germany's fundamental solidarity with Israel remains unchanged, it does not equate to unconditional support for every Israeli government action. The move has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative bloc and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed Merz "buckled" under pressure, marking a significant shift in German policy amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>During a preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who was not playing, was involved in a bizarre collision with a sideline official. While celebrating a teammate's play, Lamb inadvertently stepped into the restricted area, leading to the official running into him. Neither person was injured in the incident, but the Cowboys received a penalty for sideline interference. The referee later explained that the contact resulted in an automatic foul because Lamb was in an area designated for officials during the game.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators marched through central London, calling for the release of hostages held in Gaza and showing support for the nation. Led by the UK's chief rabbi, protesters carried Israeli flags and placards with hostages' faces, with some expressing anger at the UK government's intention to potentially recognize a Palestinian state. The march was largely peaceful, though police made one arrest for assault and a public order offense. Participants, including family members of those affected by the October 7th attacks, voiced concerns over rising antisemitism and urged the government to prioritize freeing the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is facing turmoil over its drug review protocols, highlighted by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The agency granted the costly $3.2 million treatment an accelerated approval in 2023 despite internal concerns about limited clinical data, a decision initially praised for its flexibility. However, the situation has become a crisis after three patients receiving Sarepta's treatments died from acute liver failure in recent months. This prompted the FDA to suspend the drug's distribution, causing the company's stock to plummet and raising serious questions about the agency's approval standards.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress on the Canyon fire in Ventura County, California, reaching 62% containment as of Sunday morning. The blaze, which started during a heat wave, has held steady at 5,370 acres and destroyed seven structures. Evacuation orders for 2,700 residents have been lifted, although crews remain vigilant due to high temperatures and potential wind gusts. Three firefighters have sustained injuries, including one battalion chief who was seriously hurt when his truck rolled over in steep terrain. Officials are now monitoring the fire and strengthening containment lines, with some of the 1,100 personnel potentially being released for other incidents.</p>

The fire occurred during one of the city's busiest weekends with the Edinburgh festivals underway, sending smoke across the city. This incident follows a series of wildfire warnings issued across Scotland this year due to an unusually warm and dry summer, which has led to widespread water scarcity concerns.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly responded to President Trump's threats to assume federal control over the city's police force. Bowser defended the District's autonomy and highlighted that violent crime has dropped 26% compared to last year, directly countering White House claims of rampant violence. While acknowledging a crime spike in 2023, she called comparisons to a war zone "hyperbolic and false." The mayor expressed concern over a potential deployment of the National Guard and argued that a federal takeover is not a realistic possibility under current law, stating the city needs more federal prosecutors and judges, not a show of force.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have launched a murder inquiry after a man's body was discovered in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Detectives suspect the death may be connected to a separate, brutal assault on a local priest, Fr. John Murray, which occurred earlier the same day. The priest was reportedly attacked with a bottle inside his church and remains in serious condition with a head injury. The local community has been left horrified by the two violent incidents, with political representatives expressing deep sadness for the families affected.</p>

Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, not just on long trail excursions.

          <p>The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to address Israel's plan to expand its military operations and take control of Gaza City. The proposal has drawn widespread international condemnation, with a UN official warning it could trigger "another calamity" and further destabilize the region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the plan as the quickest way to end the war by dismantling remaining Hamas strongholds. The live-updated article also covers related developments, including missile fire from Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the views of Israel's far-right, and a German poll showing majority support for recognizing a Palestinian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to branding expert Goldie Chan, an introvert herself, developing a strong personal brand is a key strategy for career success, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She advises that a personal brand is simply what people know you for professionally and that introverts can use it to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. Chan suggests starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one professional update a week, to build confidence. She emphasizes that branding isn't just online; engaging in hobbies and social groups also helps build connections and opportunities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biographical analysis of novelist Muriel Spark focuses on her identity as a major modern religious writer, a facet often overshadowed by her reputation for comic wit. The article argues that Spark, a Roman Catholic convert, used her narrative structure to explore theological themes, particularly the relationship between an omniscient, capricious God and humanity, often drawing from the Book of Job. Her signature use of prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early in the story, forces readers to focus on causality and divine will rather than suspense. The analysis connects her literary style to her life experiences, including her work in wartime psychological operations.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have strongly dismissed claims in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. In her book, Sturgeon denies she was the source of the leak but suggests it would have been a "classic Alex" move. Salmond's supporters, including Alba party leader Kenny MacAskill, labeled the suggestion a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy," reigniting the bitter feud that fractured the Scottish National Party and the independence movement. Salmond was acquitted of all sexual offense charges following a trial in 2020.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced without their consultation or credit. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who stated her government was exploring legal options to support the affected communities. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the footwear have since been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>President Trump has invited Vladimir Putin to meet in Alaska, a high-stakes diplomatic move aimed at fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting was orchestrated through back-channel talks led by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, after the president grew frustrated with Putin's lack of commitment to peace. While Trump hopes to broker a deal, European allies and Ukraine worry he might concede to Russian demands, such as redrawing borders, without their consent. The summit represents a significant gamble, as Trump believes his personal negotiating skills can succeed where traditional diplomacy has failed, despite Putin's history of aggression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are warning individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements, despite their perceived health benefits for issues like inflammation or acid reflux. The active compound in licorice, glycyrrhizin, can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance puts significant strain on the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including arrhythmias. The FDA has also cautioned that consuming as little as two ounces of black licorice daily for two weeks can cause significant cardiovascular problems. Patients are advised to consult their doctor before taking any new supplements.</p>

In Lincoln, the storm damaged two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, forcing the displacement of 387 inmates, though no injuries were reported among staff or prisoners.

Jason described the decision as a non-negotiable opportunity to create lasting memories while his parents are still in good health. The career break has been transformative, allowing them to focus on health, re-evaluate career priorities, and realize they can live happily on less, prompting a shift away from chasing higher salaries upon their return.</p>

They also addressed President Trump's call for a new census before 2030 to facilitate the redrawing of districts. Dr. Phil acknowledged that while both parties engage in gerrymandering, the current situation represents an extreme and contentious example of the practice.</p>
