          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a dip below 140 yen, a level not seen since last September, following President Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not implementing interest rate cuts. Trump's remarks, made via social media, expressed the need for "preemptive cuts" to bolster the economy, leading to concerns about the central bank's independence. Tokyo stocks ended with mixed results, while gold prices reached an all-time high due to investors seeking safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft, including flipping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a lottery system for non-playoff teams, waiving the eligibility rule to allow younger players to be drafted but stashed, and using a salary pool to give players more control over their destination. These proposals aim to address concerns about top prospects landing on struggling teams and to increase parity in the league. Each system presents potential drawbacks, but they are presented as ways to hand some agency to players over their careers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US State Department has reportedly advised allies to avoid using Chinese satellite services, citing concerns that these services could be exploited by Beijing for military intelligence gathering. The memo urges countries to exclude Chinese satellite providers from their markets to safeguard national security, business secrets, and citizens' privacy. It suggests that reliance on Chinese space providers could advance Beijing's foreign policy objectives and lead to the transfer of sensitive information to the Chinese government, potentially creating a monopolistic, Beijing-controlled market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 03:56:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines how climate change-driven disasters and rising sea levels are intensifying the global housing crisis, particularly in vulnerable regions. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, they erode available housing stock, drive up insurance costs, and lead to 'climate gentrification,' where wealthier individuals move to higher-elevation areas, displacing low-income residents. City planning and risk reduction strategies, such as shifting housing density towards low-risk areas and retrofitting existing structures, are suggested as potential solutions to ensure affordability and climate resilience.</p>

The move comes as President Trump has threatened to end the pharmaceutical industry's exemption from import tariffs, prompting other companies like Novartis and AstraZeneca to make similar investments in the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>India and the US have expressed optimism about ongoing bilateral trade negotiations following a meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Vice-President Vance. Both countries aim to finalize a trade deal before the expiry of a 90-day pause on higher tariffs imposed by President Trump. Despite a warm personal relationship between Modi and Trump, the US has repeatedly criticized India's high tariffs. The leaders also discussed cooperation in defense, strategic technologies, and energy, with Trump expected to attend the Quad summit in Delhi later this year.</p>

          <p>Thailand's negotiations with the United States on trade tariffs have been postponed at Washington's request for Bangkok to review important issues. Thailand is facing a 36% tariff if a reduction cannot be negotiated before a global moratorium expires in July. The Prime Minister stated that Thailand is reviewing issues, including tariffs that may be adjusted appropriately, and is consulting with academics and all parties to protect agricultural interests as much as possible.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss trade, reporting significant progress towards a trade deal. The meeting is crucial as India seeks to finalize an agreement before the expiry of a 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Vance's visit is also an opportunity for India to potentially host Trump later this year for the Quad summit. The leaders also discussed enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, and strategic technologies.</p>
