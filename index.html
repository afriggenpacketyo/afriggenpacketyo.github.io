          <p>Federal authorities conducted raids on the home and office of John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor under Donald Trump, as part of an investigation into the potential possession of classified documents. The action highlights the deeply fractured relationship between the two figures, which evolved from mutual praise to public animosity. Trump commented on the raid, calling Bolton a "lowlife" and questioning his patriotism, continuing a long-running feud that began with policy disagreements during their time in the White House. This article traces their history from Bolton's initial consideration for Secretary of State to his contentious departure and the ensuing years of public conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will not legally defend a federal grant program for colleges with large Hispanic student populations, arguing it is unconstitutional. In a memo to Congress, the Justice Department stated that the program, which requires at least 25% Hispanic undergraduate enrollment for eligibility, provides an unfair advantage based on ethnicity. This decision aligns the administration with a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the department contends the program constitutes "patently unconstitutional" racial balancing, leaving the program's defense to an association of Hispanic-serving universities.</p>

          <p>In newly released transcripts of a prison interview, Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has denied the existence of a 'client list' and stated she never witnessed inappropriate behavior by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton. Speaking to officials, Maxwell also called allegations against Prince Andrew "mind-blowingly not conceivable" and claimed a widely circulated photograph of the prince with accuser Virginia Giuffre was fake. The 300-page transcript reveals Maxwell's perspective on her relationship with Epstein, his high-profile associates, and her belief that his death was not a suicide. The interview was conducted as Maxwell seeks a presidential pardon while serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Despite not being the newest or most powerful missiles in its arsenal, China's DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a cornerstone of its nuclear deterrent strategy. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated the PLA Rocket Force's ability to deliver a credible second-strike nuclear counterattack, capable of reaching the United States mainland. The DF-31AG variant, activated during the test, showcases China's continued reliance on this established platform to project strategic power. The article emphasizes that the missile's effectiveness provides China with significant geopolitical leverage and reinforces its national security posture against potential adversaries.</p>

The recognition highlights a significant moment for diversity and representation at one of the world's most renowned comedy festivals.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident occurred in western New York when a tour bus carrying 54 people lost control and rolled over on the New York State Thruway, resulting in the deaths of five passengers. The bus was returning to New York City from Niagara Falls when the incident happened near Pembroke. According to state police, the vehicle veered into the median, over-corrected, and ended up in a ditch without striking any other vehicles. While the cause is still under investigation, mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out. Dozens of other passengers sustained injuries, with several in critical condition at various regional hospitals.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruptive activity, shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet high within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st such event since December, with the eruption currently contained and posing no threat to nearby homes. The spectacle is drawing visitors to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, offering a dramatic display of nature's power. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma buildup in a lower chamber forces molten rock to the surface, creating the impressive lava fountains that have become a recurring feature of this ongoing eruption.</p>

          <p>Multiple national postal services across Europe and India have announced the immediate suspension of most merchandise shipments to the United States due to uncertainty surrounding new import tariffs signed by President Donald Trump.

Postal operators in Germany, Sweden, Italy, and India, among others, stated they cannot guarantee packages will arrive before the deadline and cited a lack of clarity on implementation.

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza from Israeli strikes and gunfire, including displaced people in tents and individuals seeking aid. This comes as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global authority, officially declared that famine is gripping Gaza City. The announcement has amplified international calls for Israel to halt its offensive and allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged territory. Israel has denounced the famine report as a lie while continuing preparations for a large-scale operation in Gaza City.

The band posted on social media that this was the first time such an action had been taken against them in six years. However, festival organizers denied this account, stating that the sound was cut only after the band used a chant "widely understood to have a discriminatory context." Video from the event shows a stagehand removing the flag, followed by the band's banjo player leading a "Free Palestine" chant before his microphone was muted, prompting the band to leave the stage.</p>

The legislation, which aims to redraw the state's congressional map to create five new GOP-leaning districts, passed after a heated debate and a weeks-long standoff in the House where Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum. The mid-decade redistricting effort was encouraged by President Trump to help Republicans secure their House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a counter-plan to redraw his state's map to favor Democrats, escalating a national battle over political boundaries.</p>

The parole boards cited the brothers' behavior in prison, rather than the original crime, as the primary reason for the denials. Erik Menendez, 54, was noted for involvement in fights, drug use, and possessing contraband, with a commissioner stating he was not a "model prisoner." Lyle Menendez, 57, was also cited for rule-breaking, including a recent mobile phone violation, which the board said indicated ongoing anti-social traits despite his expressed remorse. Both brothers maintained they acted in self-defense against parental abuse.</p>

Despite Roblox's claims of having a 24/7 moderation system and taking swift action, inappropriate content remains prevalent, leading to numerous lawsuits and a child protection investigation by Louisiana's Attorney General.

          <p>The landscape of college athletics is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from its amateur roots toward a more professionalized model. Recent court decisions allowing athletes to be paid have accelerated this shift, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and men's basketball. This evolution raises critical questions about the future of non-revenue generating sports, such as squash and water polo, which may face elimination as resources are redirected. Furthermore, the article highlights existing inequities, noting that college sports have historically functioned as a form of affirmative action for affluent white students, who are often admitted with lower academic standards and comprise a majority of athletes in Ivy League institutions.</p>

Despite witnessing the destruction firsthand, the participants largely clung to their conspiracy theories, suggesting the scenes were faked for Ukrainian propaganda.

          <p>As older generations prepare to pass down an estimated $25 trillion in real estate, wealth advisors are highlighting strategies to minimize family conflict and tax burdens. Experts recommend transferring property through a will or trust upon death, rather than as a lifetime gift, to allow heirs to benefit from a "step-up in basis" that reduces capital gains taxes. To protect the asset from lawsuits and disputes, placing the home in a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is advised, with an operating agreement that outlines rules for usage, expenses, and potential buyouts. Setting aside liquid assets or a life insurance policy to cover maintenance costs is also crucial to prevent financial strain on the inheriting generation. (not investment advice)</p>

This 'MAHA-washing' can create a misleading health halo, encouraging consumers to eat more junk food under the false belief that it is healthier.

          <p>Some businesses are reviving "recession specials," a marketing tactic from the 2008 financial crisis, in response to growing economic anxiety and deteriorating consumer sentiment. Establishments from New York coffee shops to San Francisco burger chains are offering discounted deals that explicitly reference a potential recession, tapping into public concerns over inflation and a slowing economy. This trend reflects broader economic data, such as the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which has fallen amid concerns over trade policy and expectations of weakening labor markets. The specials indicate that businesses are anticipating a pullback in consumer spending as households brace for a potential downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes, Florida is rethinking how it builds and rebuilds its communities. Following the devastation of Hurricane Ian, some residents are moving inland to master-planned towns like Babcock Ranch, which was designed with storm-proof features and survived the storm with minimal damage. In other areas, particularly lower-income neighborhoods, nonprofits and city programs are helping residents fortify or replace their old homes with elevated, hurricane-resistant structures. These efforts highlight a growing recognition of the need for proactive mitigation, though they face challenges from the high cost of retrofitting and declining federal support for such measures under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Public schools across El Salvador have begun enforcing stringent new disciplinary rules, including mandatory military-style haircuts for boys and strict uniform inspections. The order, issued by the new Education Minister Karla Trigueros, a high-ranking military officer, is defended by President Nayib Bukele's government as a necessary step to restore order in classrooms. However, some teachers' unions have condemned the measures as a "regrettable militarization" of the education system, expressing concern over potential abuses of power. The move is part of a broader trend of authoritarian policies under President Bukele, who remains popular for his aggressive crackdown on gang violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, criticizing its focus on slavery as making the country look "horrible," reflect a long history of revisionist narratives. This article draws parallels between the administration's stance and the "lost cause" myth promoted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy a century ago, which sought to downplay the brutality of slavery and rebrand the Confederacy. By threatening to overhaul the museum's exhibits, the administration is seen as attempting to politicize cultural institutions and control historical narratives. The museum has been a major target in the administration's broader campaign to impose its ideology on federally funded cultural and educational bodies.</p>

The camp, which is set to become the nation's largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention site with a capacity of 5,000, is part of the Trump administration's agenda to accelerate mass deportations. Critics, including Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, have decried the facility as a "dangerous misuse of military land" and raised concerns about a lack of oversight, inadequate legal access for detainees, and the high cost of the private contracts used to operate it.</p>

          <p>A recent survey found that Americans, on average, believe the ideal age for retirement is 58, which is significantly younger than the current typical retirement ages of 64 for men and 62 for women. Financial advisors caution that retiring this early presents substantial challenges, including the need for a much larger nest egg to cover a potential 30 to 40-year period without work. Another major hurdle is securing health care coverage for the years before Medicare eligibility at age 65. Many who retire early do so not by choice but due to health or employment issues, and a significant number of retirees end up returning to work for financial reasons. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While standard sunscreen protects against UV radiation, dermatologists are increasingly recommending tinted sunscreens for their ability to also block visible light. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, skin conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, which gives tinted products their color. A recent review of studies confirmed that tinted sunscreens outperform non-tinted versions in protecting against visible light damage. Experts are calling for more research and standardized recommendations, as well as a wider range of shades to suit diverse skin tones.</p>
