          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's "low-altitude economy." This sector, which includes all air activities up to 1,000 meters, is considered a strategic emerging industry by Beijing, aimed at fostering innovation and economic expansion. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. This move is part of a broader government effort to create new, tech-focused jobs and build a comprehensive regulatory and industrial framework for the burgeoning drone and air mobility market.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man armed with a folding knife stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, leaving many in serious or critical condition. The attack, which authorities described as random, occurred near the checkout area before the suspect was apprehended by a sheriff's deputy and civilian shoppers. The victims were transported to a local medical center for treatment. Governor Gretchen Whitmer called the incident a "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is assisting the Grand Traverse County Sheriff's Office in the ongoing investigation. Walmart has stated that violence of this nature is unacceptable.</p>

          <h2>Nearly 4,000 NASA Employees Accept Deferred Resignation Offer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 21:35:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of its workforce, have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and comes amid proposed budget cuts for the space agency. While the administration's budget proposal suggested a significant funding decrease, Congress is considering keeping funding near current levels. The departures and budget uncertainty have drawn criticism from scientific organizations like The Planetary Society, which argue the moves undermine American leadership in space exploration and scientific discovery.</p>

          <p>Virginia Tech's athletic department has launched an internal investigation following accusations from North Carolina Central's head football coach, Trei Oliver. Oliver claimed that a Hokies assistant coach attempted to recruit one of his star running backs directly from the sideline during a game last season. He suggested this was an effort to persuade the player to enter the transfer portal, noting the player in question ultimately transferred to the University of Virginia. Virginia Tech stated it was previously unaware of the issue and is committed to upholding NCAA rules and integrity.</p>

In the other semi-final, Fernandez overcame third-seed Elena Rybakina in a marathon three-set thriller that lasted over three hours. Kalinskaya will now face Fernandez in the final, aiming for her first WTA 500 title in what is expected to be a competitive championship match.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary series is examining the history of the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement based in Northamptonshire that closed in 2019. The investigation, detailed in the article, reveals that hundreds of former members, including many children, suffered extensive physical and sexual abuse within the group's communal houses. The church's founder, Noel Stanton, who died in 2009, was accused of being a "predatory paedophile" and of covering up abuse with other senior leaders. The documentary explores the lasting trauma on survivors and the complex reasons people remain in such environments, highlighting a compensation scheme that has since made payments to victims.</p>

Five people were evaluated for minor injuries at the scene, with one later transported for medical attention. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, but operations have since returned to normal.

          <p>The Israeli military announced it has begun airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and will establish corridors for UN convoys, following intense international pressure over a severe hunger crisis. The move comes as reports of starvation-related deaths, including children, have increased. Aid organizations like the UN and UNICEF have warned of famine, stating that at least 85 children have died from malnutrition-related causes in the past three weeks. While Israel states there is no limit on aid trucks, the UN and other groups report that military restrictions and looting hamper distribution. The head of UNRWA criticized the airdrops as an inefficient "distraction" from the need for safe, overland aid access.</p>

Despite its removal from the Chinese school curriculum in 2017, researchers are now using modern scientific principles and newly discovered clues to build a functional replica.

          <p>Researchers at the University of New Mexico have discovered nanoplastic particles in human brain tissue for the first time, raising serious concerns about their long-term health effects. Scientists believe these microscopic particles originate from the breakdown of plastic waste and enter the body through food, water, and air. Dr. Matt Campen's lab found more plastic in the brains of people with dementia, and other studies are linking nanoplastics to increased risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. Long-term clinical studies are now underway to track the impact on children, with preliminary findings suggesting connections to hormonal issues, cognitive abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual, allowing a low-pressure system to dominate the region with persistent cloud cover. This pattern has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring colder deep-ocean water to the surface, further cooling the air. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>

The campaign, which promotes a line of jeans to raise money for a domestic violence charity, has been criticized by some as "tone-deaf" for its suggestive humor and focus on Sweeney's physique, which they argue sexualizes a serious issue. Conversely, many fans have defended the ad, with some praising it for "killing woke advertising." The controversy has also generated significant buzz, boosting American Eagle's stock price as the company bets on Sweeney's star power to revive sales and position itself as a trending "meme stock."

          <p>The union representing 12,000 grocery employees at Stater Bros. Markets in Southern California has voted to authorize a strike. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 stated the vote was a response to the company allegedly breaking the law through surveillance and discrimination against union members, tactics they label as "union-busting." This authorization does not trigger an immediate walkout, as bargaining negotiations are scheduled to continue. The labor dispute follows the expiration of the workers' contract in March and layoffs earlier in the year, which the company attributed to inflation and which were the first in its 89-year history.</p>

          <p>A review of Diana Ross's recent concert at the Hollywood Bowl captures the enduring appeal of the 81-year-old pop legend. The performance was praised for its energetic Motown medley, the tight musicianship of her large backing band, and her dazzling wardrobe changes. Amusing moments included Ross publicly calling out a sound engineer for a hot mic and her daughter Rhonda joining her on stage for a song. The show celebrated her entire career, from Supremes hits and her role in "The Wiz" to material from her 2021 album, "Thank You." The reviewer concluded that despite her frequent performances, seeing the icon on stage remains a worthwhile experience.</p>

          <p>Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America has confirmed a major data breach that exposed the personal information of most of its 1.4 million U.S. customers, as well as some financial professionals and employees. The Minneapolis-based company stated that a "malicious threat actor" used a social engineering technique to gain access to a third-party cloud system on July 16. While Allianz's internal systems were not compromised, the breach is significant, and the company has notified the FBI.

The vessel was located approximately 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik, Alaska, within the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf (ECS), an area where the U.S. claims exclusive rights to manage resources. A Coast Guard surveillance aircraft was dispatched to observe the ship. This incident follows recent detections of Russian military aircraft in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone and a joint Russo-Chinese bomber patrol in 2024, highlighting increasing foreign military and state-sponsored activity in the strategically important Arctic region.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from closure due to noise complaints from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing the new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in vacant shops and encourage outdoor dining and performances to bring "vibrancy" back to town centers. While the government touts the changes as a boost for the struggling hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical, blaming the government's own tax policies for the sector's economic pressures.

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a recall vote, allowing them to retain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political stalemate. The recall campaign targeted 24 lawmakers from the KMT and other opposition parties, accusing them of being "pro-China" and undermining national security by blocking President William Lai's agenda and cutting defense budgets. The opposition denies these claims, arguing they are providing necessary government oversight. The failure of the recall effort, which was the first of its kind on a national scale in Taiwan, means President Lai will likely face an emboldened, opposition-controlled parliament for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. Kenny convinced employees and suppliers that the 45,000-capacity event was real, boasting a lineup with major bands like The Killers and claiming backing from prominent investors and the Welsh government, all of which were false. The scheme unraveled when he failed to pay staff and suppliers, using what appeared to be forged documents to promise incoming funds. The article details how Kenny's "larger than life" persona and grand promises duped industry insiders, leaving many unpaid and highlighting the vulnerabilities within the festival industry.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route from Burbank to Las Vegas performed an aggressive dive of nearly 500 feet just minutes after takeoff to avoid a potential midair collision. Pilots on Flight 1496 responded to an onboard traffic alert warning them of another aircraft, a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet, in the vicinity. The sudden maneuver caused some unbelted passengers to hit the ceiling, though no serious injuries were reported among them. One flight attendant was treated for minor injuries. The flight continued safely to its destination, and the Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the near-miss incident.</p>
