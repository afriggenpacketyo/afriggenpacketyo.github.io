            <p>The Trump administration is considering cutting funding for NPR and PBS, alleging that these outlets are left-leaning and a "waste" of taxpayer money. A White House memo cited specific PBS documentaries and segments as evidence. NPR responded, stating that eliminating funding would have a devastating impact on communities that rely on public radio for trusted news and information, asserting their mission is to serve the public interest. The memo, however, did not explicitly state the intention to pull funding.</p>

            <p>Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) experienced a 4% increase following the news that Elliott Investment Management has acquired a stake exceeding $1.5 billion in the company. The activist investor intends to engage with HPE's management to explore strategies for enhancing shareholder value. While both Elliott and HPE have refrained from commenting on the matter, the stock's performance reflects investor optimism regarding potential improvements in the company's financial outlook. Shares of the data center equipment maker have lost more than a fourth of its value this year. Last month, the company topped quarterly revenue expectations but issued weak fiscal full-year guidance. HPE said it was grappling with higher discounting and expected price adjustments to weigh on its top-line growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's special envoy, seemingly reversed his stance on Iran's nuclear program, demanding its complete elimination after previously suggesting uranium enrichment at low levels could be permitted for civilian use. This policy shift could hinder the US's ability to reach a negotiated agreement with Iran, potentially reviving the threat of military action. The change in position may stem from backlash from Iran hawks or reflect chaotic foreign policymaking within the Trump administration. Iran insists on maintaining a civil nuclear program, making the US's new stance a potential point of contention and possibly strengthening hardliners in Tehran.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has issued a memo directing federal agencies to follow ten key Supreme Court rulings, a move praised by legal experts as a way to rein in the administrative state. The memo requires agencies to rescind regulations that conflict with these rulings, aligning with Trump's deregulatory agenda. While some litigators are skeptical about enforcement, experts suggest this directive could prompt agencies to re-evaluate existing regulations and reduce regulatory burdens. The memo also encourages the use of the Administrative Procedure Act’s “good cause” exception to expedite the process.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield experienced a slight decrease, slipping around 5 basis points to 4.316%, providing a temporary respite after a volatile week in the bond market. This volatility was triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which initially caused yields to drop before rebounding. Concerns about debt and hedge fund selling may have contributed to the sell-off in Treasurys.

            <p>A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S.'s inability to replace rare earth element supplies from China poses a significant threat to its defense capabilities. China's export controls on these elements, crucial for advanced defense technologies, could disrupt supply to U.S. firms. The U.S. lacks the capacity to fill the gap if China completely shuts down exports of medium and heavy rare earth elements. While the Department of Defense aims to develop a complete domestic supply chain by 2027, CSIS notes that output will fall short of China's for the foreseeable future.</p>

The defense claimed the brothers' blood-alcohol levels were above the legal limit. However, the judge deemed the issue moot under New Jersey criminal law. Prosecutors accuse the driver of being impaired by alcohol and fueled by road rage when he ran into the brothers, who were bicycling safely on the edge of the road.</p>

Abrego Garcia is currently being held in a Salvadoran mega-prison, and his lawyers express concern about the rule of law and due process.</p>

Crushing blows to Iran's Axis of Resistance and growing domestic discontent have forced Khamenei to consider negotiations.
