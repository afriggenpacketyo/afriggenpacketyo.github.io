Many graduates with strong academic records report being rejected for lacking sufficient real-world experience, creating a frustrating paradox. The article highlights the economic turbulence and heightened competition facing the newest members of the workforce. Career counselors are advising graduates to personalize their applications and engage in in-person networking, while also urging employers to relax stringent experience requirements for entry-level positions to give new talent a chance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this Wednesday, though the size of the reduction remains uncertain. The decision is complicated by conflicting economic data: a slowing labor market argues for a cut, while inflation, pushed higher by tariffs, suggests caution. President Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates, but Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the central bank's independence and reliance on economic data. Economists will be closely watching for the Fed's guidance on future policy, as the central bank navigates its dual mandate of controlling inflation and ensuring full employment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the career of Robert Redford, noting that despite his classic Hollywood good looks, he consistently rejected simple, heroic roles in favor of more complex and challenging characters. From his early days, Redford sidestepped lucrative but shallow opportunities to pursue roles that questioned the American ideal, such as in "The Candidate" and "Downhill Racer." The piece highlights his ability to use his charisma as a Trojan horse to explore darker themes of frustrated idealism and moral ambiguity. His career is framed not just by the iconic films he made, but also by the conventional ones he deliberately avoided.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the commencement of an expanded ground offensive in Gaza City, aimed at dismantling Hamas's military infrastructure. Residents were warned to evacuate south as Israeli divisions began pushing into the city's heart following a night of heavy airstrikes. The operation comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visiting Qatar and warning that the window of time for a negotiated peace deal is rapidly closing. The conflict continues to escalate, with Palestinian officials reporting numerous casualties from the recent strikes and hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of wounded.</p>

          <p>An independent commission of inquiry, established by the United Nations Human Rights Council, has released a report concluding there are reasonable grounds to believe Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report cites acts such as killing members of the group and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction. It also claims that statements from Israeli officials provide direct evidence of genocidal intent and calls on the international community to take action to prevent further crimes. Israel has categorically rejected the report, calling it distorted, false, and reliant on Hamas falsehoods.</p>

          <p>A coalition of University of California faculty, staff, and student organizations has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a campaign to undermine academic freedom and free speech. The lawsuit follows a $1.2 billion fine and a freeze on research funding at UCLA over accusations of antisemitism and civil rights violations. The plaintiffs claim the administration's demands, including government access to university data and a ban on overnight demonstrations, represent a grave threat to the university's independence. The UC system receives over $17 billion in federal support annually, making the funding freeze a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney has announced that five partially constructed homes in Laurel Canyon will finally be demolished after a two-decade-long legal fight. The homes were part of a larger development project that was halted in 2002 pending an environmental assessment that never occurred.

The current owners have pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders and are now required to demolish the homes by August 2026, ending a long-standing issue for the community.</p>

          <p>Authorities have charged George Zinn, a 71-year-old man, with obstruction of justice for allegedly making a false confession immediately after the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk. Police state that Zinn admitted he yelled "I shot him" to create a distraction, allowing the actual shooter to escape the scene. The primary suspect, Tyler Robinson, seemingly referenced this in a text message, noting police had "grabbed some crazy old dude." Zinn, who has a history of disrupting public events, was also charged with possession of child sexual abuse material found on his phone and is being held without bail.</p>

If the bill passes the House, it will move to the Senate, where it faces procedural hurdles and the need for 60 votes to overcome a potential filibuster.

          <p>President Donald Trump is suing The New York Times for defamation, seeking $15 billion in damages over three articles published in 2024 that he alleges were intended to harm his campaign. The lawsuit is seen by critics as part of a broader pattern by Trump to intimidate and suppress critical reporting from major news organizations. Legal experts believe the suit is unlikely to succeed due to the high legal standard of "actual malice" required for public figures to win defamation cases. The New York Times has dismissed the lawsuit as an attempt to stifle independent journalism that lacks legitimate legal claims.</p>

          <p>A Utah County prosecutor detailed the case against Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of murdering conservative activist Charlie Kirk, announcing an intent to seek the death penalty. Evidence includes text messages where Robinson allegedly confessed to his roommate, stating he acted out of hatred for Kirk's political views, saying "Some hate can’t be negotiated out." The charging documents reveal Robinson had planned the attack for over a week and used a rifle gifted by his grandfather. Robinson's own parents reportedly helped identify him to authorities after recognizing him in surveillance photos released to the public.</p>

Recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana, helped attract 13 million new users in just four days, bringing its total to 23 million since launch. The surge in popularity led to temporary usage limits over the weekend due to excess demand. This consumer success has also boosted investor confidence, contributing to Alphabet's recent entry into the $3 trillion market cap club.</p>

          <p>The 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan will feature NHL players for the first time in 12 years, a move Commissioner Gary Bettman expects will have a major impact on the league. The decision to return was driven by the players' strong desire to represent their countries and compete on a global stage. The league's previous withdrawal was due to issues with control and promotion, but a new deal with the IOC has improved commercial arrangements and player conditions. While the league will pause its season for two weeks, Bettman believes that on balance, the visibility and prestige of Olympic participation will be worthwhile.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, expressed skepticism about sports teams and ownership groups going public, despite soaring valuations. Speaking at a conference, Harris argued that sports assets have been valued more highly as private entities, and public markets have not always embraced the long-term, win-focused spending strategies of sports franchises. He pointed out that publicly traded teams often trade below their intrinsic value. With leagues like the NFL now allowing private equity investment, Harris believes owners have alternative ways to raise capital while maintaining the flexibility of private ownership.</p>

Ricks warned that capital investment flows to where it is welcomed and that the current UK policies make it difficult to consider new investments there.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point since late 2022, as investors anticipate an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. This decline reflects market sentiment ahead of the Fed's upcoming meeting, where a rate reduction is widely expected. However, some analysts caution that this trend could reverse after the official announcement, a pattern observed in previous rate-cut cycles. Experts note that historically, Fed cuts during non-recessionary periods have not always translated to sustained lower long-term rates, suggesting potential volatility for mortgage costs in the coming weeks.

The author contends that nations must move beyond simply producing a few machine-learning engineers and instead focus on democratizing AI knowledge for the entire workforce. This involves teaching citizens how to use AI to augment their roles in various industries, from healthcare to manufacturing. To achieve this, governments should invest in accessible platforms that can rapidly reskill the population, ensuring that human and digital capabilities are effectively combined to drive national productivity and innovation.</p>
