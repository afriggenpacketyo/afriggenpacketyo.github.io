            <h2>Trump Envoy Steve Witkoff Travels to Russia Amidst Prisoner Exchange</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Russia, according to the Kremlin, arriving in St. Petersburg on Friday. This trip occurred a day after a dual U.S.-Russian national, Ksenia Karelina, was exchanged for Arthur Petrov, who was accused of forming a global smuggling spy ring. Witkoff's visit raises questions about potential discussions or negotiations between the U.S. and Russia, especially given the current geopolitical tensions and the recent prisoner swap. The timing of the visit is particularly noteworthy and adds a layer of intrigue to the already complex relationship between the two nations.</p>

            <p>China announced it is increasing tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response to escalating trade tensions with the United States. The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S.'s approach to tariffs as a "numbers game" with no practical economic significance and stated that it had filed another complaint with the World Trade Organization over U.S. tariffs. President Trump's universal tariffs on China now total 145%, further intensifying the trade war between the two countries, with China vowing to counter any infringement on its interests.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is using the McCarran-Walter Act, a Cold War-era law, to justify the deportation of immigrant student protestors, raising concerns about free speech rights. This law allows the U.S. government to deport non-citizens whose activities are believed to have adverse foreign policy consequences. The administration argues that pro-Palestinian protestors are supporting terrorism, while critics argue that the law is being used to suppress dissent and revive discriminatory practices from the 1950s. The case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student facing deportation, highlights the implications of this controversial law.</p>

            <p>Congressional Democrats are facing criticism for opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, which aims to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending. DOGE's findings, such as the discovery of millions of Social Security numbers given to non-citizens, have put Democrats on the defensive. Critics argue that Democrats' opposition to DOGE's efforts suggests they are supportive of fraud and waste within government programs. This situation has sparked a debate about government accountability and the effectiveness of existing oversight mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Despite potential economic harm, Trump's aggressive stance towards Canada may inadvertently strengthen Canadian identity and economy. By blaming Canada for U.S. problems, Trump has inspired solidarity and economic patriotism among Canadians. This situation is pushing Canada to diversify its trade relationships beyond the U.S. and to reduce internal trade barriers, potentially fostering a more resilient and independent economy. The brain drain from the U.S. may also benefit Canada, attracting skilled workers and further boosting its economy.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is under scrutiny for allegedly using Social Security data to push narratives about noncitizens voting, potentially violating a court order.

Concerns are growing that DOGE's access to sensitive data may be used inappropriately and violate privacy laws.

            <p>A recent study reveals that some large tropical trees, particularly Dipteryx oleifera, not only survive lightning strikes but also benefit from them. The lightning's energy clears parasitic vines and eliminates nearby competing trees, allowing the Dipteryx oleifera to thrive. Researchers believe the tree's high electrical conductivity may be a key factor in its survival, enabling it to disperse the energy without significant damage. This discovery offers insights into the resilience of certain species and their adaptation to extreme environmental events.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war dominated the week, causing market instability, followed by a temporary pause on some tariffs, while increasing tariffs on China to 145%. The Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration on deportations and government firings, granting temporary leeway. Congress narrowly approved a budget framework paving the way for Trump's legislative agenda, and Trump continued his campaign of retribution against perceived adversaries. This week highlighted the administration's focus on trade, immigration, and political retribution, often resulting in unpredictable policy shifts.</p>

Starlings, known for their noisy chatter and murmurations, are among the UK's fastest disappearing birds. The RSPB encourages small actions in gardens, such as avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes, to support starlings and other wildlife. The survey involved nearly 600,000 people counting over nine million birds, highlighting the importance of gardens as habitats for wildlife.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is undergoing his annual physical, potentially providing the first detailed health information in years. Trump, who became the oldest president to be sworn in, has historically been reluctant to share medical details. The examination at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center follows an assassination attempt against him last July. Trump's previous health disclosures have been limited, often consisting of flattering reports with scarce details.</p>

            <p>Republicans face significant challenges after narrowly passing their budget plan, needing to draft legislation that satisfies conservatives while protecting vulnerable lawmakers. The plan aims to extend tax cuts and cut spending, but divisions within the party threaten its success. Democrats frame the debate as Republicans prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of key government programs. The process requires navigating competing interests and potential electoral consequences, making the road ahead daunting.</p>

            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding expectations, driven by a strong performance in the services sector. However, the positive figures come as the UK braces for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the US. Analysts warn that the growth could be short-lived due to the tariffs and domestic factors. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the growth an "encouraging sign" but emphasized the need for further action to boost the economy.</p>
