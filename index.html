        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is a strong favorite for the Premier League Golden Boot, having scored nine goals in his first seven games, all from open play. This article highlights his impressive start, noting that he is generating significantly more high-quality scoring opportunities than any other player, with an average expected goals (xG) value of 0.27 per shot this season. His dominant early form is bolstered by the relatively slower starts from his usual rivals for the award. While the European Golden Shoe race is more competitive with Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe also in form, Haaland's prolific non-penalty goal tally positions him as a leading contender.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies, including Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla, collectively lost $770 billion in market capitalization on Friday, causing the Nasdaq to drop 3.6% and the S&P 500 to fall 2.7%. This article explains that the steepest decline since April was triggered by President Donald Trump's threats of increased tariffs on Chinese goods, disrupting a sustained rally driven by AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia, a key AI chip maker, saw its market cap shrink by nearly $229 billion. Following market close, Trump announced a 100% tariff on China and export controls on critical software, leading to further declines in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported finding up to 100,000 Western-made components in Russian drones and rockets used in recent attacks, despite international sanctions. This article investigates how high-tech parts from the US, Europe, and Taiwan are still reaching Russia through convoluted intermediary routes in countries like China, UAE, and Kazakhstan. While sanctions have driven up prices and caused delays for Russia, experts like Benjamin Hilgenstock of the Kyiv School of Economics suggest manufacturers need to be held more accountable for their distribution networks. The article concludes that political will is needed to close existing loopholes in the sanctions regime.</p>

This article explains that Wanjiru's body was found in a septic tank near a British army training camp, and an inquest in 2019 concluded she was unlawfully killed by British soldiers. The family and rights groups accuse the British army of a cover-up and Kenyan authorities of initial investigative failures, highlighting the ongoing struggle for justice.</p>

          <p>Germany is currently debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as "catcalling," in public spaces. This article explains that unlike some other European countries, such behavior is not explicitly covered by Germany's sexual offenses legislation or typically by insult laws. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are pushing to close this legal loophole, arguing that such harassment significantly intimidates victims and leads to their withdrawal from public life. While some conservatives question the need for new legislation, the debate highlights a widespread issue, particularly affecting young women, and draws on precedents from other European nations like France and Belgium.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have identified a significant "mismatch" between fertility incentives and local birth rates across the country, as detailed in a study published in Population and Economics. This article highlights the paradoxical situation in Guangdong, a southern economic powerhouse and the top contributor of newborns, which surprisingly offers one of the least supportive environments for childbirth. The report, from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications and the China Population and Development Research Centre, suggests that current policy support is not effectively aligned with fertility conditions. Researchers advocate for in-depth studies to understand these intrinsic connections better, aiming to provide a more scientific foundation for future demographic policymaking.</p>

This article notes the White House described it as a "routine yearly checkup," despite the recent annual physical. A summary from Trump's doctor, Sean Barbabella, stated the visit was for health maintenance and included advanced imaging and lab testing, concluding he is in "exceptional health" with a cardiac age 14 years younger than his chronological age of 79. The visit aimed to dispel rumors about his health following recent public appearances.</p>

          <p>A wave of anti-China demonstrations in South Korea is threatening Seoul's efforts to improve relations with Beijing, particularly as the APEC summit approaches. This article reports that despite a new visa-free scheme attracting Chinese tourists, public backlash stems from China's past punitive economic measures over a US anti-missile system deployment in 2016. President Lee Jae-myung, seen as more Beijing-friendly, has ordered measures to curb the rallies, but observers believe the fierce resentment will persist. The protests add to public anxiety in the South regarding North Korea, complicating the diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland, Paula Xinis, vowed to rule "as soon as possible" on the legal status of Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose deportation to a third country is planned by the Trump administration. This article reports on a marathon seven-hour hearing where Judge Xinis criticized the administration for failing to produce a knowledgeable witness and for providing contradictory information about countries willing to accept Garcia. Despite government claims, none of the three African nations initially identified agreed to take him. Garcia's lawyers argue he should be sent to Costa Rica, which has agreed to grant him refugee status, while the government presses for other options.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun laying off thousands of federal workers, with Russell Vought, OMB director, announcing that "RIFs have begun" as the government shutdown nears its third week. This article reports that court filings revealed over 4,000 employees across seven agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services, received layoff notices.

          <p>Verizon customers across Los Angeles County experienced widespread cellular and internet service outages due to "multiple fiber cuts caused by acts of vandalism." This article reports that the company confirmed the cause after issues began Friday morning, emphasizing the dangerous impact on families, students, and businesses, as well as a direct threat to public safety. Authorities note that thieves often target wiring for copper, but fiber optic cables, made of plastic and glass, yield no such metal, making the vandalism fruitless. Assemblyman Mark González has drafted a bill requiring a state license to resell copper wire to combat such thefts.</p>

This article reports that White House OMB Director Russell Vought confirmed "reductions in force" have begun, fulfilling President Trump's goal of reducing the federal workforce. Unions have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of these unprecedented layoffs, which differ from past shutdowns where furloughed employees were retroactively paid.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations at New York City's 26 Federal Plaza have created a "traumatic" environment, with attorneys and journalists witnessing aggressive detentions and clashes. This article highlights an incident where Monica Moreta Galarza was thrown to the ground as her husband was detained, leading to an officer's temporary suspension. Data suggests that half of ICE detentions in the NYC area since Trump's inauguration occurred at this courthouse, with three-quarters of those arrested having no prior criminal convictions. Critics argue that these tactics, which force immigrants to choose between detention or automatic deportation for missing court, constitute an abuse of the legal system.</p>
