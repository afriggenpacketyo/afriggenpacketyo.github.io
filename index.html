        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents, particularly in Manitoba, where a state of emergency has been declared. The fires, exacerbated by hot, dry conditions, are also impacting air quality in parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes regions of the United States. Resources are stretched thin as officials struggle to contain the blazes, with the U.S. sending aid, including firefighters and equipment, to assist in the efforts. The worst-ever wildfire season was in 2023, and this year's fires threaten to cause similar widespread disruption and health risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough decisions as it finalizes its spending plans for various sectors, including healthcare, defense, and education. With funding increases slowing down after a period of sharp growth, the level of spending on the NHS will significantly influence potential cuts to other unprotected areas. The government aims to scrutinize every pound spent, but Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance against borrowing more money or raising taxes suggests that spending cuts are likely. The IFS emphasizes that prioritizing health and defense spending will necessitate difficult trade-offs in other departments. (not investment advice)</p>

Words were exchanged, and Mayo shoved Sosa, prompting both benches to empty onto the field before order was restored.

          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House after a UN nuclear watchdog report indicated Iran has increased its enriched uranium production. The proposal follows concerns that Iran now possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons-grade levels. While details of the deal remain unclear, the US hopes Iran will accept the proposal to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, dismissing the IAEA report as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>A new TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" of full-fat Coke and salty fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, but experts caution against relying on it as a cure. While some individuals find relief from the caffeine and sugar in Coke or the salt in fries, migraine is a complex neurological condition that cannot be cured by fast food. Experts warn that excessive caffeine can trigger migraines and that fast food often contains compounds that can exacerbate the condition. Sufferers are advised to listen to their bodies and seek medical advice rather than relying on social media hacks.</p>
