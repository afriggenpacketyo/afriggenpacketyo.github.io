        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI is investigating a deadly explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which killed one person and injured four others, occurred on North Indian Canyon Drive, near East Tachevah Drive, an area with several healthcare facilities. Authorities have identified a person-of-interest but do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the public, though the motive remains unknown. The explosion extended several blocks, damaging nearby buildings, and prompted evacuations in Twentynine Palms to avoid a potential blast zone. The clinic is expected to reopen on Monday after the staff was confirmed to be unharmed and the IVF lab remained intact.</p>

          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK anticipate a "stonking start" to the 2025 season due to warm days and cool nights, which enhance the fruit's sweetness. Despite a dry spring and warnings of a potential summer drought, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. Farmers are reporting that the strawberries are ripening at a phenomenal rate and are of good size and sweetness, and the Summer Berry Company has already seen increased production. Consumers can look forward to particularly flavorful berries this summer, with suggestions to pair them with black pepper, balsamic vinegar, or chilli for added depth.</p>

International mediators are pushing for a ceasefire deal, but Hamas insists on a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war, conditions Israel rejects.

          <p>Moodyâ€™s downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. This move may add pressure on US government debt, potentially leading to higher yields on Treasury bills. The downgrade reflects worries about the US's fiscal trajectory and the failure of politicians to address the growing debt. While the market impact may be contained, the downgrade could make investors more cautious about US debt. Some analysts note that the US's ability to issue its own currency mitigates the risk of default.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has experienced a record low support rate of 27.4% due to growing dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising prices.

A majority of poll respondents believe it is necessary to slash consumption taxes to address the cost-of-living crisis.

          <p>President Trump is pushing forward with a new section of border wall in the San Rafael Valley, Arizona, a biodiverse region that serves as a crucial wildlife corridor. The wall will sever migration routes for animals like bears, mountain lions, and jaguars, impacting the ecosystem. Critics argue the project is expensive, unnecessary, and environmentally disastrous, particularly as unauthorized crossings have fallen. Concerns are also raised about the militarization of public lands along the border, which could further disrupt wildlife habitats.</p>
