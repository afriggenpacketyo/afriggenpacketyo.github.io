          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its efforts to exert control over academic decision-making. The lawsuit aims to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands, including appointing an overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard President Alan Garber argues that the government should not dictate what universities teach or who they admit, emphasizing the potential consequences for research, students, and the standing of American higher education. The Trump administration claims Harvard fails to meet basic conditions for accessing taxpayer funds, painting campus protests as anti-American and antisemitic, a claim Garber refutes.</p>

          <p>Following a destructive wildfire in Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass is proposing to add 227 positions to the Fire Department, including firefighters and emergency medical technicians. This proposal comes amid budget constraints in other city agencies and aims to address under-resourcing issues within the Fire Department. The expansion also includes a new Homeless Fire Protection and Street Medicine Program to address the rising number of fires connected to homelessness, reflecting a shift in priorities after criticism of the department's response to the Palisades fire. The City Council will review the mayor's budget proposal, with some officials advocating for even greater investment in the Fire Department.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. The map reveals connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially helping to understand the role of this region in cognitive functions. Significant differences were found between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could provide clues to the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. This research advances the understanding of how consciousness is generated and why human awareness differs from other animals.</p>

The experiment involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of creating a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. Researchers are exploring precision fermentation to produce ingredients that can be 3D printed into various dishes, potentially revolutionizing food production for long-term space missions and making humanity a multi-planetary species.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had rejected the administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Harvard alleges that the Trump administration violated the university's constitutional rights by halting federal funding.</p>
