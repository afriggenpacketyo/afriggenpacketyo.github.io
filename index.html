          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of engaging in "fantasy economics" regarding their welfare policy proposals. Badenoch criticizes their consideration of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, arguing that taxpayers should not fund unlimited child support. Her remarks follow statements from both Labour and Reform UK indicating a potential shift in welfare policies. Badenoch asserts that the Conservative Party is the only major party seriously addressing the welfare state, saying Britain deserves leaders who do not "treat economics like a branch of showbiz".</p>

          <p>Nika Melia, a key figure in Georgia's largest opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, accused of insulting law enforcement officers. This is the second detention of an opposition leader in recent days, following Zurab Japaridze's pre-trial detention for refusing to appear at a parliamentary inquiry. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of adopting authoritarian tactics similar to those employed by Moscow, steering the country away from its European aspirations. The government denies these allegations, despite ongoing protests against the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence, which is seen as a threat to Georgia's democratic values. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's order that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the administration to continue collecting import taxes for now. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly second-guessed the president and threatened trade negotiations. The ruling had challenged tariffs imposed on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as a blanket 10% import tax on goods from other countries. The appeals court decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5. </p>
