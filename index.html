            <p>President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he "got every answer right" on a cognitive test during his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While he didn't release specific medical details, he indicated the full report would be released soon. This exam marks the first physical of his second term, and Trump, at 78, emphasized feeling well while acknowledging the necessity of these routine checks. The public has not had a detailed look into Trump's health since 2018, despite promises made during the 2024 campaign to provide updates.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe to prevent its imminent closure. MPs have been called back from their Easter break to pass emergency legislation that would allow the government to assume control of some of the site's operations. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, employs 2,700 people and is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The company claims it is losing £700,000 a day and blames market conditions and costs associated with transitioning to lower-carbon production.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from the District Attorney's Office. The Menendez brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have spent over 30 years in prison. Former DA George Gascón filed a motion to reduce their sentences and grant parole eligibility, but current DA Nathan Hochman sought to withdraw this motion. The judge's decision allows the resentencing process to move forward, offering the brothers a potential path to freedom through either resentencing or clemency from the governor.</p>

The book aims to provide a deeper understanding of Venezuela, highlighting how a society can make wrong decisions and destroy what it built. He emphasizes that democracy cannot be taken for granted, using a Jenga tower as a metaphor for the fragility of a nation's structure.</p>

            <p>A federal judge upheld a Trump administration policy allowing ICE enforcement operations in churches and places of worship, despite lawsuits from faith-based groups citing infringement on religious freedoms. Judge Dabney Friedrich found little evidence that ICE is targeting churches or that the policy is solely responsible for decreased attendance. The policy, which rescinded Obama-era guidelines discouraging arrests in "sensitive locations," requires ICE officers to apply "common sense" and "discretion." Other legal challenges to immigration enforcement in sensitive locations are ongoing.</p>

The decision came on the same day Trump lawyers were criticized for defying an order to provide details on how they would return a wrongly deported man to the US. This ruling is based on a memo from the secretary of state stating Khalil’s “beliefs and associations” were counter to foreign policy interests, without any allegations of criminal conduct.

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's system, which affected the code used to exempt freight from new tariffs, was resolved after more than 10 hours. The glitch impacted U.S. shippers attempting to claim exemptions for goods already in transit before recent tariff announcements. The incident caused confusion and uncertainty among U.S. companies, raising concerns about Customs' ability to manage the new tariff policies effectively. To keep cargo moving, Customs advised firms to pay duties and tariffs within ten days of the cargo's release.</p>

If China can endure the tariffs, it may embolden Beijing in future cross-strait conflicts. Washington has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent – close to the punitive amount President Donald Trump previously threatened if Beijing were to attack Taiwan.</p>

            <p>The University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law hosted an event to remember Freddie Gray and discuss the progress and challenges in ensuring fair policing. Speakers noted that Gray's death sparked some needed change, such as the consent decree and body camera programs. However, there was a consensus that more work needs to be done to ensure public safety for everyone, regardless of race. Former Baltimore Police deputy commissioner Melvin Russell argued that the consent decree is taking too long to implement.</p>

            <p>Argentina's central bank has announced major exchange rate policy changes, including letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band, ahead of a $20 billion IMF deal. Economists have offered varied perspectives, with some expressing surprise at the amount of money available and cautioning about potential market nervousness. Others see the move as a devaluation and highlight the limits on central bank intervention. The IMF deal is viewed as an important anchor to help Argentina prepare for its adjustment phase.

            <p>The "Dubai chocolate" bar, a pistachio and Knafeh-inspired treat from FIX Chocolatier in the UAE, has become a viral sensation on TikTok, leading to imitations in UK supermarkets. The original bar's exclusivity and unique flavors have contributed to its popularity, but the copycat versions are causing frustration for the original creators. While FIX chocolate is billed as a "dessert bar" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items, the other versions have been designed to have a longer shelf life.</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, was found guilty of murder for his 2017 death, where he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home.

            <p>A US judge has ruled the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained last month over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. In a letter written from the facility, he has said his "arrest was a direct consequence" of speaking out for Palestinian rights. The government has cited a Cold War-era immigration law, declaring that his presence in the US was adverse to American foreign policy interests. The judge gave his lawyers until 23 April to appeal against the order.</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli was accused of cheating on Fabio with that racquetball coach Robert Baker and then—along with Baker— planning Fabio's murder. Police say the plan was to stage the scene to make it look like the work of the knock-knock burglars and throw police off their trail. Prosecutors say that first hooded figure — in the green sweatshirt— is Robert Baker. As a result, Monica Sementilli's trial is scheduled for April 2, 2024. Gessica and Isabella, the daughters she shared with Fabio, are standing by their mother.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors allege that the ongoing jailhouse love affair between Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker is further evidence of the murder conspiracy. Police used undercover officers and sting operations to record the defendants' interactions, including jail letters, cellmate conversations, and recordings from holding cells. In jail sting, Robert Baker mentions Monica Sementilli facing "difficulty" of being "disowned" for loving and wanting to marry him. All this is alleged to be evidence of murder and conspiracy.</p>
