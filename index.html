          <p>President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp., signaling a potential turning point for the U.S. steel industry. Trump announced that the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the American economy, with the bulk of the investment occurring over the next 14 months. Nippon Steel expressed respect for the decision, while U.S. Steel appreciated Trump's leadership in securing the futures of thousands of steelworkers and the iconic company, which will remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States previously reviewed the acquisition plan under former President Joe Biden but failed to reach a consensus, leading to Trump's reexamination of the deal.

          <p>Following President Donald Trump's gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, several attendees were invited to tour the White House.

Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul and top investor, posted a video of his White House tour.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to send hundreds of border agents to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the U.S. interior. This initiative involves approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Border Patrol agents and members of the Office of Field Operations. The deployment aims to bolster immigration enforcement operations across ICE's 25 field offices, potentially starting as early as next week. This move reflects the administration's broader effort to utilize federal resources for its crackdown on illegal immigration, even as illegal border crossings have reached historic lows.</p>

          <p>SebastiÃ£o Salgado, the renowned Brazilian photojournalist, has died at 81, leaving behind a legacy of powerfully impactful images of nature and the human condition. From his small town in Brazil, Salgado traveled the world, documenting human suffering and the grandeur of nature. His photographs, often in stark black and white, captured famine-stricken refugee camps, gold miners toiling in Brazil, and the beauty of the Amazon rainforest. Salgado's work brought together the immediacy of individual suffering and the enormity of the dire realities he documented.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed frustration and called for a review of the rules.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been running the NSC since the previous national security advisor was effectively dismissed, creating an unusual double-role.</p>

          <p>A water leak has caused damage to all seven floors of a recently constructed high-tech computer science building at USC. The leak originated from the attic of Ginsburg Hall, a 116,000-square-foot building that opened in September. The building houses advanced technology, including robotics labs and a two-story lab for autonomous aerial vehicles. Researchers have been notified to check their equipment, and the building is closed for repairs.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States are thriving due to human influence on their habitat, specifically the use of backyard feeders. The study in Global Change Biology found that hummingbird feeders have changed the size and shape of the birds' beaks. Beaks have grown longer and more slender, aiding in nectar consumption, and males' beaks have become pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbird's range has also expanded northward, influenced by eucalyptus forests introduced to California.</p>
