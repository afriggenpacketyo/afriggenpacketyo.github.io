          <p>As gold prices hover near record highs and expectations of further increases grow, both beginner and experienced investors may want to consider adjusting their strategies. Beginners should consider investing now, even at high prices, as waiting for a lower entry point may be futile. Fractional gold investments can make entry more accessible, and investors should resist the temptation to sell quickly, viewing gold as a long-term inflation hedge. Veteran investors should hold steady, consider buying more to reach a 10% portfolio allocation, and remember the initial reasons for investing, consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

          <p>Tensions escalated between Israel and Iran as Israel launched airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, leading to retaliatory missile attacks from Iran. Israel's military reported hitting over 100 targets, including sites in Tehran and Natanz, prompting Iran to launch over 100 drones and missiles at Israel. The U.S. assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian missiles, and U.S. troops in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers during the strikes. The exchange raises concerns about an escalating regional conflict, with potential involvement from Iran-backed groups and possible impacts on U.S. interests and nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, signaling increased optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. The resurgence ended six months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping sharply from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, political party, and geographic region. The rollbacks of tariffs between the U.S. and China and on goods from Mexico and Canada are factors in the sentiment improvement, though some tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Israel's strikes against Iran's military leadership and nuclear program, the question remains whether the Trump administration will support the war it previously opposed. Initial reports suggested the U.S. was aware of the attack but did little to stop it, but Trump later expressed enthusiasm, potentially hoping the operation will force Iran to make concessions. The U.S. may become more involved if Israel requires assistance with heavy bunker-buster bombs or if Iran's retaliation escalates. Iran's response, potentially including attacks on U.S. interests or proxies, could also draw the U.S. into a direct conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Iran are in jeopardy after Israel's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders. The attack has made it less likely that Iran will accept the prospect of surrendering its enrichment capability and may lead to Iranian attacks on U.S. interests. While Trump continues to believe a diplomatic solution is possible, he is also playing catch-up after the administration was only given notice about the attacks hours before they began. The U.S. is likely to aid Israel in the event of an Iranian counterattack, but the Pentagon must also be ready for strikes against U.S. troops in the region.</p>

The first and most visible strike took place in the opening hours of the Israeli air campaign, which began overnight on Thursday.

Satellite imagery shows damage to several buildings at the Natanz site that are used to assemble centrifuges. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel believed Iran had recently restarted its program to build a nuclear weapon and that the operation's goal was to "strike at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program."</p>

          <p>Debt settlement is a process where you negotiate with your creditors to pay less than the full amount you owe. It typically applies to unsecured debts and is often used as a last resort when a borrower can't afford to pay off their debt in full. The process typically takes 24 to 48 months on average, depending on how much debt you have and how much you're able to save. Debt settlement can offer real advantages, especially for borrowers who have exhausted other options. (not investment advice)</p>
