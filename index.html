          <p>President Trump addressed business leaders at the White House after the US economy contracted by 0.3%, blaming his predecessor for the downturn and requesting more time to revitalize the economy. He highlighted planned investments in technology, healthcare, and infrastructure, while also urging Congress to pass his tax bill. The economic contraction comes amid Trump's imposition of import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets, leading to criticism from Democrats who argue that the current economic state is a result of Trump's policies.

          <p>A federal judge determined that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction from the Epic Games case and that an Apple executive lied under oath regarding App Store fees. The judge accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior, withholding documentation, and abusing privilege to conceal its decision-making process. Effective immediately, Apple is ordered to stop imposing commissions on purchases made for iPhone apps through web links inside an app and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees. Apple intends to appeal the decision, while Epic Games celebrates it as a victory for developers, as it forces Apple to compete with other payment services.</p>

Experts suggest Japan can act as an intermediary between ASEAN and the US, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and stability in the South China Sea, while also upholding values like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The US and Ukraine have finalized a deal for the joint exploitation of Ukrainian energy and mineral resources, which establishes a reconstruction investment fund aimed at boosting Ukraine's economic recovery. The agreement is seen as crucial for Kyiv to access US military aid, with Ukraine possessing significant reserves of minerals like graphite, titanium, and lithium. This deal comes amidst a US trade war with China, where most of the world's rare-earth stocks are sourced, and it demonstrates US solidarity with Ukraine, as the agreement specifies that no entity involved in financing the Russian war effort will benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that Americans may have to do with less as a result of the trade war with China, stating that while some may have fewer goods, it's necessary to secure a fair deal.

Trump also downplayed fears of shortages, suggesting that Americans don't need many of the goods imported from China, thus minimizing the potential impact of the trade war on American consumers.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators have concluded a controlled fire in Pacific Palisades as part of their investigation into the January blaze that killed a dozen people and destroyed thousands of homes. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted the fire test along the Temescal Ridge Trail, hoping to determine the fire's exact point of origin and how it spread during a windstorm. Investigators are exploring whether an earlier 8-acre blaze sparked by fireworks reignited, though they have not ruled out other potential causes.</p>

          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure, highlighting divisions over the economic impact of the tariffs. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but fell short of the votes needed for passage. While anxieties over the economic impact of the tariffs persist, House Republican leadership has taken steps to prevent members from forcing a vote to block the levies.</p>

Union leaders are urging Trump to take real action on the issue, as inflation has increased the financial burden on tipped workers. While there are two bills in Congress aimed at addressing the issue, the revenue from tariffs could potentially fund the plan, and workers hope that bipartisan support and presidential backing will lead to a resolution.

While Trump insists he will produce trade deals to boost growth, the economic pain of tariffs could start within months, with upward pressure on prices and shortages of both industrial and consumer products made abroad.
