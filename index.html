          <p>OpenAI announced that its ChatGPT platform is projected to reach 700 million weekly active users, a fourfold increase year-over-year. This rapid expansion is accompanied by significant financial momentum, with the company securing $8.3 billion in new investments and annual recurring revenue hitting $13 billion. To support this growth, OpenAI is making massive investments in AI infrastructure, including a $500 billion joint venture and major data center deals with partners like Oracle and G42.

While such sales can sometimes signal internal perspectives on a company's future, the motivations for executive stock transactions can vary widely.

The campaign, which uses the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," has drawn criticism, with some claiming it promotes eugenics or is overly sexualized. American Eagle responded by stating the campaign is simply about jeans and celebrating confidence. Trump's praise highlights a cultural flashpoint, contrasting with the backlash the ad has received from some critics.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that the First Amendment's principle of separating church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, is facing severe challenges. The article traces the historical context of this "lively experiment," noting how it has fostered religious pluralism while preventing sectarian conflict from impeding government. It points to recent legislative efforts in red states, such as using public funds for religious education, and judicial complicity as incremental attacks undermining this foundational wall. The author warns against trading a successful system for one that has failed elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The July jobs report, which showed a weaker-than-expected gain of only 73,000 nonfarm payrolls and significant downward revisions for previous months, has intensified concerns about a sharp economic slowdown. Economists now point to the lagging labor market as a key indicator that recession risks are elevated, with some placing the probability at 50%. While second-quarter GDP growth appeared strong, the first-half average was much weaker, and consumer spending is showing signs of strain. The data has fueled debate over potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, even as the White House maintains an optimistic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed map, supported by Donald Trump, could create up to five new Republican-leaning districts and is seen by Democrats as a partisan power grab that could rig future elections.

Experts warn that a typical borrower could accumulate over $200 in interest per month by staying put.

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods, which were scheduled to take effect this week. This suspension provides time for both sides to implement the broader trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump. An EU spokesperson stated the move is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The underlying deal includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods but is still being finalized, with this delay seen as a key step in the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, following an incident with a boat on Saturday. New Jersey State Police reported that the whale appeared to charge at a 21-foot vessel, causing a passenger to be thrown overboard, though no human injuries were reported. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Officials are planning to tow the whale to a state park to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death and the circumstances leading to the unusual encounter.</p>

          <p>Amazon is laying off approximately 110 employees from its Wondery podcast division and its CEO is stepping down as part of a major restructuring of the company's audio business. The move will see some of Wondery's teams consolidated under the Audible division to better integrate operations. This reorganization separates teams focused on narrative podcasts from those developing creator-led shows, a response to the evolving podcast landscape and the rise of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube. The changes are intended to streamline the division and create a better experience for creators and advertisers.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed foods compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter met official nutritional guidelines. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This was the largest and longest randomized controlled trial on the topic to date. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, beyond just nutritional content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has endorsed a controversial migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for future state-run facilities. She stated that DHS is considering similar sites near airports in states like Arizona and Louisiana to increase the efficiency of detaining and deporting unauthorized migrants. The Florida facility has faced legal challenges and criticism from attorneys over constitutional rights and humane conditions. Noem argued the model is a cost-effective and strong deterrent, claiming it sends a clear message about the consequences of illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with large downward revisions, has been condemned by former agency heads and economic groups.

A bipartisan group of former BLS commissioners, including one appointed by Trump, called the firing meritless and stated it "undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics."

This visit comes amid a recent shift in Trump's rhetoric, which has become more critical of Russia's actions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "60% reverse mortgage rule," a key regulation for Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) that can significantly impact seniors tapping into their home equity. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year, unless a larger amount is needed to pay off mandatory obligations like an existing mortgage. While designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their equity too quickly, this restriction can pose challenges for those needing a larger lump sum for immediate expenses. It encourages long-term financial planning but may make reverse mortgages less suitable for some borrowers' needs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite his extensive career in blockbuster films like "Dune" and the "Avengers" series, Brolin said he was drawn to the project because he was unsure if he could perform in the genre.
