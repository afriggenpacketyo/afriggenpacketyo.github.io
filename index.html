          <h2>Merz Fails to Secure Chancellorship in Initial German Parliament Vote</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 08:45:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader in Germany, fell short of the required majority in a parliament vote to become chancellor, despite his coalition holding enough seats. This failure is unprecedented in modern German history, as no candidate has failed in this way since 1949, undermining his hopes of leading a strong government. The far-right party called for fresh elections following the vote. A second vote is planned, with Merz remaining the coalition's candidate, although the Social Democrats were adamant their party was fully committed to the coalition, so nobody knows for sure why Merz didn't garner enough votes. The article notes that Europe needs a strong Germany.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite growing calls within the Labour party to reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, the UK government insists it will not change its policy. The government restricted eligibility for the annual payments to ensure economic stability, a move that has faced criticism following recent local election losses. Labour Welsh First Minister Baroness Eluned Morgan has called on the UK government to 'rethink' the policy in a speech on Tuesday, adding it 'comes up time and again' with voters. The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of Â£200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to Â£300 for over-80s, paid in November or December.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Constitution mandates 'due process of law' for all non-citizens on U.S. soil, though the specifics remain contested, this article explains. While President Trump insists this doesn't mean individual trials for millions, legal experts confirm the Constitution doesn't guarantee a trial for every migrant detained. The Supreme Court has stated that detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, appropriate to the nature of their case. However, the specifics of 'notice' and 'hearing' depend on an immigrant's status and circumstances, such as whether they are seeking asylum, and under the 'expedited removal' program, migrants within 100 miles of the border can be deported without a hearing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, report a slowdown in North American sales from Hispanic shoppers, who represent a significant portion of the U.S. consumer base. Executives attribute this decline to economic concerns and fears surrounding stricter immigration policies. A contributing factor to the dip, some experts say, is fear around stricter immigration policy. The Latino unemployment rate ticked up to a seasonally adjusted 5.2% in April, from 4.8% a year earlier and 5.1% in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some companies are prioritizing efforts to win back Hispanic consumers through targeted advertising and acquisitions.</p>

The Costume Institute has never had a Black curator, and the Met has its own history of racism. Despite these concerns, the gala was a celebration of Black designers, stylists, and celebrities, with many attendees showcasing daring and memorable looks, including Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company expects to offset $1 billion of these costs, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Citing near-term risks, including potential supply chain disruptions and future tariffs, Ford is taking a cautious approach. This tariff impact is less than that of General Motors.</p>

          <p>Israeli Finance Minister Bazalel Smotrich stated that Israel's victory in Gaza requires its complete destruction and the forced displacement of Palestinians to other countries, though his statement does not represent official Israeli government policy. He claimed Israel would control Gaza indefinitely, a day after Netanyahu's government approved a plan to take over Gaza and hold it for an undefined period. The plan, dubbed Operation Gideon's Chariots, would also prevent Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid, which Israel says strengthens the groupâ€™s rule in Gaza. Smotrich said they want their troops to fight against a tired, hungry, and exhausted enemy.</p>

United Airlines announced it would cut 35 flights a day from its New York City area hub at Newark to ease disruptions.

Rocky was found not guilty on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. However, some found Rockyâ€™s inclusion of a gun in his Met Gala look less than three months later to be in bad taste. The article notes that social media users have expressed mixed reactions to the choice, with some calling it 'diabolical' and 'crazy.'</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 race for a North Carolina supreme court seat must remain in the final count, effectively securing an electoral victory for Democrat Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers agreed that removing ballots after the election would violate due process and equal protection rights. The board was ordered to certify results that showed Riggs the winner by just 734 votes over Republican Jefferson Griffin, though the judge delayed his decisions for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling. The article notes that Democrats and voting rights groups raised alarm about Griffinâ€™s efforts.</p>

          <p>A slump in U.S. exports, particularly in the agricultural sector, is linked to the decline in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses across the economy cancel manufacturing orders, sending Chinese factories and freight ships into retreat, as well as changes in global demand linked to U.S. trade policy. The latest trade data shows that a slide in U.S. exports to the world, and China in particular, that began in January now extends to most U.S. ports, according to trade tracker Vizion. This article states that nearly all of U.S. exports have taken a hit. Retailers have been urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, and data from Bank of America Global Research suggests why that may be the right move.</p>

The recent dramatic upward swings in the currency were largely driven by exporters' rush to convert U.S. dollar reserves to the local currency as the U.S. dollar faltered, and life insurers' intensified hedging for their U.S. dollar debt holdings.</p>
