          <p>Federal agents arrested Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrest, stating that Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected agents away from Eduardo Flores Ruiz.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump indicated a willingness to consider military action against Iran if diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions fail. In an interview, Trump stated he would be "leading the pack" to war if a deal couldn't be reached, while also expressing hope for a diplomatic resolution. Trump's comments come as U.S. officials prepare to meet with Iranian counterparts in Oman to discuss Tehran's nuclear program, with Netanyahu pushing for a deal that would leave no trace of Iran's nuclear program. He also expressed optimism about brokering a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia during his upcoming trip to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos faces sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, arguing that Santos remains unrepentant for his crimes and made a mockery of the election system, while his lawyers are requesting a lighter sentence of 24 months. Santos admits to fabricating his biography to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices, but says he is remorseful. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to pay more than $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

The predatory caterpillars are extremely rare, and the bone collectors are known to eat each other.

          <p>Despite his CDU's victory in the German election, Friedrich Merz's personal popularity is declining, with a significant portion of Germans questioning his trustworthiness. This unpopularity stems from his approach to the far-right AfD and perceived U-turns on key policy positions. Merz also faces criticism for his perceived misogyny and unpopularity in eastern Germany. While he aims to address right-wing populism with strong leadership, his actions have so far failed to improve his public image.</p>

          <p>Melody Farris was convicted of murdering her husband, Gary Farris, after his charred remains were found on their property. The case involved a complex family drama with both Melody and her son, Scott, accusing each other of the crime. Melody claims Scott killed his father to inherit the farm and framed her, while Scott maintains his innocence and asserts that Melody is responsible. Despite Melody's accusations, investigators ruled out Scott as a suspect, and he was not charged in connection with his father's death.</p>
