          <p>A 26-year-old former teacher in Michigan, Jocelyn Sanroman, is facing charges of third-degree sexual conduct for an alleged sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student in 2023. The accusations came to light after Sanroman reportedly confided in a colleague, who then alerted the police. Prosecutors have emphasized the breach of trust, highlighting that a teacher's position of authority negates the possibility of legal consent from a minor student. If convicted, Sanroman could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years for exploiting her role as an educator.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, is demanding the immediate closure of the Israeli and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The charities allege that since the GHF began operations, over 500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 4,000 injured while seeking aid, with Israeli forces and armed groups reportedly opening fire on civilians. The groups condemn the GHF for violating humanitarian norms by forcing people into militarized zones and call for a UN-led system to replace it, stating the current situation presents an impossible choice between starvation and violence.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament are set to vote on the government's controversial welfare reform bill, which faces significant opposition from within the ruling Labour Party despite recent concessions. The proposed changes, particularly to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), have sparked a rebellion, although its size has diminished after ministers offered compromises. The Conservative opposition plans to vote against the measures, arguing they do not constitute serious reform and fail to make meaningful savings to the spiraling benefits budget. The government is engaged in a last-minute effort to persuade dissenting MPs ahead of the evening vote.</p>

Al-Hilal secured their victory with a 112th-minute goal from Marcos Leonardo, his second of the match, capitalizing on a moment of defensive disarray from the English champions.

          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, where it will display its most advanced military hardware. While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe its subtext will be a clear message to the self-ruled island. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is expected to feature new fifth-generation fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and carrier-based aircraft, much of which was developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind. The parade and a speech by President Xi Jinping are anticipated to signal the future direction of China's military and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the French film industry for its general failure to depict the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, contrasting it with Hollywood productions like "12 Years a Slave." The author notes that despite France having the second-largest colonial empire, these stories remain largely invisible in the country's collective imagination. The piece highlights recent independent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" as rare exceptions that are finally bringing these narratives to the screen. However, it laments that such films are often marginalized and struggle for mainstream recognition, even as audiences show a readiness to engage with this complex history.</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the need for emerging nations to develop "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. This concept refers to a country's ability to control its own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure, rather than relying on English-centric models from major tech companies. Experts suggested that the ASEAN region is well-positioned for this shift, and that leveraging open-source AI models and democratized access to cloud computing can empower local talent. This approach aims to create a more inclusive global AI landscape and prevent the benefits of the technology from being concentrated in just a few nations.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, indicating expansion, which analysts attribute to a delayed positive response to a U.S.-China tariff reduction announced in May. The survey, which focuses more on smaller, export-oriented firms, noted that improved trade conditions and promotional activities boosted new orders and production. However, new export orders continued to decline and employment in the sector remained weak, suggesting potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The move withholds money intended for teacher training, after-school programs, and support for English learners and students from migrant families. California is set to lose at least $811 million, a move its state superintendent called an "illegal action" that will harm students immediately. The administration's justification aligns with its budget proposal to eliminate or slash these specific programs, but the freeze applies to funds for the current fiscal year that school districts had already factored into their budgets.</p>

          <p>A group of six Republican state legislators from California has sent a letter to President Trump, urging his administration to shift its immigration enforcement focus away from sweeping workplace raids. Led by State Sen. Suzette Valladares, the coalition argues that current ICE tactics are creating widespread fear and causing labor shortages in key industries like construction and hospitality. The letter asks that enforcement prioritize violent criminals rather than non-criminal workers, many of whom have legal status but are fearful. The Republicans also called for streamlining guest worker visa programs to support the state's economy.</p>

Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which formally asserts Manila's maritime claims and has been strongly opposed by Beijing.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills aimed at speeding up construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The legislation, which Newsom pushed through by tying it to the state budget, exempts most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews that often cause delays and litigation. The move sidestepped demands from some powerful labor groups for broader wage requirements, applying them only to high-rise and low-income developments. Experts believe the new laws could represent the most consequential changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unlocking numerous stalled housing projects.</p>

Prime Minister Carney stated the decision was part of a "bigger negotiation," and trade talks between the two countries have since resumed.

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for California's wildfire season. The troops were federalized by President Trump to address protests, a controversial move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was illegal and depleted firefighting resources. The state had previously warned that the deployment left its Guard-based firefighting force at only 40% capacity ahead of an expected early and active fire season. The proposal to reassign some troops comes amid an ongoing legal battle between the state and the Trump administration over control of the Guard.</p>

It achieves this by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with the body's inflammatory response. These findings help explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and may lead to new strategies that simulate its effects.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged that the advancement of generative artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to the automation of certain tasks, resulting in fewer employees being needed for those specific jobs. In an interview, he stated that like all technological transformations, some roles will be eliminated, but new ones will be created in areas like AI and robotics. Jassy framed the shift as an opportunity to free employees from "rote work" and make their jobs more interesting and inventive.
