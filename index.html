          <p>Seven men in Rochdale have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period, with the victims being groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves." The abusers, some of whom worked on the town's market or as taxi drivers, plied the girls with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. One of the victims stated that she believed she may have been preyed upon by hundreds of men. The police stated that the way the victims were dealt with at the time was indefensible and inexcusable, and that they have since improved on how these investigations are managed. The NSPCC emphasized the need for children to be able to speak out and for adults to educate themselves on the signs of grooming.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, prompting retaliatory drone launches from Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the goal was to diminish the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, while Iranian President Mahsoud Pezeshkian vowed strong action against Israel. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte urged de-escalation, stating the region was "not close" to a nuclear conflict. The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel. The exchange of attacks has raised concerns about an escalating regional conflict and the fate of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

The sole survivor, a British national, described the moment the plane crashed, stating that he didn't know how he survived.

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump urged Iran to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program, warning of further death and destruction if a deal is not reached. Trump stated that Iran should "make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire." Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed that the U.S. was not involved in the Israeli airstrikes, but cautioned Iran against targeting U.S. interests. The Israeli Prime Minister dubbed the attack "Operation Rising Lion," stating it was targeted to eliminate the Iranian threat. Iran retaliated by launching over 100 drones at Israel, prompting Israeli air defenses to intercept the threats.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the rise of the "tech right," exemplified by figures like Elon Musk, and their disillusionment with the Trump administration. Initially, some in the tech world hoped Trump would deliver deregulation, tax cuts, and an anti-woke agenda. However, the administration's actions, including tariffs and unsteady stock markets, failed to align with their priorities. The author suggests that the Democrats should consider how to win back these voters as Trump's coalition fractures. The piece also touches on the cultural shift in the Bay Area tech scene, noting a backlash against what the author considers an intense woke movement.</p>

A federal judge previously ruled that Trump's deployment of the troops to Los Angeles to quell immigration raids was illegal. The appeals court said it would hold a hearing on Tuesday.</p>

Lawyers representing families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law.

          <p>Despite rising tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Disrupting oil flows would likely trigger further retaliation and could draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Experts also suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows may be physically impossible. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments.</p>

The Angels focus on drafting polished college players who can quickly reach the majors, reducing minor league development costs.

The Angels' method could embolden owners to eliminate more minor league teams.</p>
