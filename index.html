          <p>China Telecom Quantum Group has launched what it claims is the world's first commercial cryptography system resistant to hacking, even by quantum computers. The system integrates Quantum Key Distribution, which uses quantum mechanics for secure key transmission, and Post-Quantum Cryptography, which employs complex mathematical problems to protect data. This combination creates an end-to-end quantum-secure architecture for real-time communication, data protection, and identity authentication. According to Peng Chengzhi, a chief quantum scientist at China Telecom, public key-based encryption systems face increasing threats from advancements in quantum computing.</p>

          <p>The UK's strawberry season is off to a "stonking start" due to warm days and cool nights, resulting in sweeter than usual fruit. According to growers, the favorable conditions have led to a good crop with good size and exceptional sweetness. Warm days and cool nights allow the strawberries to rest and channel energy into producing natural sugars. Farmers are also implementing irrigation systems to mitigate potential drought effects, ensuring a steady water supply for their crops, which bodes well for consumers looking to enjoy the flavors of summer.</p>

Bale was inspired by the idea of children without parents, and has been working with Tim McCormick, a veteran of foster homes in Chicago. The village will house foster siblings in individual houses around a central garden, where they're cared for by trained foster parents. Bale hopes the village will foster authentic goodness and change the narrative of society's care for children.</p>
