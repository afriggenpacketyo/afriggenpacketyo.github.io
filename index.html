          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant drop of 16% following escalating tensions between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The conflict arose after Trump threatened to withdraw government contracts from Musk's companies in response to Musk's criticism of a spending bill. Trump claimed Musk was upset about the removal of electric vehicle credits from the bill, while Musk accused Trump of "ingratitude" and asserted his importance in Trump's election victory. This public dispute has negatively impacted investor confidence in Tesla, leading to the sharp decline in its stock price.

          <p>Experts suggest that President Trump's new travel ban, impacting 12 countries, appears designed to avoid legal pitfalls encountered by his previous attempts. The ban targets countries mainly in the Middle East, Africa, and the Caribbean, with restrictions graded against perceived threats, including terrorism. Legal experts note that the new ban is more legally robust and wider in scope compared to the original, which faced challenges for allegedly discriminating against travelers based on religion. The new ban has a more comprehensive approach that seems likely to be upheld by the Supreme Court if challenged.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit brought by Mexico against U.S. gun manufacturers, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). Mexico had argued that the gunmakers' practices contributed to the flow of illegal guns to Mexican drug cartels. The court's decision upholds the PLCAA, which shields gun manufacturers from liability for the misuse of their products. The ruling is based on the court's conclusion that Mexico failed to prove the gunmakers aided and abetted illegal sales.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked a lawsuit brought by Mexico that sought to hold American gunmakers accountable for their role in the country's struggle with drug cartels. The court voted 9-0 to reject the suit, upholding a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability if weapons they produce are misused. Mexico had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border is a result of "deliberate" practices by US firms that they say appealed to cartel members with their products. The court found that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers.</p>
