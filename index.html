          <p>Parts of the Western and Plains states are facing significant flood threats this weekend due to heavy rainfall from monsoonal moisture, with some areas in New Mexico and Texas under a Level 2 of 4 threat for excessive rainfall. Communities like Ruidoso, New Mexico, are on high alert for flooding near recent wildfire burn scars, adding to the region's weather challenges. Meanwhile, Southern Florida continues to experience hot and stormy conditions, though the heaviest rainfall has likely passed after a week of intense downpours. The rest of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a return to warmer, above-average temperatures, diminishing the recent fall-like weather.</p>

          <p>Central London saw a major mobilization as over 100,000 people participated in a "Unite the Kingdom" rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, featuring a video address from Elon Musk calling for a new election. A counter-protest by Stand Up To Racism drew an estimated 5,000 demonstrators, prompting a significant police presence to prevent clashes between the groups. The Metropolitan Police reported nine arrests and described "significant aggression," with officers being assaulted with projectiles from the Robinson rally. The event highlights ongoing tensions in the UK surrounding issues of nationalism, immigration, and free speech.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, ESPN personality Pat McAfee delivered a powerful, patriotic message during a live broadcast of "College GameDay." Addressing the crowd at the University of Tennessee, McAfee emphasized unity, stating that despite political and social divisions, events like college football bring Americans from all backgrounds together. He celebrated the sport as a unifying force in what he called the "greatest country on Earth," prompting chants of "U-S-A" from the audience. His comments were framed as a call to remember shared values and celebrate community during a week marked by political turmoil.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and ally of President Donald Trump, was assassinated at age 31 during a speaking event for his organization, Turning Point USA. Kirk was a highly influential yet polarizing figure, known for his daily podcast and campus debates on topics like gun control, faith, and gender, which often drew strong liberal criticism. He founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to organize young conservatives, and it grew into one of the most powerful youth political organizations, playing a key role in voter registration and mobilization for the MAGA movement. His death has been mourned by supporters as the loss of a key voice for conservative youth in America.</p>

          <h2>California Passes AI Bill Requiring Transparency on Catastrophic Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 11:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill requiring developers of powerful "frontier" AI models to publish detailed safety and security reports addressing potential catastrophic risks. These risks are defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled bioweapons or critical infrastructure cyberattacks.

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has stated that if elected, he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes should he ever visit the city. Mamdani's pledge is based on an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued for Netanyahu over Israel's military actions in Gaza. Legal experts, however, note that such an action would be practically impossible and create a direct conflict with the federal government, as the U.S. does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction. The statement has drawn significant attention in a city with the world's second-largest Jewish population.</p>

The caller, who earns significantly more and holds all the retirement assets, wants to sell their rental properties, pay off their mortgage, and downsize, but her husband is not on board. Host Dave Ramsey and his co-host Dr. John Delony identified the issue as a deep marital disconnect rather than a simple financial problem, characterizing their dynamic as that of roommates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical professor of dermatology is advising consumers to pay close attention to the ingredients in popular lip oils, as some may cause adverse skin reactions like hyperpigmentation. The thin skin on lips is highly susceptible to sun damage, and oils without broad-spectrum SPF can magnify UV exposure, leading to darkened skin. Irritants found in some plumping ingredients and fragrances like peppermint or citrus can also cause dermatitis, which may result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. To use lip oils safely, consumers should look for products with SPF and hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid while avoiding fragrances and certain oleic acids.</p>

          <h2>The Mysterious Origins of Jeffrey Epstein's Vast Fortune</h2>

          <p>Despite his immense wealth, the precise sources of Jeffrey Epstein's nearly $600 million fortune remain ambiguous, though it was largely built by managing the finances of billionaires Les Wexner and Leon Black. Newly revealed emails illustrate his role in connecting powerful political and business figures, creating spheres of influence through access and lavish gifts. Epstein's wealth grew dramatically in the late 1990s, and he collected at least $490 million in fees from Wexner and Black for tax and estate planning services. His connections also made him a valuable, if unofficial, client developer for institutions like JPMorgan Chase, which continued to service his accounts despite internal red flags.</p>

          <p>Recent ICE raids under the Trump administration are evoking painful memories for Americans whose families were impacted by past xenophobic U.S. immigration policies. The article draws parallels between current events and historical episodes like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the mass deportation of nearly two million Mexican Americans during the Great Depression. Survivors and their descendants share stories of family separation and generational trauma, highlighting how cycles of anti-immigrant sentiment have repeatedly manifested in U.S. history. They express a mix of anger and hope, noting that while racism persists, there is greater public awareness and support for immigrants today.</p>

By introducing innovative flavors and revamping marketing, Hershman has increased same-store sales by over 10% and grown the chain to 40 locations, with systemwide sales reaching $20.6 million in 2024.

          <p>The American dictionary industry is facing a crisis as digital platforms and changing consumer habits erode its traditional business model. While access to definitions is easier than ever, legacy publishers like Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com are struggling against Google's search algorithms and the proliferation of free, often unreliable sources. Dictionary.com recently laid off its entire full-time lexicography staff after being sold, highlighting the financial unsustainability of maintaining expert-driven content. The number of professional lexicographers in the U.S. has plummeted, raising concerns about who will serve as the watchdog for language in an era of intense political and social discourse.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has suspended eight officers and one staff member following a BBC investigation into alleged misconduct at Charing Cross police station. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is now investigating allegations that include excessive force, discriminatory comments, and failure to report inappropriate behavior. This incident recalls a 2022 IOPC report that uncovered "disgraceful" racist and misogynistic behavior at the same station, which contributed to the resignation of the former commissioner. A Met Assistant Commissioner described the new allegations as "disgraceful" and announced immediate steps to dismantle and reform the station's custody team.</p>

          <p>The UK government is under fire for its handling of revelations about Lord Mandelson's friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Mandelson's dismissal as US ambassador. Questions are being raised about the thoroughness of the vetting processes conducted by both the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office prior to his appointment. Sources suggest Prime Minister Keir Starmer had specifically questioned Mandelson about his ties to Epstein, but the ambassador's responses are now being described as "economical with the truth." The scandal has undermined the prime minister's authority and created a significant political embarrassment just days before a state visit from President Trump.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have escalated their assault on Gaza City, relying heavily on aerial bombardments that have destroyed entire apartment blocks and triggered a new wave of civilian displacement. The Israeli military has warned all residents to evacuate south, stating that approximately 250,000 people have already left ahead of an anticipated ground offensive in what it calls Hamas's last major stronghold. The intensification has drawn international condemnation, with the UN warning of a deepening humanitarian catastrophe. Meanwhile, Qatar has strongly criticized Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu following a recent Israeli strike on Hamas officials in Doha.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The late far-right activist Charlie Kirk played a pivotal role in transforming U.S. higher education into a central arena for the culture wars. Through his organization Turning Point USA, Kirk pioneered a confrontational style of campus activism, targeting what he saw as leftist indoctrination and galvanizing conservative students with a narrative of persecution. He popularized on-campus debates as a form of political combat and created a "professor watchlist" to target faculty with opposing views. This approach helped pave the way for a broader conservative assault on universities, making his brand of ideological warfare a key feature of the modern political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Charlie Kirk's Assassination Highlights America's Enduring Stalemate on Gun Control</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 09:00:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk and a nearly simultaneous school shooting in Colorado underscore the pervasive nature of gun violence in the United States. Despite the shock surrounding Kirk's death, who was himself a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, there has been little substantive discussion about gun control reform. Kirk had previously argued that gun deaths were a worthwhile cost for the freedom to own firearms for defense against a tyrannical government. This perspective reflects a hardened political landscape where tragedies often fail to shift the entrenched debate, leaving the nation in a stalemate on gun policy.</p>
