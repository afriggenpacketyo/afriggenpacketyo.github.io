          <h2>Trump's UK Trade Deal Signals 10% Baseline Tariffs Are Here to Stay</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal that includes a 10% tariff on most goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., with exceptions for specific sectors like autos, steel, and aluminum. This deal, the first since President Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs, suggests that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners. Analysts believe that this deal signals more flexibility on sectoral tariffs but indicates that tariff-free agreements are unlikely under Trump's administration. The agreement allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, while steel and aluminum exports are tariff-free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese government data indicates that trade flows are being reordered due to the trade war between the United States and China. In April, Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21% as President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, but exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21%. Overall shipments of goods from China jumped by 8.1% in April compared with a year earlier, reflecting factories rushing to ship goods before further trade escalations. Economists warn that unemployment could spike if declining factory orders force companies to fire workers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Migratory birds, crucial for maintaining ecosystem balance through pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control, are increasingly impacted by climate change. Rising global temperatures and extreme weather events are altering their migration routes and behaviors. Changes to coastal habitats and ocean acidification affect the availability of food sources, threatening their survival and reproductive success. While some species adapt by expending more energy, others struggle, leading to potential conflicts with resident animals and even extinction, highlighting the need for conservation efforts and international treaties to protect these vital species.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day commemorations with a military parade in Red Square, featuring heightened security measures following recent Ukrainian strikes.

China's Xi Jinping attended the event, underscoring the deepening ties between the two nations, and sat alongside Vladimir Putin on the platform in Red Square. Despite a unilateral ceasefire declared by Russia, Ukraine reported thousands of attacks since it came into effect, rejecting the truce as a theatrical show.</p>

Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped.
