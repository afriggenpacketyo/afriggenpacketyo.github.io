          <p>Israel initiated a series of airstrikes targeting locations in Iran allegedly connected to its nuclear program, resulting in the deaths of key Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. Among those killed were Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, and Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, vowed to retaliate for the attacks, raising concerns about a wider conflict. In response, Iran launched approximately 100 drones toward Israeli territory, which Israel is attempting to intercept; these events have triggered market instability and heightened geopolitical tensions.

          <p>The High Court has rejected a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1st across the UK. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law, but the court found that the policy was enacted by Parliament after full debate and was a manifesto commitment. The court acknowledged that the legislation would affect some families' ability to afford private school, including those with children with special educational needs, but deemed that the government was entitled to prioritize revenue raising for public services. The government estimates the policy will generate Â£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 for state sector improvements. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing a comprehensive plan to adapt to increasing rainfall and flooding caused by climate change. The city's "Cloudburst Management Plan," a $1.3 billion public works project, includes constructing rain tunnels and "sponge parks" to manage excess water. The Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel, a mile-long underground tunnel, will store excess rainwater, while Enghaveparken, a redesigned park, can transform into a reservoir during heavy rain. Copenhagen is also building a human-made island, Lynetteholm, to protect against storm surges, making the city a global leader in climate adaptation strategies.
