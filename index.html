          <p>A 41-year-old man, Louis Geri, was arrested outside the Cathedral of Saint Matthew the Apostle in Washington, D.C., on Sunday morning, facing charges of unlawful entry, making threats, and possessing a Molotov cocktail. Police, who were already on site for a special Mass, found Geri pitching a tent and discovered multiple suspicious items. This incident occurred just a week after a deadly attack at a church in Michigan, highlighting heightened concerns about security at religious venues. Federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF, are investigating, though authorities have confirmed there is no current threat to public safety following the arrest. The cathedral was preparing for its annual Red Mass, traditionally attended by Supreme Court justices and other public officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is actively encouraging skilled professionals to return from the US, following President Trump's significant hike in H-1B visa fees to $100,000, prompting discussions about engineering a reverse brain drain. Policymakers in Delhi view this as a prime opportunity to attract talented individuals in technology and medicine back to the country, aiming for them to contribute to nation-building. While some Indians, like Nithin Hassan, have already made the leap, finding immigration status in the US limiting, experts caution that luring hundreds of thousands back will be challenging without a more concerted government effort. The article notes a surge in inquiries from non-resident Indians exploring relocation, fueled by US immigration policy shifts and the growth of Global Capability Centres in India. However, critics argue the current government lacks the serious, top-down strategy needed for mass reverse migration, contrasting it with past successful efforts.</p>

          <p>Nearly four million pounds of Foster Farms chicken corn dog products have been recalled across the nation due to contamination concerns after pieces of wood were found embedded in the batter, resulting in at least five reported consumer injuries. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service issued the recall following numerous consumer complaints. The affected items, produced between July 30, 2024, and August 4, 2025, were distributed to retail stores and institutional locations, including Department of Defense and USDA Commodity Foods programs. This article highlights that while the products reached schools, it was through commercial sales, not the National School Lunch Program. This incident marks the second corn dog recall in a month for similar reasons, underscoring ongoing food safety challenges in the industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled significant housing market reforms designed to reduce costs, shorten transaction delays, and halve the number of failed property sales, aiming to benefit hundreds of thousands of families and first-time buyers. Housing Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that these changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and cutting up to four weeks from the typical property transaction timeline. Core proposals include a legal requirement for sellers and estate agents to provide key upfront information, such as home condition and leasehold costs, to enhance transparency and buyer confidence. The article also notes the potential introduction of binding contracts to deter late withdrawals, a measure estimated to save the UK economy £1.5 billion annually by reducing collapsed deals.</p>

While manager Arne Slot might be allowing Salah to conserve energy for offensive plays, the tactical issue lies with the players positioned behind him, who are not adequately covering, resulting in vulnerable 2v1 overloads on the right flank. This defensive vulnerability was highlighted in Liverpool's recent defeat to Chelsea, suggesting that astute opponents could increasingly exploit this space. The article emphasizes that the concern is not primarily Salah's goal-scoring form, which is expected to rebound, but rather Liverpool's overall struggle to maintain control and defensive solidity in games this season, contrasting with their previous campaign under Slot.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that US forces struck another vessel illegally carrying drugs off Venezuela's coast, stating that land-based drug trafficking would also become a focus. Speaking at a US Navy anniversary ceremony, Trump asserted the navy's role in "blowing the cartel terrorists the hell out of the water," claiming such boats are now non-existent. However, the United Nations has previously condemned similar US strikes, labeling them "extrajudicial executions" and emphasizing that criminal activities should be addressed through due process and international cooperation. This article also highlights the context of an ongoing federal government shutdown affecting military personnel's pay and recent controversial directives from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, including an end to "woke" culture and the implementation of "gender-neutral" physical fitness standards focused solely on "warfighting."</p>

          <p>Martin Powers, a historian, highlights how studying Chinese art offers unique insights into imperial China's political and social history, often revealing widespread societal understandings not always explicit in written texts. He provides an example of a recurring story in various art forms, depicting a Han dynasty prime minister respecting local jurisdiction, which signifies a well-understood concept of governance in China. The article argues that art actively "participates" in political debate, serving as a medium to convey ideas about societal power structures and intergroup relations. Powers draws parallels between aristocratic images of dominant figures in Chinese art, symbolizing arbitrary privilege, and the concept of "honour" discussed by the French political philosopher Montesquieu, suggesting a surprising resonance of ancient political ideas in contemporary Western societies.</p>

          <p>Japanese shares are projected to continue their record-setting rally, while the nation's currency and bonds are expected to weaken, following Sanae Takaichi's election as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Takaichi, known for her expansionist fiscal and monetary policies, similar to the "Abenomics" stimulus, is considered a "positive surprise" for stock prices, with the Nikkei potentially surging towards the 47,000 level. Conversely, her victory is likely to exert negative pressure on longer-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and the yen, as markets anticipate looser fiscal and monetary stances. The article notes that the Bank of Japan's efforts to raise interest rates and shrink its balance sheet could be complicated by Takaichi's strong mandate, which may influence monetary policy decisions, potentially leading to a steeper yield curve for JGBs.

This article highlights that a new generation of investors, often disregarding traditional metrics, are fueling speculative surges in future-oriented sectors like data centers, biotech, and quantum computing. Cramer emphasizes the extraordinary performance of companies like Nvidia, attributing its success to its foundational role in the fourth industrial revolution. Despite this "year of magical investing," Cramer advises investors to take some profits off the table, especially when stocks have seen significant gains, to prepare for an eventual market correction.

          <p>The UK Conservatives are poised to unveil proposals for £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years, targeting welfare, foreign aid, and the civil service, with Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride emphasizing the need to curb unsustainable spending. Key measures include ending welfare claims for individuals with "low-level mental health problems," reducing civil servant numbers by approximately 132,000 (a quarter of the current total), and cutting aid spending by £7 billion to 0.1% of national income. The article highlights the party's intention to maintain the two-child benefit cap, a policy criticized by Labour for increasing child poverty. While some think tanks, like the Institute for Economic Affairs, support aspects of the plan, they caution that the proposals largely avoid the "elephant in the room" of age-related spending, such as pensions, which remain protected.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that China, having held the position of the world's largest exporter for the past 16 years, must now strategically pivot its economic focus to become the world's largest importer within the next five to ten years. This proposed shift, slated for deliberation during the upcoming 15th five-year plan, is deemed imperative for accelerating China's transition towards a consumption-driven economy. The article emphasizes that this reorientation aims to address long-standing structural imbalances that have historically prioritized investment and exports over domestic demand. Achieving this new goal of "consumed in China" would signify a pivotal evolution in the nation's economic strategy, carrying profound geopolitical and economic implications for China, its key trading partners, and the broader global economy.</p>

The alarm was raised late Thursday when the men failed to return from their expedition. Over 100 volunteers from various rescue associations participated in the "long and difficult" operation, which was severely hampered by rapidly worsening weather, significant flooding, and rough underground terrain. This article explains that by the time rescuers located the men early Friday, rising water levels had rendered their simplest exit impassable, forcing them to retrace their steps through increasingly dangerous conditions. Despite the arduous circumstances, all three men were brought to safety, uninjured but severely exhausted after being cold and wet for 42 hours, with rescue efforts finally concluding Saturday morning.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were fatally shot, and twelve others injured, including seven under the age of 17, when gunfire erupted late Saturday night at an intersection near downtown Montgomery, Alabama. Police Chief James Graboys identified the deceased as 17-year-old Jeremiah Morris and 43-year-old Sholanda Williams, noting that five victims were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries. Preliminary investigations suggest the violence escalated when an individual targeted in the shooting returned fire, prompting multiple people in the gathered crowd to draw weapons and open fire as well. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed characterized the incident as a "disagreement that could have been avoided," and a $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. No arrests have been announced in this tragic mass shooting.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced his intent to seek a court order to block President Trump's deployment of 300 California National Guard troops to Oregon, labeling the action a "breathtaking abuse" of power. This decision follows a federal judge in Oregon having temporarily blocked the federalization of that state's National Guard, ruling that Trump's justification for deployment was "untethered to the facts." Constitutional law experts consider Trump's move a clear, unprecedented attempt to circumvent the judge's ruling by deploying one state's Guard to another without the consent of either governor. This article highlights Newsom's escalating rhetoric against Trump, accusing the commander-in-chief of using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens and emphasizing that this "isn't about public safety, it's about power."</p>
