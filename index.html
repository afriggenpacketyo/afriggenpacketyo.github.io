          <p>Since taking control of the newly merged Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has moved quickly to reshape the company's strategy. Key initiatives include a massive $7.7 billion deal to secure exclusive U.S. rights for the UFC, making its events available on Paramount+. Ellison is also greenlighting new franchises, such as a film based on the 'Call of Duty' video game, and is reportedly preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. These aggressive investments in sports and content aim to reverse years of underinvestment and reposition Paramount as a major player in the entertainment industry.</p>

The twins believe there is still significant room for growth, stating that from its current price of over $115,000, there is 'easily a 10x from here.' (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NATO aircraft have engaged and shot down armed Russian drones that violated the airspace of an allied nation, Poland. The incident, involving Polish and Dutch fighter jets, prompted strong condemnation from European leaders but a more equivocal response from U.S. President Donald Trump. The incursion is seen by analysts as a deliberate test by Russia to gauge NATO's response and sow division within the alliance. The event has intensified calls for a significant increase in investment in European air and missile defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site in Georgia, which resulted in the detention of over 300 Korean workers, may have been prompted by serious workplace safety concerns. The investigation reportedly began around the time of the second of three fatal accidents at the site in two years, raising questions about whether the presence of undocumented workers discouraged safety complaints for fear of deportation. The raid has created diplomatic and economic uncertainty between the U.S. and South Korea, potentially delaying the plant's completion and impacting future investments.</p>

          <p>With the Social Security trust fund projected to be depleted in about eight years, this article explores reform options that avoid disproportionately harming poorer Americans. A key issue is that raising the retirement age for everyone is a regressive policy, as lower-income individuals have shorter life expectancies and thus receive benefits for fewer years. A proposed solution from the Brookings Institution suggests a targeted approach: raise the retirement age only for the top 40 percent of earners. This, combined with other progressive benefit adjustments and tax hikes, could ensure the program's solvency.</p>

Another frequent mistake is 'chasing performance' by investing in funds based solely on strong past returns, which are not guaranteed to continue.

          <h2>Analysis: Teacher Evaluations Contribute to Grade Inflation and Reduced Rigor in Universities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the widespread use of student teacher evaluations in American universities has created a perverse incentive structure that fuels grade inflation and reduces academic rigor. Because these scores can significantly impact professors' careers, including hiring, pay, and tenure decisions, faculty are pressured to lighten workloads and award higher grades to receive positive evaluations. Research shows little to no correlation between high evaluation scores and actual student learning. This dynamic has led to an equilibrium where, as one professor noted, 'we give them all A’s, and they give us all fives.'</p>

          <p>Since its full-scale invasion, Russia has abducted tens of thousands of children from occupied Ukrainian territories, placing them in orphanages or with Russian families in a practice Ukraine calls a war crime. While Russia denies the abductions, claiming it 'rescued' the children, international pressure is mounting for their return, which Ukraine has made a precondition for any peace deal. Verifying the exact number of children is difficult, but humanitarian groups are working to repatriate them, a slow process requiring relatives to navigate complex legal systems in both countries.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy stagnated in July, recording zero growth according to the Office for National Statistics. The flat performance was largely driven by the biggest contraction in the manufacturing sector in a year, which offset modest growth in the services sector. These figures highlight a continued economic slowdown and increase pressure on the government to boost growth ahead of the November Budget. The data also presents a complex picture for the Bank of England as it weighs flagging growth against persistent inflation in its upcoming interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI's handling of the initial investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination has drawn criticism, particularly regarding its social media communications. This article analyzes how FBI Director Kash Patel, a pro-Trump influencer before his appointment, made a premature announcement of a suspect's capture, only for the official account to retract it later. This incident is framed within a broader pattern of what critics call an 'influencer hour' at the bureau, where the need for quick online engagement appears to conflict with the traditional restraint and precision required for sensitive law enforcement operations, potentially undermining public trust.</p>

          <p>The holiday shopping season has started unusually early this year, as consumers express nervousness about persistent inflation and President Trump's tariff agenda. According to a Deloitte survey, many shoppers began buying for the holidays as early as July to take advantage of sales events and spread out costs. Retail sales are projected to rise by about 3% this season, a slower pace than the 4.2% growth seen last year. Retailers have also ordered inventory earlier than usual to guard against potential price shocks from tariffs on imported goods.</p>

These risks are defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled bioweapons or large-scale cyberattacks. The bill represents a significant state-level effort to regulate fast-moving AI technology before potential large-scale harms can occur, setting a possible precedent for national policy.</p>

          <p>The UK prime minister is facing growing anger from within the Labour Party over the handling of Peter Mandelson's appointment and subsequent dismissal as ambassador to the United States. Mandelson was sacked after new information emerged regarding his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The episode, described as a 'shambles' by one MP, has led to calls for the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, to be held accountable for the controversial appointment. The chaotic week has reportedly eroded trust and left many in the party feeling despondent.</p>
