        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. This translates to a Â£129 reduction in the typical annual bill, reflecting a fall in international wholesale gas prices. However, charities emphasize that many people still struggle with energy costs and owe suppliers billions. The announcement follows recent debates about winter fuel payments, with the government considering expanding eligibility for pensioners.</p>

          <p>Banana producer Chiquita announced it would lay off thousands of workers in Panama following what it called an "unjustified abandonment of work" that began in late April.

This creates a climate of doubt and prejudice, feeding into the age-old grievance that someone has a job that could have been yours.

This has drawn criticism for undermining important bilateral discussions and promoting misleading information about the situation in South Africa, where xenophobia is primarily directed at poor migrants from other African countries.</p>
