          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a 2018 hotel room incident. The judge ruled that the testimony of the complainant was not "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The players, who were with the NHL when the allegations emerged, remain ineligible to play pending a league review of the verdict. The case, which centered on the issue of consent, has drawn significant public attention across Canada.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams, at 45 years old, was defeated by Magdalena Frech in the DC Open, ending her attempt to secure her first back-to-back tour wins since 2019. This loss followed a significant victory earlier in the week, where she became the oldest woman to win a tour-level singles match since 2004. Williams had recently returned to the sport after a long absence due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, she received a standing ovation from the crowd, acknowledging her enduring presence and impact on the sport.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the cost of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters during a joint visit to the construction site. Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining the president was including a separate building completed five years ago. Despite the friction and past criticism, Trump stated he does not think firing Powell is necessary but reiterated his desire for lower interest rates. The exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the White House and the independent central bank.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. Macron framed the decision as part of a broader effort to achieve a just peace, calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and massive humanitarian aid. The move was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it "rewards terror." This decision places France at the forefront of a contentious international diplomatic issue.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient who has lived in the U.S. since he was 14 is facing deportation to El Salvador after he says he made a wrong turn and accidentally drove into Mexico. The man, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, was detained by border officials when he tried to immediately re-enter the U.S., with the government now claiming he "self-deported." His attorney states he was in Mexico for less than 30 minutes and that his case highlights the lack of leniency under the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies. His wife is currently pregnant and due to give birth in California.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, leading to multiple rescues and road closures. The area, which is vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from past wildfires, has been hit by repeated storms this summer. This event comes less than three weeks after massive floods in the same community killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. Videos shared by residents showed powerful, muddy water destroying property and toppling trees, highlighting the ongoing danger faced by the community during the summer rainy season.</p>

          <p>The 2028 presidential race appears to be unofficially underway as several potential Democratic candidates, including Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom, increase their media visibility. These figures are appearing on a diverse range of podcasts and shows, seemingly in an effort to reach new audiences and differentiate themselves after the party's 2024 loss. The article notes a rhetorical shift, with some candidates taking more moderate or centrist positions on cultural issues. This early maneuvering indicates that potential contenders are not wasting time in a party now facing a leadership vacuum.</p>

          <p>A record-breaking heatwave is affecting Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record from 1972. The extreme heat, which scientists link to the accelerating pace of climate change, is causing problems for the region's tourism and its famous reindeer. Tourists are puzzled by the hot weather, while reindeer are fleeing to roads to escape mosquitoes that thrive in the heat. The article highlights the tangible impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing a final hurdle for the deal. The approval followed Paramount's controversial $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and commitments from Skydance to address conservative grievances and appoint a news ombudsman. The decision drew a sharp dissent from the FCC's lone Democrat, who called it a capitulation that erodes press freedom. The deal has been linked to the recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that major technology companies are not overspending on artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the AI race is a "winner-take-all" situation, and companies must invest heavily to secure a dominant position, pointing to Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures as justification. While acknowledging skepticism due to current chatbot inaccuracies, Cramer believes the technology will improve and that the company with the most accurate AI could achieve a near-monopoly.

          <p>As regulators, particularly the US FDA, move to ban or phase out artificial food colorings like Red Dye No. 3, companies are accelerating their search for natural alternatives.

While natural colors can be more expensive and present challenges in stability and vividness, major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to reformulate their products. This shift reflects growing consumer and regulatory pressure to remove synthetic chemicals from the food supply.</p>

Abdallah was convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders of an American and an Israeli diplomat in Paris. Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, which supporters attribute to U.S. and Israeli pressure. His case remained a cause célèbre for the far-left, and his release marks the end of a decades-long, politically charged imprisonment.</p>

The diplomatic effort aims to revive negotiations that stalled after the U.S. and Israel bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June. Iran is seeking security guarantees, while the Europeans are pushing for verifiable limits on its enrichment.</p>
