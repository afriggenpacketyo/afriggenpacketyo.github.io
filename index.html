        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global companies are increasingly looking to India as a manufacturing alternative to China due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and supply chain vulnerabilities. Companies like Apple and Google are expanding their production in India, with Foxconn committing $1.5 billion to expand its iPhone facility and Google planning to assemble Pixel smartphones there. This shift is part of a broader realignment across sectors, including electric vehicles and aerospace, driven by geopolitics, economics, and strategy. While India faces challenges such as logistical bottlenecks and regulatory red tape, its large labor force and government incentives make it an appealing choice for companies looking to diversify.

          <p>President Trump initially rescinded Republican Senator Rand Paul's invitation to the annual White House congressional picnic due to Paul's opposition to the GOP-backed budget bill, but later reversed course. Paul criticized the White House's action as "incredibly petty," stating that he believed he was the only senator to be uninvited. Trump then announced on Truth Social that Paul and his family were welcome to attend, humorously noting it would give him more time to secure Paul's vote on the bill. This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between the White House and some Republican lawmakers over fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has taken a more negative stance on nuclear talks with Iran, announcing the withdrawal of some U.S. personnel from the Middle East, leading to a spike in oil prices. Trump accused Tehran of "delaying" and expressed less confidence in reaching a deal, while Tehran accused Washington of not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium. The IAEA Board of Governors declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, increasing the risk of military action by Israel. The main point of contention is Iran's domestic uranium enrichment, which Trump now deems unacceptable, raising concerns about potential conflict. </p>

          <p>Meta is suing Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to create nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals. The Hong Kong-based company ran ads on Facebook and Instagram promoting the app, which allows users to upload a photo and generate a nude image of the subject. Meta's lawsuit aims to stop Joy Timeline from advertising on its platforms, following multiple attempts to circumvent Meta's ad review process. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove these types of ads.</p>

          <p>The global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. The resolution, supported by 19 of 35 countries, cites Iran's failures to provide full answers about its undeclared nuclear material and activities. The IAEA also expressed concern about Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, which could be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran has condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility. </p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increased demand for nuclear power, driven by power-hungry AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium, but the Biden administration has banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic enrichment capacity. Despite this support, experts say the U.S. will continue to depend on other countries for uranium, as domestic reserves are limited. Uranium mining companies are working to restart and ramp up domestic production to meet the growing demand. </p>
