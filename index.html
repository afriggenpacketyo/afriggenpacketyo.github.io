          <p>Copenhagen Airport experienced a temporary shutdown following reports of drone activity in the vicinity, leading to flight suspensions and diversions. Danish police were unable to confirm the origin, type, or number of drones involved, initiating an investigation into the incident. The airport has since reopened, but passengers are advised to expect potential delays and cancellations as airlines work to normalize operations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alluded to a potential Russian link to the incident, though this remains unconfirmed by authorities. This event underscores the increasing challenges and security concerns posed by unauthorized drone activity near critical infrastructure. The situation highlights the need for enhanced drone detection and mitigation strategies at airports. Optimism score is based on the reopening of the airport and ongoing investigation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump advised pregnant women to avoid Tylenol due to a disputed link between the drug's active ingredient, paracetamol, and autism. This announcement was made alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who stated that the FDA will issue a notice to physicians and initiate a safety label change for Tylenol. Tylenol maker Kenvue strongly refuted the claim, asserting that independent science shows no causal relationship between acetaminophen and autism, and warning against the health risks of pregnant women forgoing a safe pain relief option. Experts also pushed back against Trump's claims, citing a lack of robust evidence supporting a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. This comes amid broader discussions about rising autism rates and potential environmental factors. </p>

          <p>Stephen Miller's eulogy for Charlie Kirk has drawn criticism for its divisive rhetoric, portraying Trump's supporters as embodiments of good and his opponents as evil. The speech, delivered as a battle cry for the Trump administration's agenda, has been interpreted as an antithesis to Obama's call for unity, instead emphasizing division and subjugation. Miller's remarks were seen as an attempt to delegitimize the opposition, using Kirk's death as a pretext. The speech amplified existing tensions, further polarizing the American political landscape, and contrasting sharply with calls for reconciliation following past tragedies. The article reflects on the potential dangers of such rhetoric and its impact on national unity. </p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne, known for shows like Adolescence, commended the journalists who uncovered the phone hacking scandal in the media, ahead of his new TV series, The Hack. Thorne emphasizes the importance of journalism in holding its own industry accountable, drawing a contrast with the Post Office scandal where journalism struggled to gain traction. The Hack explores the complex relationship between the press, politics, and the police through the perspectives of a journalist and a detective. Thorne also mentioned his previous work, Adolescence, which explored the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers, noting that he is not planning a sequel but is working on a new project using similar techniques. The show serves as a tribute to the journalists who exposed the unethical practices within their own field. </p>

          <p>Medical experts and regulators worldwide are criticizing Donald Trump's assertion that Tylenol use during pregnancy is linked to autism. Organizations like the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have defended acetaminophen as a safe pain reliever during pregnancy, citing a lack of evidence supporting a causal relationship with autism. Tylenol's manufacturer also reiterated its stance that credible science shows no proven link between the drug and autism. Experts point to a Swedish study of 2.4 million births that found no relationship between acetaminophen exposure and autism. Despite these reassurances, the FDA is approving leucovorin, a drug traditionally used to treat cancer patients, for use in children with autism. </p>

          <p>China has rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, which were designed as less advanced alternatives to comply with US restrictions, signaling a shift towards technological self-reliance. Despite hopes that China would accept these chips as a compromise, regulators have halted purchases and opened antitrust investigations into Nvidia. This decision highlights China's determination to reduce dependence on US technology and accelerate indigenous innovation. The US ban on high-end AI chips has strengthened the voices in China advocating for self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry. This move marks a turning point in the global technology landscape, with China prioritizing technological independence over reliance on US suppliers. </p>

          <p>President Trump advised pregnant women to avoid Tylenol, claiming a link between the drug and autism, and discouraged its use in young children. He also expressed skepticism about vaccines, suggesting a spaced-out immunization schedule and separate measles, mumps, and rubella shots. Trump's pronouncements contradict medical consensus and research, which generally attributes autism to a mix of genetic and environmental factors. The FDA issued a notice about a possible link between prenatal Tylenol use and ADHD in 2015, though with caveats about study flaws. Trump's approach, relying on personal feelings over scientific consensus, has sparked concern among researchers and medical professionals. </p>

The Trump administration had cited allegations of campus antisemitism and use of race in admissions as reasons for rescinding the grants.

The pigs help clear the forest floor of acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, contributing to the health of the ecosystem. Tourists are advised to drive carefully and maintain a safe distance from the pigs during pannage season, which typically lasts until late November.

          <p>"Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has returned to air after being suspended following comments Kimmel made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney, ABC's parent company, said the show was suspended to avoid inflaming tensions and that Kimmel's comments were insensitive. The decision to suspend Kimmel sparked controversy and criticism, with some calling it a violation of free speech. Several other late-night hosts and celebrities publicly sided with Kimmel. Disney said it had "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel before deciding to bring the show back. </p>

          <h2>Autism Groups Respond to Trump Administration's Tylenol Claims</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's claim that Tylenol use during pregnancy can contribute to autism has been met with criticism from autism experts and advocacy groups. Experts call the claim dangerous and regressive, citing that the causes of autism are not fully known, but genetics play a key role. Advocates expressed concern that the claim could lead to pregnant people avoiding necessary medical care. The oversimplification of autism is dehumanizing and could lead to negative health outcomes. The focus on a singular cause and a cure is a troubling trend that diverts resources from improving the lives of autistic people. </p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can dismiss a top official on the Federal Trade Commission, siding with Trump in a 6-3 decision. The court has also agreed to revisit a nearly century-old legal precedent that shields independent agencies from presidential interference. Justice Elena Kagan warned that the ruling allows the president to take charge of institutions Congress intended to protect from partisanship. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in December on overturning a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to set up independent agencies insulated from political interference. The court is also considering the Trump administration's request to remove a Federal Reserve governor. </p>

The FDA will initiate a safety-label update for Tylenol and send a letter to physicians about potential links between the drug's use and autism.

          <p>India is investing $18 billion to become a global chip major, aiming to reduce import dependence and capture a larger share of the global electronics market. The country has approved 10 semiconductor projects, including fabrication plants and testing facilities. Despite a large pool of engineering talent, experts say more is needed to realize India's chip ambitions. The government is providing incentives to attract manufacturers and supporting electronic component manufacturing. While India has made progress, it is still a long way from developing and manufacturing cutting-edge 2nm semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>
