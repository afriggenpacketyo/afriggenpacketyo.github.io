          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant network outage on Saturday, leaving many phones stuck in "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a software issue was impacting wireless service and stated their engineers were working quickly to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by DownDetector, surged in the afternoon, with complaints spanning from California to Florida. While in SOS mode, devices can still make emergency calls by connecting to other available carrier networks, but regular data and calling services were unavailable for affected users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a college football game between Syracuse and Tennessee, a Syracuse defender's sudden injury drew sharp criticism from game announcers, who suggested it was a deliberate tactic to stop the clock. The incident occurred in the second quarter as Tennessee was rapidly advancing down the field. Commentators Bob Wischusen and Louis Riddick called the moment "suspicious" and "blatant," noting that college football is trying to crack down on faking injuries to gain a strategic advantage. The player, Demetres Samuels Jr., returned to the field shortly after what one announcer jokingly called a "miraculous recovery."</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a career-long ambition for the filmmaker. The Netflix-funded project, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is a large-scale, 149-minute epic that delves into the perspectives of both characters. Early reviews are divided, with some critics praising it as one of del Toro's finest works for its artistry and emotional depth, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance. The film is noted for its extensive use of physical sets over CGI, reflecting the director's commitment to practical craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>This year's US Open at Flushing Meadows has been characterized by a notable increase in on-court anger and dramatic confrontations between players. Incidents include Daniil Medvedev's clash with an umpire, Jelena Ostapenko's heated post-match comments to Taylor Townsend, and Stefanos Tsitsipas's tense handshake with Daniel Altmaier. Players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff attribute the heightened emotions to the pressures of the final Grand Slam of a long season and the notoriously intense New York City crowds. While some incidents are seen as recurring behavior from specific players, the high-stakes environment appears to be amplifying the drama.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war approaches, some are looking to the shared history of World War II as a potential foundation for improving strained US-China relations. This perspective highlights the forgotten stories of cooperation between the two nations during the conflict. Among these accounts are the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their own lives to protect and shelter American airmen who were shot down by the Japanese army. The article suggests that remembering this period of mutual support and shared sacrifice could offer a path toward building better bilateral ties from a grassroots level.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her American opponent, Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" and "no class," apparently upset over a perceived lack of apology for a net cord winner. In a statement, Ostapenko explained that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, but acknowledged her words could have been offensive. The incident drew criticism and added to the tense atmosphere at this year's tournament.</p>

It also directs city departments to actively monitor federal immigration enforcement activities. The move is a preemptive measure against what the mayor's office calls credible reports of imminent militarized federal action, reflecting tensions between the city and the Trump administration.</p>

However, modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene evidence revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, including a likely self-inflicted gunshot wound and signs the scene was staged.

This decision places tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. goods imports on uncertain legal ground, pending a potential appeal to the Supreme Court by the administration.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign, accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine stance and advocacy for conspiracy theories. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy for launching a "war on science" and sowing mistrust in medicine, pointing to the recent firing of the CDC director and subsequent resignations of other top officials. Sanders warned that Kennedy's actions could lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases and make it harder for Americans to access necessary immunizations, undermining the nation's health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA), is set to eliminate 532 jobs at the direction of the Trump administration. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, is framed as an effort to reduce federal bureaucracy but has been met with legal challenges and criticism from employees. This action follows a recent court order that blocked Lake from firing VOA's director and required her to testify about the agency's operational changes. VOA was established during World War II to provide objective news in regions with limited press freedom.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK intend to continue legal action to block the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for this purpose constitutes an unauthorized change of use and a public safety risk. However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have stated they will press on with their own legal challenges. The issue remains a contentious political flashpoint, with protests and counter-demonstrations occurring at several hotel locations across the country.</p>

          <p>A passenger train traveling to Cairo derailed in northern Egypt, killing three people and injuring at least 103 others. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon when seven of the train's carriages came off the tracks near the coastal city of Marsa Matruh, with two carriages overturning completely. The Egyptian Health Minister visited the scene to oversee the emergency response and confirmed the casualties. The country's transport ministry and national railway authority have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash, a frequent occurrence on Egypt's poorly maintained and underfunded railway network.</p>

Vance, who spoke about being prepared to step in should a tragedy occur, raising concerns about the 79-year-old's health. The White House has recently addressed other health concerns, attributing bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of the expedited removal process for immigrants, dealing a significant blow to its deportation agenda. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that applying this streamlined process, which offers little due process, to immigrants detained in the country's interior is unlawful. Previously, expedited removal was primarily used for recent arrivals near the border, but the administration had widened its application nationwide. Judge Cobb's ruling, while not preventing courthouse arrests, curtails the government's ability to immediately remove individuals without affording them a meaningful opportunity to contest their case.</p>

          <p>Researchers say a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. A UK study involving over 12,000 patients found that the device, which analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope records an ECG and sends the data to the cloud for instant analysis against a vast patient database. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential "game-changer" for enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>
