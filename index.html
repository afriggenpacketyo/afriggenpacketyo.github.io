          <p>Christian Horner has officially departed from Red Bull Racing, agreeing to a severance package reportedly worth £52 million. His exit follows his dismissal as team principal in July, ending his tenure since the team's 2005 inception. Horner led the Formula 1 team to eight drivers' championships and six constructors' titles. The settlement reflects his significant role and long-term contract with the racing organization.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has unveiled plans to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for most migrants if they win the next election. This policy would require migrants to reapply for visas every five years under stricter criteria, including higher salary thresholds and English language proficiency. The party claims the changes would save £234 billion over decades and aims to curb the 'Boriswave' of post-Brexit immigration. Critics, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, question the feasibility and financial basis of the proposals, while business groups warn of potential economic disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, 'Inherited Inequality,' argues that promoting two-parent families does not eliminate racial inequality for Black youth. Her research shows Black children in two-parent homes still face significant disparities compared to white children in similar structures. The article highlights how federal spending on marriage promotion overlooks structural racism and resource gaps, such as income and wealth disparities. Cross advocates for broader interventions beyond family structure, emphasizing direct financial assistance and other social safety nets.</p>

ETFs generally offer significant tax efficiency due to their 'in-kind' transaction mechanism, which minimizes capital gains distributions. Additionally, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios, making them a cheaper option for many investors, though mutual funds may offer access to a broader universe of funds and are more common in 401(k) plans.

          <p>President Trump's administration is seeking to gain control of the Federal Reserve, sparking concerns that he could weaponize its vast powers. Beyond setting interest rates, the Fed controls money supply, access to the financial system, and can print and spend money at will through emergency lending provisions. Critics fear Trump could use this authority to reward allies, punish enemies, or fund priorities without Congressional approval.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has expressed willingness to resume stalled negotiations with the US, provided Washington abandons its 'hollow obsession' with denuclearization. Kim emphasized that North Korea developed nuclear weapons for survival and has enshrined its nuclear status in its constitution. While he maintains 'good memories' of President Trump, he has also slammed South Korea, rejecting unification with a country reliant on foreign powers. This article highlights Kim's stronger negotiating position, backed by Russia and China, as he seeks a new diplomatic path.</p>

          <p>The recent death of actor Robert Redford has renewed public interest in the unsolved murder of his daughter Shauna's boyfriend, Sid Wells, decades ago. Wells was fatally shot in 1983, and his roommate, Thayne Alan Smika, was arrested but charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence. Smika disappeared in 1986, but a 2010 warrant for his arrest was issued after new DNA tests. The FBI is now offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Smika's capture, highlighting Redford's enduring concern for the case.</p>

          <p>Kindergartners in California exhibit the highest rates of chronic absenteeism, defined as missing at least 10% of school days. This issue, exacerbated by the pandemic, has long-term impacts on literacy, academic success, and social-emotional development, particularly for Latino children in districts like LA Unified. Parent focus groups revealed illness and difficulty transitioning to school as primary reasons, rather than a lack of value for early education. The article highlights the need for clearer communication, grace periods, and non-punitive interventions to address this persistent educational challenge.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aggressively recruiting experienced law enforcement officers with hefty bonuses and six-figure salaries, but is struggling to poach California police. Despite broadening its applicant pool by dropping age and language requirements, ICE faces stiff competition from high-paying local agencies in California. The recruitment drive, part of the Trump administration's push to expand ICE, has also sparked resentment among local police chiefs.
