          <p>The UK is bracing for potentially record-breaking temperatures, with forecasts predicting highs of 29C (82F) this week, marking the warmest start to May on record. This follows the warmest day of the year so far, recorded on Monday, with temperatures expected to peak on Thursday during local elections in England. While the warm spell is not expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, temperatures are expected to gradually cool over the bank holiday weekend, remaining dry and sunny in most areas. Experts note that such spring heat is becoming more frequent due to climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged Americans to trust President Trump's economic policies, citing his "historic success" during his first term. This comes as polls reveal that a majority of Americans are concerned about a potential recession, with many feeling that the economy has worsened since Trump took office and their personal finances have declined. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that a tax reduction would alleviate these fears and provide businesses with certainty, despite ongoing economic uncertainty. The administration is attempting to reassure the public and business leaders that its policies will lead to economic stability and growth.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is facing potential significant cuts, leading to uncertainty about its future role in consumer protection. The Trump administration's efforts to scale back the agency have raised concerns among consumer advocates and fintech companies alike. Proposed changes include overturning rules on bank overdraft fees and payment app regulations, potentially leaving consumers with fewer protections. There are also concerns about the effectiveness of the CFPB's consumer complaint database if enforcement is weakened, as it may reduce the likelihood of companies addressing consumer issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles is forecasting a significant drop in shipping volume, with executive director Gene Seroka projecting a 35% decrease next week compared to the previous year due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Many major American retailers are reportedly halting shipments from China in response to the increased levies. Seroka anticipates that this reduction in volume will lead to less choice and higher prices for consumers, as retailers may experience shortages of specific goods. He estimates that U.S. retailers have about five to seven weeks before the impact of the reduced shipments begins to affect product availability.</p>

          <p>An invasive Chinese mitten crab, known for its ability to climb over high structures, has been discovered in the Pacific Northwest for the first time. Wildlife officials warn that this species caused significant infrastructure and ecological damage in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1990s. The crab, identified as a large male, may have been introduced illegally or through ballast water from a ship. Officials are collaborating to assess the extent of the infestation and are urging the public to report any sightings of the invasive species.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard seized approximately 10,000 pounds of cocaine from a fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, with an estimated value of $74 million.

Five suspected smugglers were apprehended and are in U.S. custody.

          <p>Despite trade tensions between Canada and the United States under President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's recent election win is unlikely to lead to a significant improvement in relations between Canada and China, according to analysts. Carney's Liberal Party secured a victory amid international attention on Trump's tariff policies. However, analysts suggest that Canada's existing doubts about China, which Carney identified as the nation's biggest security threat, will prevent a quick thaw in relations between Ottawa and Beijing.</p>

          <p>An article in CBS News examines Elon Musk's significant role in the Trump administration, particularly his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's efforts to cut government spending and restructure federal agencies have faced legal challenges, pushback from federal workers, and criticism from Tesla investors. While Musk has promised substantial cost savings, many of DOGE's claims have been questioned, and some of its actions have been blocked by courts. Despite these challenges, Musk remains a key figure in the administration's efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government.</p>

Despite Trump's initial distancing from the initiative, many of his actions in the first 100 days of his second term closely align with Project 2025's recommendations. These include abolishing the Department of Education, ending diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, shifting FEMA costs to the states, and targeting PBS and National Public Radio.

          <p>An article from BBC News details how Spain recovered from an unprecedented national blackout, examining the causes and measures taken to restore power. The blackout was caused by connection problems and a disconnection from the French network, leading to a significant loss of power generation. Restoring power involved a phased approach, focusing on hydroelectric and combined-cycle gas plants, with assistance from France and Morocco. The incident has raised questions about the reliability of Spain's energy grid and the role of renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian examines Elon Musk's rise to success and his subsequent actions that undermine the very systems that enabled his achievements. Musk's companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity, have benefited from significant public investment, including government loans, tax credits, and federal contracts. Despite this, Musk has used his position in the Trump administration to dismantle government programs and regulations that once supported his own companies. The author argues that Musk's actions represent a betrayal of public investment and a systemic effort to benefit himself at the expense of collective progress.</p>
