        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. will not alter current tariff levels on Chinese imports, even without a finalized trade deal. This announcement followed high-level trade talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators in London. President Trump indicated that U.S. duties on China would total 55%, a figure clarified by a White House official as comprising existing tariffs. Trump also mentioned that China's tariffs on the U.S. would remain at 10%, as agreed upon last month after initial talks in Geneva. The context is that these tariffs have been a point of contention between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following two days of violent unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, police are increasing resources in affected areas. The violence, which injured 32 officers and led to six arrests, began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson condemned the violence as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers" and stated that all footage of the incidents would be reviewed for prosecution. The police have requested additional officers from Great Britain to help maintain public order and bring offenders to justice, with some homes displaying stickers outlining the residents' nationalities. The community is left in fear for their lives and livelihoods as the violence undermines the criminal investigation and causes further distress to the victim and their family. The optimism score is based on the context of the damage and injuries. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attorney is requesting that the appeal of his New York hush money conviction be moved to federal court. Arguments were presented before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, with Trump's attorney asserting that the case involves "official acts" undertaken during his presidency, potentially warranting federal immunity. The Manhattan district attorney's office argued that it is too late to move the case and that the purpose of removal is not for appellate review. The judges did not immediately rule and will take the arguments under advisement. The context is that this case involves alleged hush money payments made to an adult film actress during the 2016 presidential election. </p>

          <h2>FEMA Phasing Out After Hurricane Season</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) after this hurricane season. States should lead their own disaster response, according to Trump, though states already lead disaster response. Under the Trump administration, the agency has lost roughly a quarter of its core staff. The weather doesn’t stop after that, of course. Fire season overlaps with hurricane season, another time of intense FEMA activity, and in recent years, fires have broken the bounds of any usual seasons; the devastating Los Angeles fires were in January. </p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are pushing for political inclusion. Malawi is an East African country of 21 million people, will hold elections on September 16. With more than half of Malawi's population under the age of 35, the question of youth inclusion in politics has been drawing growing attention. However, entrenched party structures and financial barriers stand in their way. </p>

          <h2>Longest Par Three in Major Championship History at US Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 11:13:32 EDT</div>

          <p>This week's 125th US Open will feature the longest par-three hole in major championship history at 301 yards. The eighth at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania has been called "ridiculous" by Collin Morikawa and "silly" by Viktor Hovland. At the 1953 US Open the eighth played 253 yards, longer than the average drive by a PGA Tour player that year. The psychology of par is amazing. </p>
