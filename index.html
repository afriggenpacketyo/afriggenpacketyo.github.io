            <p>First responders and survivors of the 9/11 terror attacks are experiencing turmoil due to recent cuts and restructuring within the federal health department, impacting the World Trade Center Health Program.

            <p>Devastating attacks on camps in Sudan's Darfur region, housing hundreds of thousands displaced by the civil war, have persisted for three days, resulting in the deaths of over 100 civilians, including children and aid workers. The UN and US State Department have expressed grave concern over the attacks on Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, blaming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who deny responsibility. Residents describe dire conditions with limited access to medicine and closed routes, exacerbating the already famine-like situation in the camps, as the conflict between the RSF and the army enters its second year.</p>

            <p>While condemnation of Donald Trump's trade policies has been widespread, it's crucial to recognize that the forces underpinning his political project have been long in the making. Globalization, though beneficial to consumers through access to cheaper goods, has created winners and losers within rich countries, particularly impacting working-class men whose employment rates have fallen and wages have stagnated. To move forward, international collaboration is needed to address the shortcomings of globalization, ensuring that efforts to fix the system don't simply rebuild the pre-Trump world exactly as it was.</p>

            <p>The British government has taken control of the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe through emergency legislation to prevent its owners from shutting down two blast furnaces. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds declined to guarantee the furnaces would remain open due to commercial sensitivities around raw material supplies. The government intervened after owners Jingye rejected financial support, putting the UK's ability to produce virgin steel at risk, which is vital for major construction projects. The government is now seeking a buyer for British Steel, but Reynolds stated he would not sell to another Chinese company, and the cost to taxpayers remains uncertain.</p>

            <p>The article explores the convergence of corporate city-state ambitions and mass-market bunker nations within the framework of what it terms "end times fascism." It argues that both visions, fueled by anxieties about shocks, scarcity, and collapse, share similarities with Christian fundamentalist interpretations of the biblical Rapture. The piece critiques the secular Rapture sought by Silicon Valley elites, exemplified by figures like Elon Musk, and examines how this ideology intersects with right-wing movements focused on hardening national borders and expelling unwanted populations, suggesting a dangerous trend toward a supremacist survivalism.</p>

            <p>Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden is reflecting on her experiences since being diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Dowden, who revealed her diagnosis in May 2023, needed a mastectomy and underwent chemotherapy. In February 2024, Dowden announced she had "no evidence of disease" following tests. She has urged others to trust their instincts and has reflected on how much has changed since her diagnosis and how proud she is of how far she's come. The BBC has confirmed she will be returning for Strictly's 2025 series.</p>

            <p>In a quiet announcement, the US exempted smartphones from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China, a major retreat on Trump's trade war. The inclusion of code "8517.13.00.00" meant the number one Chinese export to America was exempted, alongside other electronic devices and components. Without the exemption, 125% tariffs on Apple's Zhengzou manufacturing facility would have shown in weeks across American Apple stores, which would have been a totemic "sticker shock" for the White House tumultuous tariff push.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which previously benefited from the first US-China trade war, now faces economic uncertainty due to President Trump's latest tariffs, including a 46% tax on imports from Vietnam. While the administration has announced a temporary stay on the new duties, the high tariff rate threatens to make Vietnamese products noncompetitive in the US market. With manufacturing accounting for a significant portion of Vietnam's GDP, the country is seeking ways to mitigate the impact, such as lowering corporate tax rates and offering incentives for local factories.</p>

            <p>A contributor draws parallels between Donald Trump and characters from Homer's "Iliad," ultimately concluding that Trump is most akin to King Agamemnon. The author argues that like Agamemnon, Trump is a brute who never learns, relying on intimidation rather than persuasion and blaming others when his plans fail. The essay suggests that Trump, like Agamemnon, leads his followers on a self-defeating crusade that causes unnecessary pain and suffering, ultimately doing no good even to those on whose behalf it was ostensibly fought.</p>

            <p>Cheap clothes from China are nearly certain to face a steep price hike as Trump tariffs take effect, prompting concern among fast fashion retailers and potentially pushing consumers to look for other alternatives. The de-minimis rule, which allowed packages under $800 to enter the US duty-free, is ending, leading to tariffs on goods from China and Hong Kong. This change could create an opening for consumers to consider secondhand clothes or push companies to diversify production outside of China.</p>

Despite a temporary pause on some tariffs, the potential for long-lasting and damaging conflicts looms, causing anxiety among farmers in the Central Valley. The situation adds to existing challenges such as labor shortages, inflation, and climate change, threatening the viability of small family farms.</p>

Despite promises of change, Johnson has resisted efforts to codify ethics rules, address concerns about gift handling, and support the Inspector General's investigations. The mayor's focus on equitable distribution of government services is seen as a diversion from addressing historical corruption, leading to concerns about the future of ethics reform in Chicago.</p>
