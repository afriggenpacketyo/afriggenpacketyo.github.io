Google plans to change its architecture to prevent single-system failures from causing widespread crashes and will improve its communication to customers during incidents.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities in England and Wales have often avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gang cases. The report indicates that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of grooming gang members, hindering accurate national assessments. While acknowledging the lack of comprehensive data, the report highlights disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects in certain police force areas. The Home Secretary apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry, emphasizing the need to examine and expose these issues to prevent marginalizing communities.

The government argued it does not trust Harvard to monitor foreign students, citing concerns about foreign entanglements.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his intention to expand deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those with Democratic leadership. Speaking at the G7 summit, Trump stated that ICE should focus on sanctuary cities, accusing Democrats of using illegal immigration for political gain. This announcement follows nationwide protests against his administration's immigration policies. While Trump has acknowledged the contributions of some undocumented workers, his administration remains committed to a policy of mass deportations.</p>
