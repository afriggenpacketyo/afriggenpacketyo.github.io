          <p>New Jersey has declared a state of emergency due to Hurricane Erin, which is threatening coastal flooding, rip currents, and gale-force winds across the Atlantic coasts of the US and Canada. Although the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025 is weakening and moving away from North America, the National Hurricane Center warns of continuing life-threatening conditions. The storm has already caused beach and road closures along the US east coast, with North Carolina still recovering from a previous hurricane. Puerto Rico also experienced widespread power outages due to high winds damaging electricity lines.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading global authority, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City, with projections for it to spread to other southern cities. This marks the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, affecting over half a million people facing catastrophic conditions of starvation and death. Israel immediately rejected the IPC's assessment, claiming there is no famine and accusing the report of bias. UN officials and aid groups, however, attribute the crisis to Israel's systematic obstruction of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke's libel case against The Guardian newspaper has been dismissed by a judge, who found the allegations of sexual misconduct published in 2021 to be "substantially true." Clarke had sued the publisher over multiple articles claiming he used his industry power to harass women. The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a victory for the women who suffered and for investigative journalism. Clarke expressed disappointment, stating he is not the person described in the articles.</p>

This follows previous orders by Trump to mobilize the National Guard and police to address D.C.'s crime problem.

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has characterized the ongoing transfer situation with striker Alexander Isak as a "lose-lose situation," stating he hasn't spoken to the player in a week. Isak desires to join Liverpool, but Newcastle rejected a £110m bid and denied the player's claim of broken promises regarding his departure. The 25-year-old Swedish international is now training separately from the first team and will miss upcoming matches. Howe remains uncertain about the forward's future before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>Canada is being forced to seriously consider its self-defense capabilities as the second Trump administration raises concerns about potential American aggression. Historically reliant on the US, Canada is now exploring a "whole society defense" model, drawing inspiration from Finland's approach to deterring larger powers. Experts warn Canada is currently unprepared, describing its military as "a snack" in a potential conflict. The article suggests this shift would require a fundamental reorchestration of Canada's national identity, moving beyond its traditional peace-loving nature.</p>

          <p>The measles outbreak in Texas has concluded, but rising cases nationwide underscore the need for preparedness in undervaccinated communities, particularly amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment.

Lessons from Texas suggest the need for tailored, accessible vaccination campaigns and community-led education efforts, along with resources for rapid public health responses.

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally terminated union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, following an appeals court ruling that lifted an injunction. Unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, warn this move is a test case for broader attacks on labor rights across the US. The administration cites national security for the executive order, though the Department of Veterans Affairs claimed it would free up resources. Critics argue this action undermines worker advocacy and could degrade public services.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a symbol of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be released from jail in Tennessee.

His attorneys accuse the administration of "vindictive and selective prosecution," denying allegations of gang membership and smuggling.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Los Angeles labor groups are pushing for a "New Deal" to secure commitments for working people. They demand multi-billion dollar investments in 50,000 housing units, a ban on short-term rentals like Airbnb, greater transparency in venue agreements, and protections for immigrant workers. Unions argue that past mega-events have often displaced low-income residents and left host cities indebted. Olympic organizers, however, contend the Games will bring positive economic impact and job opportunities to the region.</p>

          <p>This article reviews David Baron's book, "The Martians," which delves into the early 20th-century fascination with intelligent life on Mars. The book explores how respected scientists and media, alongside fringe theorists, projected human fantasies onto the red planet, fueled by figures like Percival Lowell and Nikola Tesla. Baron's work, praised for its clarity and narrative drive, examines the social currents that led to "Mars fever," including the theory of evolution and the rise of tabloid journalism. The review concludes that while the "canals" were ultimately disproven, this era of imagination inspired generations toward space exploration.</p>

          <p>Berlin's long-standing effort to rename "Mohrenstraße," a street with racist connotations, to "Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße," honoring a Black German Enlightenment philosopher, has been halted again by a court. The district council had approved the change, but a lawsuit from residents' initiative "Pro Mohrenstraße" is preventing its implementation. Civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name, which derives from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany. The article highlights the historical context of the name and the ongoing debate over decolonization in Germany.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed group, has confirmed a famine in Gaza Governorate, with projections to expand, warning over half a million people are at risk of starvation. The report calls it an "entirely man-made" disaster, urging immediate action to halt and reverse the crisis. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the findings, attributing them to "Hamas's fake campaign," while aid groups accuse Israel of "weaponizing" aid through deliberate restrictions. The situation is exacerbated by forced displacements and the collapse of social fabric amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>China's electricity consumption in July surpassed 1 trillion kilowatt-hours, setting a new record equivalent to the annual usage of all ASEAN nations combined. This surge was primarily driven by scorching heatwaves and a 20.2% year-on-year growth in electricity use within the primary industry, including agriculture and fisheries. The data, released by China’s National Energy Administration, reflects the country's immense energy demands and the impact of environmental factors on consumption patterns, even as industrial output growth slowed slightly.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation charge, a decision he confirmed himself after leaving court. The Bangkok Criminal Court found insufficient evidence and noted potential political bias in witnesses. This acquittal is a significant development for Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in 2023 after years in exile, despite facing other corruption-related charges. The case highlights Thailand's strict lese majeste law and the ongoing political influence of the courts and traditional establishment against figures perceived as challengers.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a key speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as the central bank considers its first interest rate cut of 2025. This comes amidst President Trump's persistent calls for lower rates to boost the economy, and his public pressure on Fed officials. Policymakers face a dilemma: raising rates to counter tariff-induced inflation risks a downturn, while lowering them to stimulate the economy could worsen inflation. Powell is expected to clarify the Fed's stance on inflation versus employment following recent weak jobs reports.</p>

          <p>Germany's gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, steeper than initial estimates, indicating Europe's largest economy is losing momentum.

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed eliminating federal funding for TRIO programs, such as Upward Bound, which assist low-income and first-generation students in pursuing higher education. The White House argues that college access is no longer a significant obstacle and places the onus on colleges for student support. Advocates, however, highlight TRIO's 60-year track record of success, with participants being significantly more likely to earn degrees. The proposal has sparked worry among students and educators, particularly in regions like eastern Kentucky, where such programs are vital.</p>

While nationwide prices are minimally up, many large metro areas are experiencing softening prices, and mortgage rates have inched down. Experts predict rates will remain near current levels through the year, with potential for further slight drops in 2026, easing the "lock-in effect" for some homeowners.</p>
