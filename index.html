          <p>Elon Musk's satellite internet service, Starlink, suffered a brief but widespread network outage, the second such incident in two weeks. The disruption occurred as SpaceX continues to aggressively expand its satellite constellation, recently launching another batch from Vandenberg Space Force Base. This expansion effort faces regulatory challenges, with the California Coastal Commission opposing an increase in launch frequency due to environmental and community impact concerns.</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could run out of water within weeks. The impending disaster is attributed to a combination of a long-lasting drought, extreme summer heat, and significant government mismanagement of the nation's dams. This convergence of environmental and administrative failures has left water levels dangerously low, posing a grave threat to the Iranian population and its stability.</p>

          <p>The progressive cable news network MSNBC is rebranding to "MS NOW" as it is spun off from its parent company, Comcast, into a new, separate entity. This move is part of a broader trend of large media corporations divesting from declining cable news businesses. The article suggests the change may also be politically motivated, creating distance between Comcast and the network's critical coverage of the Trump administration, thereby reducing potential regulatory pressure.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges related to the drug overdose death of actor Matthew Perry. Her plea agreement makes her the fifth and final defendant to do so in the case, avoiding a trial. Prosecutors alleged Sangha was a prolific dealer who supplied Perry with the fatal dose of ketamine just days before he was found dead in his home in October 2023, bringing a legal conclusion to the investigation.</p>

While there are no federal age limits, most insurance companies impose their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old. The best time to buy depends on individual financial strategy, as purchasing at an older age can result in higher monthly payments but also carries the risk of reduced product availability or disqualification due to health.

          <p>The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued an urgent warning about counterfeit versions of the popular Labubu dolls, which it says pose a serious choking and death risk to young children. These knockoffs, sometimes called "Lafufus," are often small enough to fit in a child's mouth and can break into smaller, hazardous pieces. The agency is urging consumers to stop using any fake dolls immediately and has provided tips for identifying authentic products from the seller Pop Mart.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has voiced his opinion that the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an investment bubble, where investor excitement may have become excessive. He drew a parallel to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, where a kernel of truth about the internet's potential led to widespread overvaluation. While Altman affirmed his belief in the long-term transformative power of AI, his comments serve as a caution about the market's current trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the average credit card interest rate currently near 22%, carrying a $25,000 balance can be extremely costly. A financial analysis shows that a consumer making only minimum payments on this amount would accrue approximately $5,500 in interest charges alone in a single year. The article highlights how compounding interest can make it difficult to pay down the principal balance and offers several strategies for reducing debt, such as balance transfers and negotiating for a lower APR.</p>
