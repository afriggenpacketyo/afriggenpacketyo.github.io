          <p>The United Nations' aviation council has ruled that Russia is responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the deaths of all 298 people on board, including numerous Dutch and Australian citizens. The Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stated that Russia failed to uphold its obligations under international air law, following a case launched by Australia and the Netherlands in 2022. The ruling is considered a significant step towards achieving justice and accountability for the victims and sends a message that states cannot violate international law with impunity. The Netherlands and Australia are seeking reparations from Russia.</p>

          <p>Jacqueline Ma, a former California 'teacher of the year,' has been sentenced to 30 years to life for grooming and sexually assaulting two young boys in her elementary school classroom. Ma exploited her position as a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher to manipulate her victims with gifts and special attention, even setting up an unsanctioned after-school program for one of the boys. She performed sexual acts on the boy in her classroom over a three-month period, while his parents thought he was participating in an after-school basketball program. The case came to light after one of the victim's mothers discovered inappropriate messages between her son and Ma on a family tablet.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is defending a plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating it would be a "very nice gesture" considering U.S. assistance to the country. The potential value of the plane and its handling have raised legal and ethical questions due to the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics, including some of Trump's supporters, have raised concerns about the ethics of accepting such a gift, while the White House insists any gift will be accepted in compliance with applicable laws. The Qatari government says the transfer is for "temporary use" and is under discussion.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, citing that there are no more excuses for inaction and releasing a model ordinance for local municipalities. Newsom emphasized the need to take back the streets and provide alternatives to encampments, backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. The model ordinance states that policies towards encampments must reflect certain basic principles, including that no person should face criminal prosecution for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. This effort comes as Newsom approaches the end of his final term and speculation builds about his political future.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, have dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student, which led to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The police admitted to stopping the wrong vehicle, but Arias Cristobal remains in ICE custody facing deportation because she is in the U.S. without authorization. Her father is also being held by ICE following a separate traffic stop. The case highlights the Trump administration's expanded deportation policies, which prioritize the arrest of individuals lacking valid immigration documents, even without criminal records.</p>

          <p>An auction of the art collection of the Riggio family, who built their fortune on the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain, revealed a cautious mood in the art market. The auction, held at Christie's in New York, saw quiet bidding and presold items, indicating a lack of enthusiastic buyers compared to the market's peak in 2022. Experts attributed the sale's anticlimactic nature to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariffs and their potential impact on the global art market. Despite a $272 million total, the sale fell short of pre-sale expectations, signaling a need for auction houses to work harder in a healthy, but less exuberant market.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), seeking to limit funding and benefits as part of a package to advance President Trump’s tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding to food stamps and mandate more beneficiaries to obtain employment in exchange for federal aid. These moves could result in millions of low-income families losing access to the program. Republicans argue that their approach would improve the provision of benefits while helping to defray the cost of Mr. Trump’s expensive legislative ambitions.</p>

          <p>Chad Hill, a former longtime school administrator, has been sentenced to one and a half years in prison and five years of probation for a sexual assault case involving a child. Hill pleaded guilty to a charge of gross sexual imposition, and a sexual assault charge was dropped. He is also required to register as a Tier I sexual offender, meaning he must register his address every year for 15 years. The victim in the case was a juvenile, but not a student at Greene County Educational Service Center (ESC), where Hill was employed at the time of the offense.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate since 2014, driven by the oil and gas sector and strong growth in tech and finance. The World Bank expects the rate of growth to slightly increase in 2025 to 3.7%. This growth comes amid reforms by President Bola Tinubu's government, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency. However, poverty remains high, and inflation is expected to stay above 20% throughout the year, impacting ordinary Nigerians.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching an all-time high, driven by unpredictable US trade policies, geopolitical uncertainty, and rising inflationary pressures. Central banks have also increased their gold reserves, contributing to the demand. While gold is seen as a stable asset and a hedge against inflation, experts caution that its price is not immune to fluctuations and that a market bubble may be forming. Some analysts predict a potential price drop in the coming years, while others believe the upward trend will continue, fueled by ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

          <p>The focus of weight-loss drugs is shifting from mere weight reduction to improving overall health, particularly by reducing visceral fat, which is linked to numerous chronic diseases. GLP-1 drugs, while effective for weight loss, are expensive and have side effects, making them suitable for a subset of Americans with excess visceral fat and related health issues. Physicians need to identify individuals who can benefit most from these drugs, using measures like waist size and blood-lipid patterns, rather than relying solely on BMI. Understanding the true killer—not weight, but toxic fat—is crucial for saving lives and improving health.</p>
