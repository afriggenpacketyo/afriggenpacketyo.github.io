          <p>A recent Russian drone strike in Kharkiv, Ukraine, resulted in the tragic deaths of at least seven people, including two children, impacting an apartment building. This severe attack occurred just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared for crucial peace talks with President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington. Ukrainian officials condemned the strike as a cynical attempt by Russia to exert pressure and undermine diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. The incident underscores the persistent brutality of the war, with July seeing the highest monthly drone and missile launches to date, resulting in 286 civilian deaths. These ongoing long-range strike campaigns continue despite international efforts to broker a ceasefire and peace deal.</p>

          <p>Former Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown has officially announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026, seeking to reclaim his seat after his previous defeat. Brown, a Democrat, frames his campaign around his commitment to workers and treating all Ohioans with dignity, echoing his long-held populist themes. He is set to challenge Republican Senator Jon Husted, who holds the seat vacated by JD Vance and has the backing of former President Trump. This election is poised to be a pivotal contest in the 2026 midterms, with national Democrats actively recruiting Brown in their efforts to regain a majority in the Senate. The race highlights Ohio's evolving political landscape, where Brown previously outperformed his party's top-of-ticket candidates.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled to face questions from Congress regarding his personal involvement in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein's death in 2019. Barr had personally reviewed surveillance footage and concluded Epstein died by suicide, but recent analyses by CBS News identified inconsistencies between his description and the publicly released video. Congressional oversight committee members will probe Barr's actions and the Justice Department's handling of the case, as new questions arise about missing video segments and the thoroughness of the investigation. The renewed scrutiny follows the public release of the surveillance video and ongoing conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's death in federal custody.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, has publicly criticized India for its continued purchases of Russian crude oil, accusing the nation of undermining international efforts to isolate Russia's economy. Navarro stated that India's actions effectively act as a "global clearinghouse" for Russian oil, providing Moscow with needed dollars. This criticism comes amidst reports of canceled U.S.-India trade negotiations and the Trump administration's imposition of additional tariffs on India, bringing total levies to 50%. India defends its imports as a necessity for affordable energy, while also pointing out that other nations criticizing them also trade with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's obesity drug, Wegovy, has received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious liver disease. This approval marks Wegovy as the first GLP-1 class treatment authorized for MASH, expanding its applications beyond diabetes and obesity. The company's shares surged following the announcement, further boosted by a decision to reduce the cost of Ozempic for cash-paying patients. This development positions Wegovy uniquely in the metabolic disease market, building on its proven benefits for weight loss and cardiovascular health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires across Spain and Portugal have claimed at least two more lives, bringing the total death toll to four, as Spanish authorities deploy an additional 500 troops to combat the blazes.

Thousands of residents remain evacuated in Spain, where the air quality is severely impacted by smoke. These fires, also affecting Greece, France, and Turkey, are exacerbated by heatwave conditions, with meteorologists linking their increasing severity and frequency to human-induced climate change.</p>

Israel has consistently rejected these claims. The proposal aims to launch negotiations for a permanent ceasefire and facilitate the unrestricted flow of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory, which has seen over 62,000 Palestinian deaths since the conflict began in October 2023.</p>

Observations from the opening weekend highlight Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks despite attacking reinforcements, a shift from last season's strong defensive record. Manchester City's improved performance without Rodri, following his injury, demonstrates Pep Guardiola's successful tactical adjustments. Meanwhile, Arsenal's new direct and counter-attacking approach, a departure from their methodical possession-based style, proved ineffective against Manchester United, raising questions about how they will balance their evolving strategy.

          <p>The labor market is seeing a new trend called "job hugging," where workers are holding onto their current positions tightly, a stark contrast to the previous "great resignation" era. This phenomenon is attributed to a stagnant labor market with low rates of hires, quits, and layoffs, along with economic and global uncertainty. While staying in a job isn't inherently negative, experts warn that "job hugging" can lead to sacrificed earnings growth and career stagnation, as job switchers typically see higher wage increases. The trend also makes it harder for new entrants, like recent graduates, to find employment opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

This move comes amid increasing political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the U.S., including calls from President Donald Trump for direct-to-consumer sales models. The initiative aims to expand access for eligible Type 2 diabetes patients without insurance coverage and to encourage the use of branded medication over cheaper compounded alternatives. This strategy also intensifies competition in the GLP-1 market, where Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are vying for dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Modern disability memoirs are evolving beyond traditional narratives of overcoming adversity, offering more complex and ambivalent portrayals of lived experience. Authors like Andrew Leland, Chloé Cooper Jones, and Raymond Antrobus explore the contradictions, gifts, and burdens of disability, engaging in rigorous self-analysis and questioning societal assumptions. This new wave of writing aims to present disabled experience as worthy of deep study, moving away from being solely tools for education or empathy. These memoirs challenge readers to understand disability as an experience rather than a trauma, highlighting the dignity of individuals and the inadequacy of binary classifications.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling flights and initiated a gradual suspension of operations, anticipating a possible strike by its flight attendants starting Saturday. This action, prompted by a 72-hour strike notice from the union representing 10,000 flight attendants, could impact hundreds of thousands of travelers, including 25,000 Canadians stranded abroad daily. The airline has offered full refunds and alternative travel options, but expects a full restart of operations to take a week.

Beijing has adopted a more assertive negotiating stance, having reduced its dependence on the U.S. export market and developed its own tools, like export control laws, to exert leverage. China is expected to demand a more balanced agreement this time, seeking concessions from Washington on issues such as export controls and tariffs. The complexities stem from China's increased self-reliance and its willingness to use its economic power, making simple solutions elusive for U.S. efforts to stabilize the bilateral relationship.

A "major hurricane" is defined as Category 3 or higher, signifying potential for significant loss of life and extensive damage. The Atlantic hurricane season, running from June 1 to November 30, is predicted to be "above average" for 2024. The scale provides crucial information for understanding the destructive power of storms, with examples like Hurricane Andrew (Category 5) and Hurricane Katrina (Category 3 at landfall) illustrating the catastrophic impacts associated with different categories.</p>

These reforms are expected to benefit manufacturing, logistics, housing, and consumer goods sectors, with auto industry stocks already seeing increases. The move is designed to shore up India's economy, which is heavily reliant on domestic consumption, amidst geopolitical uncertainty and rising U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration over India's Russian crude purchases.
