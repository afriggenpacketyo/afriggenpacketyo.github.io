          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif is now subject to mandatory genetic sex testing by World Boxing due to concerns about her eligibility to compete in the women's category. The organization announced that all boxers must undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to determine their sex at birth, following controversy surrounding Khelif's participation in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup in June. Khelif previously faced scrutiny and disqualification from the IBA's world championships, leading to the new mandate aimed at ensuring fairness and safety in competition. World Boxing emphasizes its respect for individual dignity and its commitment to competitive fairness for all athletes. The PCR test, which can be conducted through a nasal swab, saliva, or blood sample, reveals the presence of the Y chromosome to determine biological sex.</p>

However, Hamas is reportedly seeking additional demands, including a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. Negotiations are ongoing as mediators work to bridge the gaps between the two sides, with the goal of halting the ongoing conflict that has resulted in significant casualties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faith Salie examines the pervasive use of corporate buzzwords and their impact on workplace communication, noting that while intended to foster inclusion, jargon often undermines trust. Studies reveal that employees who feel lower in status tend to use more jargon, possibly as a coping mechanism. The article suggests that these buzzwords are often metaphors used to distract from the primary goal of making money. Salie advocates for clear, human language over corporate jargon, recommending poetry as a more authentic outlet for metaphorical expression.</p>

          <p>Parisian authorities have launched an investigation into acts of vandalism targeting several Jewish sites across the city, including the Shoah Memorial and three synagogues. The sites were defaced with green paint, and an open can of paint was found nearby. Surveillance footage from the Holocaust Memorial reportedly showed an individual dressed in black spraying paint overnight. The Paris prosecutor's office has opened a probe for "damage committed on the grounds of religion," and the Interior Minister expressed "immense disgust" regarding the attacks, which occurred ahead of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.</p>

          <p>Laura Kuenssberg previews the UK's upcoming strategic defence review, which seeks to address the challenges posed by a "new, dangerous era" marked by a resurgent Russia and an increasingly assertive China. The review will emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, NATO commitments, and modernizing the armed forces with technologies like drones. It also stresses the need for greater public involvement in national resilience, potentially including expanding cadet forces and bolstering military reserves. The review aims to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and potentially 3% by 2034, though some critics question whether this is sufficient to meet current defence plans and growing ambitions.</p>

          <p>A group of 138 former state and federal judges has condemned the indictment of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, calling it an "egregious overreach" by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest at her courthouse, facing charges that could result in a six-year prison sentence and a $350,000 fine. The former judges filed an amicus brief, urging the government to dismiss the charges, arguing that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her judicial acts, similar to protections afforded to members of the legislative and executive branches.

          <p>Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is "the least" of what a woman's reproductive system does, sparking debate among pro-life activists and commentators. During a podcast episode with her brother and an OB/GYN, Obama lamented that women's reproductive health "has been reduced to the question of choice." Critics argue that motherhood is a beautiful and powerful gift, while supporters suggest Obama was highlighting the broader health implications of women's reproductive systems. The former First Lady's remarks have ignited a conversation about the complexities and societal perceptions of women's reproductive health.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist specializing in youth development, suggests five straightforward rules for parents: trust your instincts, embrace your culture, follow your child's interests, prioritize enjoyment over strict development, and be authentic. She emphasizes that parenting doesn't need to be overly complicated or driven by external pressures from influencers or clickbait. Instead, she advises parents to focus on creating a joyful and supportive environment where children can thrive by exploring their passions and developing emotional intelligence. Ross encourages parents to trust their inherent abilities and cultural traditions while adapting to their child's unique needs.</p>

The couple, who secured a 30-year mortgage, plan to pay it off in under five years by doing most of the renovation work themselves, including clearing land, gardening, and caring for over 30 animals. Sophie, inspired by the homestead, also founded a skincare company, while Rocky discovered a new identity outside of his previous career. Their biggest takeaway is recognizing the significant impact individuals can have on the planet by stewarding a piece of land.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, along with other radical right-wing groups in Europe and the US, presents itself as a defender of the Christian West against Islam, though religion is not truly central to this conflict. The AfD exploits Christian traditions to appeal to a broader audience, capitalizing on fears about Islam and societal change. While devout Christians are rare within the AfD, the party leverages Christian values to attack immigration and promote a sense of cultural identity. Discussions about gender identity and other social issues are also exploited to capitalize on social uncertainty, though critics view the AfD's relationship with Christianity as primarily instrumental.</p>

This action comes shortly after the discovery of five deceased musicians from Grupo Fugitivo in Reynosa, which stirred additional concern. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico cited confidentiality laws, preventing further information on the visa case. The Trump administration has increasingly targeted Mexican artists who, in some instances, romanticize cartel leaders, while the genre often reflects the harsh realities faced by Mexican youth amid cartel violence.</p>

While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, the IAEA cannot confirm this, leading to accusations from Israel that Iran is determined to acquire nuclear weapons.
