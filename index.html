          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is contemplating the withdrawal of its emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children under five years old. This potential move, which Pfizer confirmed it is discussing with the agency, could significantly limit vaccine options for this age group. The deliberations are not related to the vaccine's safety or efficacy profile, according to Pfizer. This action is noted as part of a series of recent changes to U.S. immunization policy under the new Health and Human Services leadership.</p>

However, Zelenskyy remains cautious, stating that Putin appears to be preparing for new military offensives despite the upcoming U.S.-Russia peace summit in Alaska.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly rebuked Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should either replace his chief economist or concentrate on his side career as a DJ. The criticism was a direct response to a Goldman Sachs research note which concluded that American consumers will increasingly bear the cost of the administration's tariffs. Trump countered this by asserting that the tariffs are mostly paid by foreign entities and are generating substantial revenue for the U.S. Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

While these loans are federally regulated, borrowers must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and home maintenance to avoid defaulting on the loan, which could lead to foreclosure. Furthermore, the loan balance grows over time as interest and fees accumulate, which can substantially reduce the equity available for heirs or future needs. (not investment advice)</p>
