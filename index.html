          <p>Affirm's stock experienced an 8% decline after the company projected revenue between $815 million and $845 million for the current quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations, despite reporting better-than-expected profits for the previous quarter. While the company's key margin metric, revenue less transaction costs, slightly exceeded its long-term target range, and gross merchandise volume surpassed estimates, the weaker guidance raised concerns among investors. Affirm's CEO, Max Levchin, highlighted the success of 0% interest loans in attracting new customers and boosting lifetime value, and CFO Rob O'Hare noted stable credit outcomes, despite broader economic contractions and lower-income consumers focusing on essentials. Affirm reaffirmed its commitment to GAAP profitability by the end of fiscal year 2025 and continues to see growth from partnerships with Apple, Amazon, and Shopify.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Rupnow, a Wisconsin father, has been arrested and charged with felonies for providing his 15-year-old daughter, Natalie Rupnow, with the firearm used in the Abundant Life Christian School shooting last year. Rupnow is charged with contributing to the delinquency of a child and two counts of providing a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 resulting in death. Police investigations revealed that Natalie Rupnow had regular access to a gun safe and multiple weapons in the home, and she harbored an obsession with mass violence, school shootings, and weapons. The 2024 shooting resulted in the deaths of two people and injuries to at least six others, with one student still hospitalized five months after the event, and Natalie Rupnow died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to cut a $56 million grant that supports first responders' training in using naloxone, a lifesaving drug that reverses opioid overdoses. This proposal comes despite a recent decrease in overdose deaths, attributed in part to wider naloxone access, which became available over-the-counter in 2023. Experts warn that these cuts could undermine progress made in combating the opioid crisis, potentially exacerbating the issue as states face budget constraints. The administration proposes cutting $33.3 billion from the Health and Human Services budget in 2026, eliminating SAMHSA, which oversees the naloxone grant, while focusing on fentanyl interdiction through tariffs on countries involved in its trafficking.</p>

Executives view trade turmoil as an opportunity for increased integration between the two economies, which they see as complementary, with manufacturing job creation in Mexico correlated with job creation in the US. Mexico is also perceived as a strategic opportunity due to its proximity to the US, young demographics, and large pension system.</p>

CEO Bill Ready emphasized the company's transformation into a shopping destination, particularly for Gen Z, and CFO Julia Brau Donnelly acknowledged the impact of tariffs on some Asia-based e-commerce retailers' advertising spend, but expressed optimism about Pinterest's advertising products and overall business health.

          <p>A Colorado football fan, Eric Jackson, is suing the NFL for $100 million, alleging "severe emotional distress and trauma" due to Shedeur Sanders' unexpected drop to the fifth round of the NFL draft. Jackson claims the NFL violated antitrust and civil rights laws, citing collusion and race discrimination, and misrepresented the drafting process. Legal experts, however, view the lawsuit as unlikely to succeed, citing issues of standing and the lack of a quantifiable harm. Sanders, son of Hall of Fame player Deion Sanders, was projected as a potential first-round pick but was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns at No. 144 overall.</p>

          <p>Alexander Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, received a 12-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to commodities fraud and manipulating the Celsius token, marking a significant downfall for a once-prominent figure in the crypto industry. Mashinsky was arrested in 2023 on charges of securities, commodities, and wire fraud, coinciding with Celsius reaching a $4.7 billion settlement with the FTC for misleading investors about the safety and profitability of its platform. His sentencing mirrors similar fates of other crypto executives like Sam Bankman-Fried and Do Kwon, while Binance's Changpeng Zhao also faced legal repercussions but has since pivoted to align with the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance.

          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce import taxes on British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. The deal offers relief for key UK industries from tariffs imposed by President Trump, although a 10% duty will remain on most goods from the UK. The US will reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year, while tariffs on steel and aluminum will also be slashed. The two sides have also agreed to reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>

          <p>World Central Kitchen (WCK) has been forced to close its community soup kitchens across Gaza due to the ongoing Israeli blockade of humanitarian assistance. The organization, which was serving 133,000 meals per day, reports that there is almost no food left in Gaza with which to cook, exacerbating the already dire hunger situation. Israel imposed the blockade on March 2, and aid agencies say supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition are running out. WCK is urging that humanitarian aid be allowed to flow into Gaza, with trucks loaded with food and supplies waiting in Egypt, Jordan, and Israel.</p>

          <p>Following an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, West Point has altered its curriculum, leading to canceled classes and book bans that sparked controversy. The order directed military academies to remove ideologies deemed "divisive" by President Trump. Some professors say the school initiated a push to remove readings on race, gender, or darker aspects of American history, leading to resignations and concerns about academic freedom. The NYTimes article indicates that two classes were scrapped for noncompliance, and a professor was told not to mention atrocities against Native Americans. The piece raises questions about balancing academic freedom with military obligations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration released 60,000 pages of records on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, the second tranche of documents ordered by President Trump and backed by RFK Jr. The documents include witness interviews, FBI memos, and a 2012 letter from RFK Jr. urging a probe into his father's death. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence digitized these records, which had been in storage for decades.

          <p>Economic data suggests that many companies plan to pass tariff costs on to consumers, potentially leading to rising prices, despite President Trump's claim that exporters will bear the burden. Surveys indicate that a majority of Texas manufacturers and executives anticipate passing tariff-related costs to customers. The Center for American Progress estimates that tariffs could cost households an average of $5,200 annually, with manufacturers expecting a 3.6% price increase over the next 12 months. While tariffs have yet to significantly impact prices, experts anticipate a shift upwards in inflation, affecting consumer activity and economic growth.</p>

Mr. Trump visited North Carolina in January, after parts of the state had been devastated by Hurricane Helene, and said that FEMA under President Joseph R.
