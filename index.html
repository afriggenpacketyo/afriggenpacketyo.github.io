          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in two deaths and at least 19 injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly experienced mechanical issues, causing it to veer off course and strike the bridge. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the injured were transported to local hospitals while the bridge was briefly closed for inspection but no major damage was found. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a full investigation into the incident, and this is not the first time a tall ship has struck the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling the move "theft" and expressing feeling "incredibly betrayed." He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment would rob young artists of their income and legacy. The government defended its position, stating that no changes to copyright laws would be considered unless they work for creators. Sir Elton warned that he is prepared to take ministers to court if the plans are not changed, and the article includes a statement from the chief executive of UK music that the government is on the brink of offering up the country's music industry as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that the Trump family's blatant profiteering from foreign entities is a symptom of a deeper issue in American politics, where foreign regimes and oligarchs manipulate policymakers through financial means. The article highlights instances of the Trump family securing deals with kleptocratic clients, such as the Executive Branch club and cryptocurrency ventures. It also draws parallels to past administrations, including the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden's dealings, suggesting a bipartisan trend of exploiting political connections for personal gain. Michel calls for legislative reforms to prevent foreign lobbying and financial arrangements by politicians' families, and for future administrations to enforce existing anti-corruption measures.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts Europe's revitalized sleeper train network with America's continued reliance on cars and planes. He highlights Europe's investment in high-speed rail, driven by climate concerns, while the United States struggles with underfunded public infrastructure and a car-centric culture. The article criticizes America's focus on unproven transit projects, like the Hyperloop, instead of improving existing rail systems. Richards advocates for revitalizing American railways to offer a more sustainable and communal travel experience, fostering connection and shared purpose among citizens. The future of travel depends on a commitment to infrastructure and a shift away from environmentally ruinous options.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night in Chicago on Friday. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning for the city for the first time, as visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was caused by strong winds lifting dry soil from parched farmland. Similar conditions led to a deadly crash in 2023, and the current soil moisture levels are critically low.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts under President Trump's agenda are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. Advocates fear that the changes will disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, while Republicans insist that the cuts will only eliminate fraud and waste, but not reduce coverage for those who need it. Individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, and Jodie Montplaisir, who is recovering from opioid use disorder, worry that the changes could jeopardize their access to essential medical care and services.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reshaping American foreign policy in the Middle East by engaging with countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, often without involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This shift is evident in Trump's recent actions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria and negotiating deals with Iran and Yemen, sidelining Israel's traditional role in the region. While the U.S. maintains its ties with Israel, Trump's focus on Gulf States for economic and strategic reasons signals a new dynamic where Netanyahu's influence is diminished, particularly regarding the Gaza conflict and Iran's nuclear program.</p>

This hostile media landscape, combined with the divisive legacy of Brexit, makes it difficult for Starmer to navigate the issue.

          <p>The CBS show "48 Hours" is set to air a new episode titled "The Footprint" on May 17, which will delve into the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis. The case involves a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints found at the crime scene, indicating the killer was barefoot. The episode will detail the investigation, the discovery of unknown DNA, and the use of investigative genetic genealogy to identify a suspect, Jerry Westrom. The show promises to explore how these footprints ultimately led to Jeanie Childs' killer.</p>

          <p>The case of Jeanie Childs, murdered in 1993, was reopened decades later when a new forensic scientist discovered an unknown DNA profile repeated throughout the crime scene. The DNA was linked to Jerry Westrom, a married father of three with no prior violent criminal history. Westrom's DNA was found on a comforter, towel, washcloth, T-shirt, and the bathroom sink, and his footprints matched those left at the scene. Despite Westrom's denial and lack of a murder weapon, he was arrested and charged with Childs' murder, and it was later determined that he was in fact guilty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for its announcement that tariffs would force the retailer to raise prices, stating that the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Trump called on Walmart to "EAT THE TARIFFS" and keep prices down, arguing that the company made billions of dollars last year. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible, but acknowledged the difficulty of absorbing all the pressure imposed by the tariffs, and this article touches on the economic impact that the trade war has on a subset of the market.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes across the Midwest and South have resulted in at least 26 deaths, with significant damage reported in Kentucky and Missouri. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear announced 18 deaths in his state, while Missouri reported seven fatalities. The storms, part of a larger weather system, also brought tornadoes to Wisconsin and extreme heat to Texas. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has offered federal resources to the affected states. The National Weather Service is facing staffing shortages, complicating disaster relief efforts, but officials in Kentucky and Missouri have praised the response from the White House and FEMA.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes this approach is more impactful than lenient sentences. The proposal involves probation teams collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The money earned would be allocated to a fund for victims' groups. This initiative aims to address prison overcrowding while ensuring that punishment is more than just a "soft option" and that the offenders are helping the public.</p>

          <p>As President Trump concludes his tour of the Gulf region, attention is shifting to the deals made during the trip, which include agreements for US companies and targeted investments. Experts note that Trump's receipt of overseas gifts and targeted investments are "unprecedented" as the White House remakes US foreign policy under a pay-for-access code. The agreements struck by major US companies saw prominent executives negotiate their deals face-to-face with Gulf country leaders. Many of those agreements broke with the policies of Joe Bidenâ€™s administration, which imposed strict controls on the sales of the USâ€™s most cutting-edge technology.</p>

          <p>A first date in Farmersville, Illinois turned into a nightmare when Leslie Reeves was murdered and Chris Smith was critically wounded in a shooting. Smith, who survived but lost his memory of the event, says that he wishes to remember something, anything, but is unable to. The investigation led to Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who lied about his whereabouts that night. Tarr claimed he was at Smith's house, but he insists it was Reeves's gun that was used. Tarr has since been found guilty of murder and attempted murder.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, failed to impress, finishing 19th out of 26, despite strong vocals and West End experience. The song, "What the Hell Just Happened," was criticized for its manic and inconsistent style, lacking a clear hook for viewers to latch onto. Staging, while creative, lacked the scale and impact of other performances, with the camp and fun elements not enough to capture the public vote. The result highlights the challenges the UK faces in Eurovision, requiring a balance of talent, song selection, and staging to resonate with a diverse European audience.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but limited its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions. The decision requires Novavax to conduct additional studies on heart conditions, potentially costing tens of millions of dollars.

The move has sparked concerns about the future availability and affordability of vaccines, as well as the potential impact on public confidence.</p>
