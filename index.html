        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite political and economic challenges, the established onshore wind industry in the U.S. is a significant energy source, generating nearly 11% of the nation's electricity. As the infrastructure ages, repowering efforts, involving upgrading or replacing old turbines, are creating new business opportunities for companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. Repowering offers economic benefits such as avoiding property acquisition and increasing electricity output by up to 50% with technologically advanced models. Recycling turbine components is also becoming a growing industry, addressing the disposal of decommissioned blades and other materials. (not investment advice)</p>
