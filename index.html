          <p>England's national women's football team, the Lionesses, began their Euro 2025 title defense with a disappointing 2-1 loss to France. Pundits and players described the performance as timid and error-prone, with England being largely outplayed in the midfield and defense for most of the match. First-half goals from Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Sandy Baltimore secured the victory for France, despite a late consolation goal from England's Keira Walsh. The defeat puts the defending champions in a difficult position early in the group stage, needing strong results in their upcoming matches to advance.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 43 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for dozens still missing, including 27 children from a summer camp.

Governor Greg Abbott has expanded the disaster declaration, and federal support has been promised to aid the extensive recovery efforts. Officials described the event as unforeseen in its intensity, leaving the region to grapple with immense loss and destruction.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in an attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, an incident the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation attributed to Hamas. This occurred as Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people in the region, including a doctor and his children. The violence continues alongside diplomatic efforts, with Hamas giving a "positive" but conditional response to a U.S.-proposed 60-day truce. Meanwhile, ten other Palestinians were reportedly killed while seeking food near aid distribution points, highlighting the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>Young people across the UK are finding it difficult to secure summer jobs, often facing the classic dilemma of needing experience to get experience. Careers experts advise applicants to overcome this by highlighting skills learned through other activities, such as volunteering, sports, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple, tailoring cover letters to the specific role, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While online applications have increased competition, experts say that speculatively dropping off a CV at smaller businesses can still be an effective way to show initiative.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting he strategically uses unpredictability, a concept political scientists call the "Madman Theory." By appearing temperamentally capable of anything, he aims to coerce adversaries and allies into making concessions, a tactic he believes is effective. The approach has yielded results, such as compelling NATO allies to increase defense spending, but its long-term success, especially against adversaries like Russia and Iran, remains questionable. Critics worry this doctrine could undermine trust in the U.S. as a reliable partner and potentially backfire by making his actions more predictable based on established character traits.</p>

While savers can receive a 25% government bonus on up to £4,000 saved annually, the product has significant pitfalls. Critics point to a harsh penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers their own money and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not changed since 2017.

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the start of the recent 12-day conflict with Israel, according to state media. He was shown on television greeting worshippers at a Tehran mosque, ending speculation about his whereabouts during the war, in which top Iranian commanders were killed. During the conflict, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages. His appearance, a day before the Shia festival of Ashura, dominated Iranian media coverage, with supporters expressing joy at seeing him in public again.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. The research indicates that these environmental stressors, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change, can impact the health of both the mother and the developing fetus. The findings highlight an emerging public health concern, suggesting that pregnant individuals are a particularly vulnerable population. This adds to a growing body of evidence on the wide-ranging health consequences of a changing climate.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party," following a public poll on his social media platform, X. The move comes after a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, which Musk heavily criticized. Musk stated the party aims to give Americans "back your freedom" and could serve as a deciding vote in Congress by targeting a small number of key seats. The billionaire, a major political donor, suggested the party would caucus independently and engage with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and subsequently released from the hospital after responding to a call at an ICE detention facility late on July 4th. Police encountered a person who appeared to be armed, and then an unknown number of suspects opened fire. Several armed suspects, some reportedly wearing body armor, were taken into custody after a pursuit. A federal source indicated that over a dozen masked individuals had vandalized the facility and launched fireworks, possibly to lure law enforcement to the scene before the shooting.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as Western nations seek to reset relations following the collapse of the Assad regime. The new Islamic-led government, which includes former members of a proscribed terrorist group, has prompted international concern over human rights and stability. Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future," engaging with the new government to encourage inclusivity and peace, and will use humanitarian aid to support this goal. The visit comes amid reports of attacks on minority groups and restrictions on social freedoms under the new leadership.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees for three years. The action followed an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon delivered by the trustee just days after the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel. The sermon included a hadith about Muslims fighting Jews, which the regulator found was delivered without appropriate context and stoked division, amounting to misconduct. The commission emphasized that charities are expected to bring people together, not promote hate, especially during times of conflict.</p>

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards performed 350 rescues on the Fourth of July holiday as dangerous rip currents created hazardous swimming conditions. In one major incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than ten people far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and helicopters. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for coastal areas throughout Southern California for the holiday weekend. The event serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers of ocean swimming during periods of elevated surf.</p>

Another raid targeted a popular food vendor in Eagle Rock.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly halted a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles, based on what Democrats call baseless concerns about low U.S. weapon stockpiles. This marks the third time Hegseth has paused supplies, a decision made unilaterally that surprised Congress and allies. While President Trump cited the need to replenish domestic supplies, Pentagon officials seemed to confirm the military has what it needs, and Democratic leaders assert that stockpile numbers do not justify the pause. The delay comes as Russia intensifies its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.</p>
