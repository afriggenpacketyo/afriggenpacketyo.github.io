          <p>A devastating fire at Gabriel House, an assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, resulted in nine deaths and one critical injury. Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon described the incident as an "unfathomable tragedy," with first responders heroically rescuing numerous residents from the heavily smoked three-story building. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, though it does not appear to be suspicious at this time. The community is grappling with profound loss, while union officials have raised concerns about fire department understaffing during the incident, suggesting it impacted rescue efforts. This article highlights the immediate aftermath and human toll of the disaster.</p>

          <p>China's economy experienced a slowdown in its second-quarter GDP growth, expanding by 5.2%, slightly above estimates but decelerating from the previous quarter. The nation faces significant challenges, including persistent trade tensions with the US, deflationary pressures, and a prolonged housing market downturn. Economists are increasingly advocating for Beijing to implement substantial stimulus measures to underpin growth and address underlying economic fragility. The article underscores the urgent need for structural reforms to ensure more balanced and sustainable economic expansion in the face of these formidable obstacles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling H20 graphics processing chips in China, alongside the introduction of a new, fully compliant RTX PRO GPU for the country. This strategic move aligns with US export restrictions, with the US government reportedly assuring Nvidia that necessary licenses will be granted for these deliveries. CEO Jensen Huang's visit to Beijing underscores the company's commitment to navigating the complex Chinese market. This development signals Nvidia's adaptive approach to ongoing tech trade tensions, aiming to maintain its presence while adhering to regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the US will supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry, including Patriot air defense systems, through NATO countries, with European allies funding the replacements. He also threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This marks a notable shift in his administration's approach, aiming to pressure Russia and bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. The announcement signals a more assertive stance from the US president towards ending the ongoing conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report, which lists top earners, is noted for presenting an incomplete picture of talent remuneration, as many prominent stars are absent from the list. This omission occurs because numerous high-profile individuals are contracted through external production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios, rather than being directly employed. This contractual arrangement allows BBC Studios to compete commercially without disclosing salaries, making it difficult to ascertain the full extent of top talent earnings from licence fee money. The article highlights ongoing transparency issues within the public broadcaster's financial disclosures.</p>

Researchers note that flavored and colorful packaging may inadvertently attract children, and these ingestions are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospital admissions.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June ever for shipping container traffic, processing nearly 900,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. This unprecedented surge is largely attributed to a 'tariff whipsaw effect,' as shippers rushed to beat President Trump's trade tax deadlines, particularly a mid-August deadline for Chinese goods. While the port's executive director expects cargo volume to ease after the new tariffs are in place, the situation highlights significant cost increases for importers. The article notes a changing landscape of sourcing and strategic adjustments by businesses navigating trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

PayPal, for instance, anticipates minimal short-term impact due to existing long-term pricing contracts.
