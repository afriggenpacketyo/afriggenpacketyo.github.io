          <p>President Trump is reportedly seeking a comprehensive deal with South Korea that bundles trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single negotiation, which he calls 'one-stop shopping.' This approach involves linking defense payments to trade talks, potentially altering the dynamics of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. While South Korean officials have indicated that defense payments are off the table, Trump's transactional approach could damage U.S. credibility and lead allies to perceive U.S. commitments as less reliable. One potential solution is for South Korea to increase its investment in its own forces and purchase more U.S. military equipment.</p>

          <p>A significant amount of private data, including criminal records, has been stolen from the Legal Aid Agency's online system in a cyberattack. The Ministry of Justice has urged individuals who applied for legal aid since 2010 to take precautions to protect themselves. The compromised data may include contact details, addresses, dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment status, and financial information. The ministry is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies to investigate the breach, and the LAA's online services have been taken offline.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household using gas and electricity will fall by Â£129 annually, a nearly 7% reduction. This decrease would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russian forces are expanding military infrastructure near the Finnish border, a move confirmed by NATO officials. The buildup includes new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, renovated fighter jet shelters, and construction on a helicopter base. While these developments are not on the scale of the buildup before the Ukraine invasion, they reflect Moscow's perception of a threat from NATO expansion, as the Finnish border now represents the alliance's longest contact line with Russia. Military analysts predict the region could become a hotspot, especially in the Arctic Circle.</p>

Children are recruited for cheap labor and sexual exploitation, often trafficked from neighboring countries with false promises of employment. The report details instances of sexual assault by adult miners, with children being forced into sexual acts in exchange for money or protection. Mining researcher Makhotla Sefuli emphasizes that criminal gangs specifically target children, who are easier to manipulate and cheaper to exploit, while the police and the Department of Social Development have not responded to requests for comment on the allegations.</p>
