          <p>Hong Kong is actively seeking to attract high-spending tourists to rejuvenate its economy, which has been affected by protests, pandemic restrictions, and security crackdowns. The city aims to broaden its appeal beyond budget-conscious visitors from mainland China by improving its image and offerings. Hong Kong is focusing on attracting wealthier tourists to boost revenue and revitalize the tourism sector. The effort involves addressing the negative perceptions and enhancing the overall visitor experience, thereby repositioning Hong Kong as a premier destination for affluent travelers. The city hopes that by catering to a more diverse and higher-spending demographic, it can secure its position as a vibrant and attractive tourist hub. </p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) regarding its handling of a neo-Nazi agent, leading IPCO to rewrite a report. The initial draft of the report contradicted false evidence MI5 had presented in court, but the final version omitted this contradiction after MI5 denied departing from its secrecy policy. The BBC's investigation revealed that MI5 had attempted to cover for a violent agent with paedophilic tendencies, and the Director General of MI5 has since apologized to IPCO. This revelation raises concerns about MI5's accountability and IPCO's ability to effectively oversee the Security Service's activities.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, aiming to reduce dependencies on the United States for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron have emphasized the need for Europe to shape the new international order and achieve strategic autonomy. The EU has sought economic concessions from Beijing, but the consensus in Brussels is that China has not reciprocated, further driving the push for European independence. This move reflects a desire for greater control over its future and a more prominent role in global affairs.</p>

          <p>A man from southern England discovered that he had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago after noticing discrepancies in his family's genealogy. He used DNA testing to uncover the truth, which his father never learned before his death last year. The BBC is aware of five similar cases of babies being mistakenly switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s, and lawyers anticipate more cases will emerge due to the rise in affordable genetic testing. This incident highlights the importance of accurate identification procedures in hospitals and the potential for long-hidden secrets to be revealed through modern technology.</p>

          <p>Global spirit makers are confronting a mix of challenges, including tariffs and shifts in consumer drinking habits. RÃ©my Cointreau recently withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties, following similar moves by Diageo and Pernod Ricard. The cognac business has been particularly affected by ongoing U.S.-China tensions, with sales declining due to slowing U.S. consumption and complex market conditions in China. Trade barriers are exacerbating already weakening demand for spirits, impacting the performance of major players in the industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The agreement allows each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and allocates $2.7 billion to former players barred from revenue for years. This decision is expected to professionalize college athletics, with high-stakes recruitment and potential program cuts. The ruling brings substantial changes to the NCAA's landscape, impacting nearly 500,000 athletes across 1,100 member schools.</p>
