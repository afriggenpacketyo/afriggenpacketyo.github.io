          <p>Verizon has named Dan Schulman, the former chief executive of PayPal, as its new CEO, succeeding Hans Vestberg who has led the company since 2018. Following the announcement, Verizon's shares experienced a slight increase in value. To ensure a seamless leadership change, Vestberg will remain on the board of directors and serve as a special advisor through October 2026. The company also announced that Mark Bertolini will take on the role of chairman of the board, further reshaping its corporate governance structure as it moves forward with strategic acquisitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has resumed processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, ending a temporary pause that began in July. This decision comes after the program was halted while the Department of Education assessed the impact of court decisions blocking the Biden-era SAVE plan. Consumer advocates have confirmed that eligible borrowers, who have been making payments for over two decades, are now receiving notices of their debt cancellation. However, significant backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, indicating broader systemic challenges.</p>

          <p>The government of Eswatini has confirmed the arrival of ten more individuals deported from the United States under a controversial third-country removal agreement. This marks the second such group sent to the southern African nation, a practice that human rights organizations and lawyers have condemned as a violation of migrants' rights. The deportees, who include nationals from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia, have no connection to Eswatini and are being held in a secure facility. The deal has prompted legal challenges within Eswatini, with critics arguing the process lacks transparency and legal justification.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party in the UK has announced a proposal to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to young people in their first job, intended to help them save for a home deposit. The plan, dubbed the First Job Bonus, would redirect the first £5,000 of an individual's National Insurance contributions into a savings account. To fund this and other pledges, such as abolishing business rates for many high street shops, the party outlined £47 billion in annual savings derived from cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid.

The application offers commission-free trading for over 2,000 stocks and ETFs, in addition to major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. The platform also includes yield-bearing accounts, providing a 4% annual percentage yield on cash deposits to attract a broad user base.

          <p>Three men have been jailed for their roles in a violent protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, Essex. The court heard that the demonstration, motivated by hostility following sexual assaults committed by an asylum seeker, descended into serious disorder where police officers were pushed, punched, and kicked. Stuart Williams, Dean Smith, and Martin Peagram all admitted to violent disorder. A senior police officer described the event as a scale of disorder unprecedented in his 20-year career in Essex, highlighting the severe community tensions.</p>

          <p>This article provides a first-hand account from Dr. Tsion Firew of Rwanda's model response to the 2024 Marburg virus outbreak, which achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for the disease. The success is attributed to a swift, science-driven government effort that included rapid testing, isolation wards, and the deployment of experimental vaccines and treatments. The physician contrasts this coordinated response with her experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Her story highlights the harrowing personal toll on healthcare workers while celebrating a public health victory achieved through decisive action and international collaboration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy is currently in a confusing state, described by some analysts as a "rolling recession" where different sectors experience downturns at different times. While overall GDP growth remains strong, driven by a boom in AI investment, other areas like manufacturing, housing, and agriculture are contracting. This creates a contradictory picture, as businesses implement hiring freezes and jobless rates rise, yet consumer spending holds steady. The ongoing government shutdown further complicates the outlook, threatening to tip a fragile and uneven economy into a broader downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old intensive care nurse in Merseyside had her leg amputated after a persistent pain behind her knee, initially dismissed as a muscle injury, was diagnosed as an extremely rare spindle cell sarcoma. Sophie Fay sought further medical help when her calf became severely swollen, leading to an MRI that revealed a large tumor. Due to the tumor encasing blood vessels and nerves, an above-the-knee amputation was the only viable treatment. She is now sharing her story during Bone Cancer Awareness Week to highlight the symptoms and advocate for better diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's ambitious Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program is facing significant challenges as sea trials for its prototype vessel, the Hai Kun, have fallen behind schedule. The submarine, a key component of Taiwan's strategy to enhance its asymmetric naval defenses, has spent an unexpectedly long time in dry dock after its initial surface tests. These delays are raising serious questions about whether the high-stakes project can meet its operational targets. The program is considered one of the most critical and complex defense initiatives undertaken by the island in decades.</p>

          <p>An article discussing Chuck Collins' new book, "Burned by Billionaires," delves into the mechanisms that drive wealth inequality in the United States. Collins argues the economic system is intentionally designed to channel wealth upward, facilitated by a sophisticated "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants who minimize taxes for the ultra-rich. This concentration of wealth then translates into political power, allowing the wealthy to shape policies that further protect their assets. The book contends that this cycle of hyper-extraction harms everyday Americans through increased costs for essentials like healthcare and housing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to rescind the "roadless rule," a landmark environmental protection established in 1999 that has safeguarded 58 million acres of U.S. national forests from new roads and logging. Officials argue the rule is overly restrictive, while environmental advocates warn that its removal will devastate critical ecosystems, threaten drinking water sources for millions, and release vast carbon stores. The move is part of a broader push by the administration to increase timber harvesting on federal lands, which critics describe as a chaotic and short-sighted approach.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the far-reaching consequences of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling in Trump v. United States, which granted former presidents a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts. The author argues that this decision diverges from the global legal trend toward holding leaders accountable for international crimes, such as torture and genocide, as established in the Pinochet case. The ruling creates ambiguity that could be exploited by authoritarian leaders worldwide and may undermine future U.S. efforts to promote international justice, weakening the principle that no one is above the law.</p>

This move mirrors the career end of another Hall of Famer, Greg Maddux, who also finished his career as a reliever with the Dodgers in 2008. Despite still being highly effective, Kershaw is part of a deep Dodgers rotation with five other available starters boasting better ERAs this season. The team's management and Kershaw himself have framed the decision as a pragmatic choice to do whatever it takes to win.</p>

          <p>Shares of British luxury automaker Aston Martin plummeted by as much as 10% after the company issued a profit warning and lowered its 2025 forecast. The carmaker cited a challenging industry outlook and significant uncertainty created by U.S. tariffs on British-made vehicles as key factors. The company stated that the complexity of the tariff quota system limits its ability to forecast accurately and called for more proactive support from the U.K. government. Aston Martin also announced it no longer expects to generate positive free cash flow in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vilnius Airport, Lithuania's main international gateway, was forced to shut down for several hours after its airspace was violated by dozens of meteorological balloons launched from neighboring Belarus. The balloons were part of a smuggling operation, carrying thousands of packs of black-market cigarettes. The incident led to the cancellation of 30 flights, affecting 6,000 passengers. Lithuanian officials noted that this rudimentary smuggling method, while susceptible to weather, is becoming more common due to the low cost of the balloons compared to drones, posing a growing risk to civil aviation.</p>
