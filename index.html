          <p>The United States has officially confirmed it will cease funding Gavi, the global vaccine alliance, marking a significant shift in American foreign policy. In a speech to a Gavi summit, Robert F.

Gavi, which has vaccinated over a billion children and saved an estimated 19 million lives, warns that the loss of its third-largest donor could lead to the deaths of more than a million children.</p>

          <p>German politicians are pushing to establish an inquiry commission to investigate the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inquiry would scrutinize actions such as the large-scale procurement of overpriced face masks by former Health Minister Jens Spahn and the impact of lockdowns on the economy and society. Proponents, including virologist and parliamentarian Hendrik Streeck, argue a review is necessary to regain public trust, learn lessons for future crises, and understand how scientific advice influenced political decisions. The commission could begin its work as early as September 2025.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the movie 'Rust' following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The lawsuit alleged negligence and sought compensation for emotional distress from the film's producers, including lead actor Alec Baldwin. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed convicted of involuntary manslaughter, while a similar charge against Baldwin was dismissed last year, though he was later indicted again.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he kicked a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old detector dog, Freddie, alerted to the man's suitcase during a baggage inspection. The man kicked the 25-pound dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. Authorities discovered over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products in his luggage. The man was ordered to pay the dog's vet bill and will be deported to Egypt.</p>

The measure, which invoked the 1973 War Powers Resolution, was defeated in a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine introduced the resolution, arguing for the necessity of congressional oversight on matters of war, especially given the fragile nature of the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

          <p>This article reflects on the year since Joe Biden's challenging debate performance against Donald Trump, an event that shattered many Democrats' hopes for the 2024 election. The piece argues that the party has since been in a state of disarray, struggling with internal divisions and a lack of clear leadership following Trump's victory. It points to recent events, like the polarizing New York mayoral primary, as evidence of a rudderless party. The author suggests that Democrats must look toward the 2028 election to find a new national leader and move past the lingering trauma of 2024.</p>

          <p>This article compiles a series of bold and often controversial opinions on food and drinks from various writers. It highlights arguments against popular items like hard seltzers, which one writer deemed simply 'bad,' and wraps, which another called 'the worst kind of sandwich.' Conversely, the piece also notes defenses of oft-maligned foods, such as candy corn and milk chocolate, with one journalist bravely arguing for the latter's superiority over dark chocolate. The collection explores the cultural and social values Americans attach to what they choose to eat and drink.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the abrupt halt of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) by June 30, a decision scientists warn could severely cripple hurricane and climate forecasting. For over 40 years, the DMSP has provided crucial, high-resolution data for monitoring hurricane development and polar sea ice, and there is no adequate US replacement. Researchers inside and outside the government expressed shock at the sudden termination, stating it will immediately degrade forecasting capabilities just as hurricane season intensifies and Arctic sea ice reaches record lows.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying threats of legal consequences from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a police ban enacted under a new law that restricts gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. Participants, including EU Equalities Commissioner Hadja Lahbib and numerous European Parliament members, marched in a powerful show of solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community and civil society. Attendees risked fines, and organizers faced potential prison sentences for defying the ban, highlighting the growing pressure on LGBTQ rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Representative Don Bacon, a Republican from a Nebraska swing district, will not seek re-election, creating a significant opportunity for Democrats. The district, which includes Omaha, voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in the last two elections, making it a prime target for the party's efforts to regain a House majority. Bacon, a vocal critic of former President Trump on certain issues, has represented the district since 2017. His departure removes the advantage of incumbency for Republicans in a highly competitive race.</p>

For this year's event, the city has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions.

While some, like Donald Trump, have labeled him an extremist, others at a recent conservative conference expressed a grudging admiration for his effective grassroots campaign that defeated establishment figure Andrew Cuomo. Many attendees viewed his win as a phenomenon unique to liberal New York and dismissed the idea of his progressive agenda gaining traction nationally.

          <p>As Iran faces escalating conflict with the U.S. and Israel, it may seek weapons support from China, but a leading Chinese expert on the Middle East suggests Beijing will proceed with caution. Scholar Pan Guang states that China must balance its partnership with Tehran against its economic interests and relationships with Israel and other Western-aligned nations in the region. While tit-for-tat retaliation between Iran and Israel may continue, the conflict is unlikely to escalate into a broader war. The analysis highlights China's strategic interest in regional stability over taking a side in the conflict.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience suggests that homebuyers use the '80-10-10 Rule' to determine if a house is the right fit. This guideline posits that the ideal property will have 80% of the features a buyer loves and cannot change, like location and layout. Another 10% should consist of things that can be improved over time, such as paint or fixtures. The final 10% represents elements that are not ideal but are ultimately livable, like a neighbor's fence. The rule serves as a practical framework to manage expectations and avoid getting stuck searching for a nonexistent 'perfect' home.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be the cheapest they have been since 2021 this summer, according to a petroleum analyst. The national average price could fall below $3 a gallon as early as September. While a recent spike was driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, the subsequent ceasefire is expected to allow prices to resume a slow decline. Factors contributing to the drop include increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

While these military successes have decimated Iran's 'axis of resistance,' they have not resolved underlying political issues, particularly the Palestinian conflict, and have tarnished Israel's international reputation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
