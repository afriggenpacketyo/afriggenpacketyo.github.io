          <h2>Ukrainian Government Faces Public and International Criticism Over New Anti-Corruption Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:07:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine's government is confronting significant backlash after President Zelensky signed a law reducing the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The move has triggered the largest anti-government protests since the 2022 invasion and drawn expressions of concern from Western allies, including the European Union. Critics fear the law undermines Ukraine's fight against endemic corruption, a crucial requirement for its potential EU integration and a source of domestic and international frustration during the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has carried out nearly 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track for its highest annual total since the Obama administration. While this pace would exceed 300,000 removals in a year, it remains far below the administration's stated goal of one million. Officials suggest that a recent, unprecedented increase in funding for ICE could significantly expand deportation efforts in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully used CRISPR gene-editing technology to make a minor genetic change in mosquitoes that largely prevents the malaria parasite from reaching their salivary glands. This single amino acid alteration renders the insects highly resistant to spreading the disease. Scientists are hopeful that this trait can be spread through wild mosquito populations using a gene drive, representing a potentially major breakthrough, though the technology remains controversial due to possible ecological impacts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has announced it will remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal from all flu shots distributed in the country. The decision follows a recommendation from a recently restructured government vaccine advisory panel. This move is seen by many as a significant victory for the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous scientific studies over decades finding no evidence of harm from the ingredient.</p>
