          <p>A medical gel called TRAUMAGEL, invented by Joe Landolina when he was 17, is being used by first responders to stop severe bleeding from traumatic injuries almost instantly. The plant-based technology, derived from algae polymers, works in seconds and provides a critical tool for treating wounds in the field before a patient can be transported to a hospital. The gel has already been credited with saving a firefighter's life in Cobb County, Georgia, and is being studied by the U.S. Defense Department for potential applications in treating traumatic brain injuries. This innovation represents a significant advancement in emergency medical care.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant cooling as employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below economists' forecasts and continuing a recent slowdown. The unemployment rate increased slightly to 4.3%, while previous months' figures were revised, revealing a net job loss in June—the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty, particularly surrounding the Trump administration's tariffs, complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. The data points to mounting headwinds for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain American citizens, allowing the U.S. to impose punitive measures. This new policy, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, will provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations that use detained Americans for political leverage. The move aims to deter the practice of hostage-taking and has been praised by families of victims, such as that of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. It follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with countries like Russia and Iran.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military reports it has gained operational control over 40% of Gaza City and is intensifying its ground offensive, calling up 60,000 reservists for the operation. The assault has leveled entire neighborhoods and displaced thousands of families, exacerbating a severe humanitarian crisis, with experts already declaring a famine in the city. Despite international calls for a halt, including from the U.N. and allied governments, Israel plans to phase out aid to the city to compel the population to move south. This escalation comes nearly two years into the war, which has resulted in over 64,200 Palestinian deaths.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that any foreign military forces deployed in Ukraine would be viewed as legitimate targets for Moscow's army, escalating rhetoric amid the ongoing war. His comments came after European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, pledged to potentially provide a peacekeeping or 'reassurance' force as part of post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine. Putin dismissed the need for peacekeepers, asserting that Russia would honor any peace treaty.

Mayweather referred to the fight as an exhibition, suggesting it will not be professionally sanctioned or affect their official records. Key questions remain about the weight class and whether non-standard rules, like shorter rounds or heavier gloves, will be implemented given the fighters' ages.</p>

This new partnership significantly boosts Broadcom's AI revenue forecast for 2026, adding to its existing major clients like Google, Meta, and ByteDance.

This would create a one-on-one contest between Democratic socialist frontrunner Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Trump expressed his opposition to a 'communist' becoming mayor, and reports suggest the White House explored job offers to entice Adams and Sliwa to exit. Mamdani has since challenged Trump to a debate, while Cuomo continues to urge his opponents to consolidate the vote against Mamdani.</p>

          <p>India's Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has stated that the country will continue to purchase Russian oil as long as it remains economically advantageous. This decision comes despite the Trump administration imposing a 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly in response to India's energy trade with Moscow, which Washington argues helps fund Russia's war in Ukraine. Since the 2022 invasion, India has become the largest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, taking advantage of discounted prices. The minister emphasized that India's energy procurement is based on national interest, considering factors like price and logistics.</p>

          <p>A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 1.8 was recorded off the coast of Rhode Island late on September 4. The tremor occurred at 11:36 p.m. about three miles from Narragansett and at a depth of six miles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. While the earthquake was small, the USGS received a handful of reports from people who felt the shaking in various parts of Rhode Island, including Newport and Wakefield. Two reports even came from as far away as New York, demonstrating how seismic waves can sometimes travel significant distances despite the low magnitude of the event.</p>

The session was briefly interrupted by a red flag after gravel was brought onto the track, but both Ferrari drivers showed promising pace ahead of their Tifosi supporters.</p>

          <p>European stock markets traded higher on Friday after a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report reinforced investor expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The report, which showed the U.S. added only 22,000 jobs in August, led to a decline in the U.S. dollar and increased market bets that the Fed will lower rates at its upcoming September meeting. The regional Stoxx 600 index held its gains following the data release, as investors processed the implications of a cooling American labor market for global monetary policy. The news overshadowed company-specific updates, such as Orsted's revised earnings guidance.</p>

The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated that this amount will not even cover its own extensive legal costs incurred while pursuing the recovery. The loans, intended to finance ship-breaking operations, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the vessels used as collateral. This outcome marks another significant loss for the platform's customers, following recent wipeouts in several real estate deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the war in Ukraine must be resolved through diplomatic means within the framework of the United Nations, rather than through continued military conflict. Drawing a parallel to the escalation of World War II following an oil embargo on Japan, the author warns against the vicious cycle of war where actions are perceived as aggression by one side and an existential threat by the other. The article emphasizes that the core principles of the UN Charter, including international peace and sovereign equality, provide the necessary foundation for a lasting resolution that respects the security of all nations.</p>

          <p>The once-booming industrial real estate sector has hit a significant slowdown, with demand for warehouse space falling for the first time since 2010. A report from NAIOP indicates that net absorption dropped by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter, a stark reversal from the e-commerce-driven highs of the pandemic era. This decline is attributed to economic uncertainty fueled by shifting tariff policies and high inflation, which has caused businesses to pause expansion plans. While a recovery is forecast for 2026, the immediate outlook suggests that demand will remain nearly flat for the rest of the year.</p>

The company plans to 'uplift' about 1,000 locations by the end of 2026, incorporating features like cozier seating, less harsh lighting for those with light sensitivity, and other welcoming tweaks. This initiative marks a shift away from the minimalist, grab-and-go focus of recent years and aims to restore the cafes' reputation as a 'third place' for community gathering.

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur on September 7, 2025, and will be visible to observers across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. During the event, the Earth will pass directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the moon a distinct reddish or orange hue, often called a 'Blood Moon.' This coloration is caused by sunlight filtering through the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye and can last for a longer duration, offering a spectacular celestial event for skywatchers in the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's stock price plunged 20% after the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing a projected $240 million negative impact from U.S. tariffs. While second-quarter earnings beat estimates, the apparel retailer's revenue slightly missed expectations, and its guidance fell well below Wall Street's projections. CEO Calvin McDonald stated that increased tariff rates and the removal of the 'de minimis' exemption for smaller shipments were major factors in the reduced outlook. The company also acknowledged that some of its product offerings have become 'stale' and are not resonating with U.S. customers. (not investment advice)</p>
