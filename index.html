          <p>Hong Kong is bracing for Super Typhoon Ragasa, the year's strongest storm, leading to widespread disruptions and a city-wide shutdown. Schools and many businesses are closed, while Hong Kong International Airport has grounded most flights from Tuesday evening, with over 500 Cathay Pacific flights cancelled. Residents have stocked up on essentials, and shop owners are piling sandbags in preparation for the storm. The typhoon, which caused at least one death and displaced thousands in the Philippines, is expected to impact millions as it moves towards northern Vietnam and China's Guangdong province, where authorities anticipate a "catastrophic" situation. Hong Kong's Chief Secretary warned of serious threats, comparing Ragasa to past destructive typhoons that left trails of severe damage and significant economic losses. This powerful storm, equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, packed wind gusts up to 285km/h at its peak, underscoring the severity of the impending impact.</p>

          <p>A Washington D.C. man, Jacob Samuel Winkler, 33, faces federal charges for allegedly shining a laser pointer at Marine One, the presidential helicopter carrying President Trump, on Saturday. A U.S. Secret Service patrol officer observed Winkler acting erratically before he aimed the laser at the officer's face and then at the airborne helicopter. Authorities stated this action posed a significant risk of airborne collision by potentially blinding or disorienting a pilot. Winkler reportedly told investigators he points lasers at various objects and was unaware it was illegal to target Marine One. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro emphasized that such behavior endangers Marine One and everyone on board, vowing full prosecution for those who engage in this act. This incident highlights serious security concerns for presidential travel.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Lions secured a thrilling 38-30 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in a high-scoring Monday night NFL game, moving their record to 2-1. Detroit's offense was potent, rushing for 225 yards, with David Montgomery contributing 151 yards and two touchdowns, including a game-sealing 31-yard run. The Lions' defense also played a crucial role, sacking Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson seven times and forcing a key fumble late in the fourth quarter. This intense matchup, featuring two explosive offenses, saw both teams trade scores throughout, with Detroit ultimately pulling ahead in the final quarter. Quarterback Jared Goff completed 20 of 28 passes for 202 yards, while Amon-Ra St. Brown led receivers with 77 yards. The Ravens' late touchdown proved insufficient to overcome the Lions' dominant second-half performance, securing a significant road win.</p>

These expansive documents have historically guided China's growth for over seven decades, reflecting Beijing's strategic vision for economic and social progress. The upcoming iteration is expected to inform and reflect key policy shifts, especially in light of the significant economic changes since the reform era. Analysts are closely examining what to expect from this new plan, as it continues a long-standing tradition of central planning to steer the country's future direction and address evolving challenges. This process is particularly significant as China navigates global economic complexities and seeks to reinforce its long-term strategic goals.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen and Oslo airports were forced to temporarily close their airspaces after multiple unidentified drone sightings, causing significant flight disruptions and diversions. Danish police reported two to three large drones near Copenhagen Airport, leading to a four-hour suspension of flights and rerouting for at least 35 aircraft. Oslo Airport also closed its airspace for about four hours due to a similar drone observation. Authorities are currently investigating the origin and nature of these drones, with Danish police unable to confirm or deny if they were of Russian origin, despite a social media reference from Ukrainian President Zelensky. Both airports have since reopened, but passengers are advised to expect ongoing delays and cancellations as investigations continue into these security breaches.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a major Category 4 storm, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Located approximately 220 miles east of Bermuda, its center was expected to pass by Monday night, with the Azores archipelago urged to monitor its progress. Packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, Gabrielle is generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada. Although the 2025 hurricane season was initially predicted to be busier than average, activity has been quieter than anticipated. Officials at the National Hurricane Center continue to emphasize the importance of monitoring storm developments and taking necessary precautions for coastal residents in affected areas.</p>

          <p>Brazil's chief prosecutor has charged Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, with coercion, alleging he repeatedly subjected national interests to personal agendas and risked foreign sanctions. Eduardo, a congressman residing in the US, dismissed the charges as "bogus" and part of "ongoing political persecution." This development follows his father's recent 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup, intensifying the family's legal battles. US President Trump, an ally of Jair Bolsonaro, has imposed tariffs on Brazil and sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice's wife, further escalating international tensions. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Brazilians have protested against a proposed amnesty bill for the former president, with current President Lula vowing to veto it.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller, a key Trump administration advisor, delivered a controversial eulogy for Charlie Kirk, framing it as a battle cry against perceived enemies and depicting political opponents as "wickedness." The speech, which critics called a "jarring piece of rhetoric," emphasized the destruction of the opposing side and invoked pillars of Western civilization for political gain. Observers noted Miller's perceived hypocrisy in demanding standards from opponents he doesn't uphold himself. The article contrasts Miller's divisive message with Barack Obama's call for reconciliation after a similar tragedy, highlighting a deep ideological split in American politics where one side seeks to subjugate the other rather than bridge divides.</p>

          <p>Writer Jack Thorne praised the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the phone hacking scandal, ahead of ITV's new drama 'The Hack.' The series stars David Tennant as Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter who uncovered the extensive hacking at the News of the World. Thorne, who also penned 'Adolescence,' noted the story reveals a troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police, extending beyond just journalistic misconduct. Unlike the 'Mr Bates vs The Post Office' drama, which highlighted journalism's struggle to gain traction, 'The Hack' celebrates journalists holding their own industry accountable. The drama tells the story from two perspectives: Davies' reporting and police detective Dave Cook's investigation into private investigator Daniel Morgan's murder, highlighting the bravery required to expose wrongdoing within one's own sphere.</p>

          <p>China has decisively rejected Nvidia's B40-series chips, stripped-down versions of its advanced H20 line, which were intended as a compromise to maintain US technological lead while allowing China some access. Beijing's refusal, accompanied by antitrust investigations and security concerns, signals a turning point in global technology politics. Historically reliant on US supply chains, China's calculus shifted after sweeping US restrictions on high-end artificial intelligence chips. This move underscores China's renewed commitment to achieving technological self-reliance, transforming what once seemed a distant dream into a national necessity in the face of perceived US-dictated tech inferiority. The decision highlights a strategic pivot towards indigenous innovation, even if it means sacrificing immediate access to advanced foreign technology.</p>

          <p>Many couples experience a decline in sex drive and intimacy after childbirth, a common issue highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and medical experts. This can stem from significant physical healing for mothers, including uterine recovery and hormonal shifts like drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone, which can cause vaginal dryness and discomfort. Additionally, both parents may face emotional adjustments to parenthood, impacting their desire for sex. Open communication is crucial, as exemplified by Hagan-Blyth's experience, where discussing feelings with her husband alleviated pressure and improved their relationship. Medical professionals emphasize that the six-week postnatal check is not a definitive timeline for resuming sexual activity, and partners should support each other through these changes.</p>

Disney stated the suspension was due to "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, but reinstated the show after "thoughtful conversations."

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were suspended with unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. This decision expands an existing class-action lawsuit, which had already reversed tens of millions in grants from other federal agencies. The freeze, citing allegations of campus antisemitism and other issues, had threatened UCLA with layoffs and lab closures, impacting critical cancer and stroke research. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in challenging executive branch actions and protecting scientific funding, offering a crucial lifeline to researchers.</p>

The brief chase culminated in the truck crashing into a patrol car and a parked vehicle, though fortunately no one was injured. The boy was taken into custody and booked on multiple charges, including hit and run, assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer, reckless evasion, vehicle theft, and receiving a stolen vehicle. In California, 12 is the minimum age for criminal responsibility in juvenile court, and he is expected to be released to his parents while his case is reviewed by a probation officer.</p>

While animal tests have been crucial for developing life-saving drugs and vaccines, experts caution that current alternatives are not yet ready to fully replace them, raising concerns for patients with rare diseases who rely on ongoing research.</p>

          <h2>Autism Advocacy Groups Condemn Trump Administration's Tylenol-Autism Claims as Dangerous and Regressive</h2>

          <p>Autism experts and advocacy groups are strongly condemning the Trump administration's claim that Tylenol use during pregnancy causes autism, calling it dangerous and regressive. Organizations like the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and Balanced Learning Center emphasize that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition primarily linked to genetics, not a singular cause like medication. They criticize the administration's focus on a "cure" and "epidemic" rhetoric, which they argue dehumanizes autistic people and promotes stigma. Concerns were also raised about fast-tracking unproven treatments like leucovorin and the potential for creating guilt and anxiety among pregnant individuals, potentially leading them to avoid necessary medical care.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of President Trump, allowing him to dismiss Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) while legal challenges continue. In a 6-3 decision, the justices also agreed to revisit a nearly century-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor (1935), which shields independent agencies from presidential interference. Justice Elena Kagan, in dissent, warned that this ruling grants the president full control over agencies Congress intended to protect from partisanship, potentially extinguishing their bipartisanship and independence. The court will hear arguments in December, a decision that could significantly reshape the balance of power between the executive and independent federal bodies.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18.2 billion through its "Semiconductor Mission" to become a global chip major, aiming for a full supply chain from design to fabrication on Indian soil. This initiative, spurred by global semiconductor self-reliance efforts following US restrictions on China, seeks to reduce import dependence and capture a larger share of the electronics market. While India boasts engineering talent and has approved 10 projects, experts caution that more than just financial incentives are needed, including improvements in talent, tax, and trade policies. The government has also expanded support for electronic component manufacturing to create local demand, recognizing the long and challenging road ahead in competing with established chip powerhouses.

          <p>Rescuers are continuing their search for Billy Pierson, an experienced alpinist from Seattle, who has been missing since early September, possibly longer, in California’s remote Eastern Sierra. Pierson was believed to be attempting the challenging Palisades Traverse, a technical mountaineering route covering nearly 20 miles and crossing five peaks over 14,000 feet, including the Palisades Glacier. The Inyo County Sheriff’s Office and Search and Rescue have scoured the area around Temple Crag, a landmark where Pierson planned to start or end his trip, but without success. This incident follows other recent hiker tragedies in the Sierra, including a fatal fall on Mt. Shasta, underscoring the inherent dangers of the region's rugged and unforgiving terrain for even seasoned climbers.</p>

          <p>Representative Maxine Waters and civil rights activists have petitioned the United Nations to investigate the Trump administration's federal immigration raids, alleging "ethnic cleansing" and human rights violations against Latino minorities. The petition, filed on behalf of U.S. citizens and millions of Latino immigrants, accuses federal agents of "kidnapping arrests, prolonged detentions without due process, and brutal excessive use of force." Waters stated domestic efforts to halt these "roundups" have failed, citing Supreme Court rulings allowing agents to stop individuals based on appearance. Federal immigration authorities dismissed the petition as "dangerous rhetoric" that inflames tensions and inspires violence against law enforcement, while civil rights icon Dolores Huerta likened the current raids to the brutal "Operation Wetback" of the 1950s.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to classify Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," opening a new front in his battle against political foes and raising significant legal and ethical questions. The order directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle Antifa's "illegal operations" and target its funders, despite no evidence linking the Charlie Kirk murder suspect to the decentralized movement. Critics warn this action could punish dissent and infringe on First Amendment rights, noting that Antifa is a loose, leaderless affiliation rather than a structured group. Experts highlight that the U.S. lacks a domestic terrorism law and that far-right extremists have historically caused more fatalities in the U.S.</p>

          <p>City Thameslink in London has been identified as Britain's worst major railway station for train cancellations, with approximately one in 13 of its nearly 150,000 scheduled stops cancelled in the year to August. This contributes to around three million cancelled stops nationwide. Passengers, like student Cat Edge, experience significant stress and disruption, often being late for commitments due to smaller stations being skipped to make up time. While Thameslink and Network Rail expressed regret and cited efforts to improve reliability, issues like signaling faults, crew availability, and severe weather persist. The government aims to improve standards through railway renationalization, but the annual cancellation rate remains slightly higher than the previous year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that Tylenol use during pregnancy increases autism risk, unsupported by science, is seen by critics as part of a broader administration campaign to promote "natural" pregnancy and motherhood, often at the expense of women's health. This agenda has included undermining access to Covid vaccines and antidepressants for pregnant women, despite medical consensus on their benefits. Experts warn against the "appeal to nature" fallacy, which prioritizes human-made interventions. The article suggests this approach could lead to fewer options and more pain for women, fitting into a historical pattern of shaming mothers and diminishing the need for medical support during pregnancy and motherhood.</p>

          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey is urging the UK government to offer discount visas to US cancer scientists whose research funding has been cut by the Trump administration. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey proposed a fellowship scheme to attract scientists fleeing the US government's "anti-science agenda," particularly after billions were cut from biomedical research grants. This initiative, which aims to position the UK as a world leader in cancer research, comes amidst Davey's strong criticism of President Trump and his allies, including their stance on mRNA vaccines. The proposal seeks to capitalize on a poll indicating that 75% of Nature journal readers are considering leaving the US due to these actions, offering a strategic opportunity for the UK.</p>

          <p>The debate over freedom of speech has reached a boiling point in both the UK and US, marked by intense political polarization and differing interpretations of its limits. In the UK, Nigel Farage controversially compared the country's speech restrictions to North Korea, while a former childminder received a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred online, sparking discussions about policing online content. US Vice-President JD Vance and Forbes magazine also criticized the UK's approach. In the US, the assassination of Charlie Kirk further fueled arguments, with figures like President Trump simultaneously celebrating censorship of critics while threatening lawsuits himself. The article highlights a generational divide where younger people prioritize safety over absolute free speech online, and a lack of consensus on what constitutes hate speech versus protected expression.</p>
