          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's federalization of the California National Guard and deployment to Los Angeles was illegal, ordering him to return control to Governor Newsom. The judge, Charles Breyer, stayed the order temporarily to allow the Trump administration to appeal. Newsom and California's attorney general had sued to reverse Trump's action, arguing it was unprecedented and violated the Tenth Amendment. The judge agreed, stating that none of the conditions required for Trump's action were met and that it set a dangerous precedent. The ruling was praised by Newsom as a check on authoritarian tendencies, while the Trump administration sought to appeal the decision. Optimism score is proportional with the fact that the judge sided with the Governor. </p>

          <p>The United States has publicly distanced itself from Israeli military strikes in Iran, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that Israel took unilateral action. Rubio emphasized that the top priority for the U.S. is protecting American forces in the region and warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel. The Israeli strikes, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," targeted Iran's nuclear program and other military sites, according to the Israel Defense Force. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was necessary due to Iran's continued efforts to weaponize enriched uranium, while Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliation. The U.S. had partially evacuated embassy staff from Iraq and limited employee movement in Israel prior to the strikes. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>

          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, earlier than previously believed. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. Researchers found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, indicating domestication alongside rice cultivation. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score is based on the positive tone of scientific discovery and advancement of knowledge.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential chaos.

Critics warn that consolidation could increase the risk of catastrophic fires. The optimism score is low due to concerns about the potential disruptions and increased wildfire risks. </p>
