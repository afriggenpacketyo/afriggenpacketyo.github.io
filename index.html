President Trump's team, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met with Chinese counterparts led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. The U.S. is seeking confirmation that China will restore flows of critical minerals, while Trump has reportedly authorized his team to consider easing restrictions on sales of certain U.S. technologies.

          <p>The UK government has committed Â£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes.

However, critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue the true costs are not transparent and the project could increase consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review, with the project expected to take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement.

Governor Newsom has condemned the deployment as illegal and immoral, while LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the department's limited role in immigration enforcement due to California's sanctuary city laws.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite marking and administrative tasks, such as writing letters to parents. The Department for Education (DfE) advises teachers to be transparent about their use of AI and to always verify its results, using the technology for low-stakes marking and routine communications. While the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges AI's potential to free up time for face-to-face teaching, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors. The DfE emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its results.</p>
