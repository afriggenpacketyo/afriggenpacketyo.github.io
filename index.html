          <p>President Trump condemned Judge Boasberg and other judges deemed "radical left" for hindering his deportation efforts of violent illegal immigrants.  He emphasized the importance of law and order and swiftly removing criminals, aligning with his campaign promises.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) expressed concern over the resignation of Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccine official.  Marks cited misinformation and lies from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the reason for his departure. The article presents the situation factually, but the inclusion of quotes from BIO expressing concern suggests a potential bias against the Trump administration's actions.</p>
