          <p>Following the Oklahoma City Thunder's NBA Finals championship win, a shooting occurred near downtown Oklahoma City, resulting in one person being injured. Police responded to the incident on the west side of Scissortail Park shortly after the game concluded. The victim was transported to a local hospital and is expected to make a full recovery, according to authorities. The police described the scene as "hectic" due to the large number of people celebrating in the area, and an investigation is currently underway to find the suspects who fled on foot. Optimism remains low given the violence amidst celebration.</p>

          <p>Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani share the tragic story of their sister Paloma, who died from cancer after refusing chemotherapy due to their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories. Their mother, Kate Shemirani, was a nurse who was struck off for promoting misinformation about Covid-19, and she influenced Paloma's decision to reject conventional treatment. The brothers hope that by sharing their story, they can prevent other deaths and encourage social media companies to take stronger action against medical misinformation. The article highlights the growing concern among cancer doctors that these beliefs are becoming more mainstream, potentially causing more harm. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of medical misinformation and the importance of critical thinking.</p>

          <p>At an upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, member states are expected to commit to spending 5% of their economic output on defense by 2032, a significant increase from the current 2% target. Germany is facing pressure to bolster its military capabilities and increase troop numbers, potentially requiring an additional 50,000 to 60,000 soldiers. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz supports the increased spending, some members of his coalition government express skepticism about setting a specific GDP percentage for military expenditures. The debate also includes discussions on whether to reinstate conscription to meet NATO's growing demands, but the government is currently focused on voluntary enlistment programs. The article reflects a cautious outlook on Germany's ability to meet these ambitious goals.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has appealed to China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global shipping route. This appeal follows reports that Iran's parliament approved a plan to close the strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. China is a major buyer of Iranian oil and has a close relationship with Tehran, making its potential influence significant. Disruption to the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a surge in global oil prices, impacting economies worldwide. The appeal reflects a tense geopolitical situation.</p>

The Financial Times describes the US action as a "gamble," while the Metro uses the headline "Hammered" to depict the attack. The Sun's headline, "Stick it up your bunker," references the Falklands War, and the Guardian calls the attack "the most consequential intervention in a conflict in a generation." Many papers highlight Iran's vow to retaliate and the potential for a wider conflict, while others focus on the impact on oil supplies and the increased terror threat in the UK.

Despite Marine Corps recruiters promoting enlistment as protection for families, strict immigrant enforcement directives have reduced deference to military families. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that Paola is in the country illegally, while her husband argues she deserves to live legally in the U.S. The event has resulted in low optimism.</p>

          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and prevents candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field. While the computerized process is quick, the tabulation won't start until July 1 due to mail-in ballots, with official results expected on July 15. The new system is intended to be a more fair and accurate form of voting.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the universe's depths. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, aims to transform our understanding of the cosmos. It is expected to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer questions about dark matter. The observatory will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years, capturing detailed snapshots and increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold.

          <p>President Trump asserted that "obliteration" is an accurate description of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent U.S. strikes. This statement contrasts with more cautious assessments from military officials, who cited "severe damage and destruction" but stopped short of claiming complete obliteration. The UN nuclear watchdog chief also stated that it was too early to assess the full extent of the damage. The strikes targeted facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the mission code-named Operation Midnight Hammer involving over 125 aircraft. The damage inflicted by the strikes leaves the overall tone relatively low.</p>
