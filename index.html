          <p>Following a devastating plane crash in India involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, investigators are examining the aircraft's black boxes to determine the cause of the disaster that killed 270 people. The black boxes, containing cockpit conversations and flight data, are crucial for understanding the sequence of events leading to the crash. Experts from India, the U.K., the U.S., and Boeing are assisting in the investigation, which will also include analyzing CCTV footage, witness statements, pilot training records, and aircraft maintenance history. A high-level committee has been formed to examine the causes and formulate preventative measures, with a preliminary report expected within three months. </p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing pressing matters beyond ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Iran, after urging people to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel and condemning Iran as a source of regional instability, reiterating that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons. Trump dismissed French President Macron's comments about a ceasefire offer, stating his return to Washington was for reasons "much bigger than that." The conflict escalated as Israel claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, while China condemned Israel's actions and offered to mediate. </p>

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported that a U.S. citizen was among those killed by shrapnel, with thirty apartments destroyed in one residential block.

          <p>President Trump signed an order to implement parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, lower than the previously imposed 25% import tax. While the agreement includes aerospace products, it did not address the removal of charges on steel imports, which the UK government hopes to achieve. The UK government will continue to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as previously agreed, as the current US tax on UK imports of steel and aluminium is 25%.</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed at least 15 people, including an American citizen, and injured dozens more. The attack, which lasted nearly nine hours, struck residential buildings, destroying apartments and leaving people trapped under rubble. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as terrorism and called for a stronger international response. The assault occurred as world leaders gathered at the G7 meeting in Canada, where Zelenskyy was expected to meet with President Trump, though Trump left the summit early.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is showcasing contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The festival includes performances such as the "Queer Passion," which highlights the suffering of LGBTQ individuals, and the "Arabian Passion," which promotes peace in the Middle East. These reinterpretations of Bach's work seek to connect classical music with current social and political issues. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive with the addition of the Kulukundis Collection, containing writings and autographs of Bach's sons.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress to develop a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system modeled after Israel's Iron Dome. The proposed system aims to protect the entire United States from missile attacks. However, experts argue that building such a system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the different types of missiles it would need to intercept. The article explores the challenges and feasibility of creating a comprehensive missile defense shield for the United States.</p>

Despite facing an oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing slow but steady improvements in its political, economic, and social conditions. The author contends that Israel's actions undermine the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people, who were pushing their leaders towards reform and de-escalation. The attacks have disrupted negotiations between Iran and the US and destabilized the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump faces multiple options in responding to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, ranging from escalating involvement to pulling back. He could bow to pressure from Netanyahu and escalate military action, maintain a middle ground by reiterating non-involvement, or heed MAGA voices and withdraw support. Each option carries significant risks and implications for Trump's domestic support and foreign policy legacy. The situation is further complicated by the abandonment of planned talks between the US and Iran, leaving the path forward uncertain.</p>

          <p>G7 leaders have called for a "de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza," but stopped short of demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

Trump's departure and mixed messages regarding a potential ceasefire have added uncertainty to the situation.
