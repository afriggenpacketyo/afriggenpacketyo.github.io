          <p>A new food aid system for Gaza, conceived by Israeli officials to undermine Hamas and bypass the United Nations, is set to be implemented by foreign contractors. The plan, initially proposed in late 2023, involves private organizations distributing aid in Israeli-controlled zones. While supporters tout it as a neutral initiative, critics warn it could restrict aid and displace civilians. The project's genesis lies in the aftermath of the October 2023 attack, with Israeli reservists forming a network to develop a strategy for Gaza's future, ultimately outsourcing aid delivery to private companies. This article provides an overview of the situation surrounding aid delivery in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark expressed her frustration with WNBA referees after a controversial no-call in the final seconds of the Indiana Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty. Clark believed she was fouled by Natasha Cloud while attempting a potential game-tying or winning shot. The referees did not blow the whistle, and the game ended there. Cloud has previously defended physical plays against Clark, dismissing criticism as rooted in racism, arguing that Clark is being played like any other top player in the league.

          <p>French authorities suspect arson may have caused a major power outage in southeast France, threatening the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations. Power was restored hours before the Palme d’Or ceremony, but investigations are ongoing into a fire at an electrical substation and a collapsed high-voltage line. About 160,000 households lost electricity, and traffic and train services were disrupted. Despite the outage, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events would proceed as planned, using an independent power supply.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's film, “Un Simple Accident,” won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival, capping what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years. Panahi, a longtime festival favorite, had until recently been barred from making movies in Iran or traveling outside the country, and shot “Un Simple Accident” clandestinely. The movie tracks a group of men and women who join together after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison. The Palme d’Or was decided upon by a nine-person jury led by the French actress Juliette Binoche.</p>

          <p>Limited humanitarian aid is trickling into Gaza after a prolonged blockade, but aid agencies warn it's insufficient to prevent famine. Despite Israel allowing some trucks through the Kerem Shalom crossing, the UN and other organizations cite ongoing delays due to security clearance issues, logistical problems, and infrastructure damage. While the WFP has tons of food assistance ready, movement to distribution points is slow and obstructed by bombs and looting. The situation is dire, with the majority of Gaza's population facing crisis-level food insecurity and a high risk of famine in the coming weeks.</p>
