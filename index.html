          <p>A significant explosion rocked the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, southern Iran, resulting in at least five fatalities and over 700 injuries. While the exact cause remains unclear, authorities suggest it originated from a fire involving chemical containers, dismissing sabotage or deliberate attack. The incident caused widespread concern, with black smoke billowing from the site and an investigation launched by the Iranian government to assess the full extent of the damage and prevent future occurrences. The Iranian president has expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance clarifying the interpretation of the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' in the 2010 Equality Act as biological sex. The guidance states that trans women (biological men) can be excluded from women-only spaces like hospitals and schools, while emphasizing that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. It suggests providing mixed-sex facilities where possible and states that single-sex associations can exclude trans individuals. A two-week consultation will follow, aiming for an updated code of practice by the end of June, while the government plans to review policies to ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>Despite the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russia for war crimes in Ukraine, significant hurdles remain before trials can commence. Key challenges include the immunity granted to acting heads of state, preventing the immediate prosecution of Vladimir Putin, and disagreements over the period the tribunal will consider, with Ukraine pushing for investigations dating back to 2014. The tribunal, operating under the Council of Europe, faces potential political and financial challenges, particularly with uncertain support from the United States and some European nations, raising concerns about its long-term viability and effectiveness in holding Russian leaders accountable.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in American confidence in President Donald Trump, even among Republicans, regarding key issues such as the economy and immigration policy. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term so far as "scary," and only a quarter believe he is focusing on the right priorities. Approval ratings for Trump's handling of the economy and foreign policy are underwhelming, with independent voters expressing significant disapproval. These findings suggest growing public fatigue and concern over the president's performance as he approaches 100 days in office.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting coach who has studied over 200 children, the phrase "You're okay" is the most dangerous and overused phrase in parenting. It teaches kids to doubt their own emotions, invalidates their experience, and short-circuits emotional processing. It also teaches that love is conditional and can rewire a child’s stress response. Instead, parents should validate their children's feelings and provide support.</p>
