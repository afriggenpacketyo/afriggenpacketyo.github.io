          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended due to pantograph problems detected the previous night. The suspension of both inner and outer loops of the JR Yamanote Line, which circles central Tokyo, caused significant disruption for commuters. Operations were halted to inspect equipment related to power supply to carriages. Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also resumed with delays, while the Keiyo Line experienced temporary suspension due to smoke on the tracks at Hatchobori Station. The cause of the abnormality was traced to a power line-related facility near Shimbashi Station.</p>

          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has identified multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, among international travelers at airports in California, Washington, Virginia, and the New York City area. The variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage, is dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. While Hong Kong authorities see no evidence of increased severity, they urge masking in public transportation. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially increasing transmissibility. The FDA's vaccine advisors are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines to target JN.1 variants, which may offer better protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>

          <p>Judge Jeffrey White of the Northern District of California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to detain and deport international students whose visas were revoked without clear justification. The temporary injunction protects students participating in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, preventing their arrest or visa revocation while the case proceeds. Judge White expressed suspicion that the Trump administration was trying to place future visa terminations beyond judicial review, criticizing the government's abrupt changes in course during litigation. The order comes hours after the Trump administration halted Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students, and this nationwide order could at least in part prevent the Trump administration’s move from being enforced.</p>

          <p>A Cessna 550 plane crashed into a military housing neighborhood in San Diego, resulting in at least six fatalities and displacing approximately 100 people. The crash occurred near Sculpin Street and Santo Road, close to the 15 Freeway, in a Navy-owned housing area. Among the deceased was Dave Shapiro, co-founder of the music agency Sound Talent Group, and Daniel Williams, former drummer for the band The Devil Wears Prada. The plane struck power lines before colliding with a house, igniting fires on parked cars and damaging about 10 buildings. The flight originated from Teterboro, New Jersey, with a stop in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with President Donald Trump in a dispute over his authority to remove appointees from federal boards. The court upheld Trump’s removal of two Democratic appointees, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) respectively. The ruling addresses whether board members appointed by President Joe Biden can remain in their positions while a larger legal battle continues over the president's power to fire agency officials. Justice Elena Kagan, along with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, dissented, suggesting the ruling telegraphs a future decision that would grant the President significant control over the Executive Branch.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that prosecutors can proceed with murder charges against two men accused of killing Sidney Barrett Morris, a California State University, Northridge official, despite the absence of a known motive. Morris was shot in the back of the head at L.A. Live in 2023. Prosecutors allege that Phillip Clark was the shooter and Santana Kelly orchestrated the killing, based on surveillance videos, phone records, and jail calls. Lawyers for the defendants argued that prosecutors had not established a clear connection between their clients and the victim. The killing occurred when a white Ford Escape stopped near Fixins Soul Kitchen, and the shooter was wearing distinctive clothing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a cornerstone immigration policy that ensures basic rights and protections for child immigrants in government custody. These protections limit detention time and require adequate food, water, and clean clothes for children. The Justice Department argues the agreement incentivizes unauthorized border crossings and hinders effective detention and removal of families. Critics argue this move disregards the rule of law and the well-being of vulnerable children. The administration's effort to suspend the Flores agreement has been struck down previously, and it has faced lawsuits for mistreating immigrant children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest in over two years, driven partly by rising rice prices, as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) considers pausing rate hikes to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, exceeding the BOJ's 2% target for over three years. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates but also emphasized monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Economists anticipate core inflation will ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation. Oversupply of food from U.S. tariffs could also decrease food prices, while government subsidies for electricity and gas bills may further reduce inflation.</p>

Some attendees hope to influence crypto regulations, while others are shrouded in mystery. The value of the coin has fluctuated wildly, and many investors have incurred losses.

Ranchers say they are left with no choice but to increase prices to stay profitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its initial report identifying poor diet, chemical exposure, inactivity, and overmedicalization as leading drivers of childhood chronic disease. The report, a product of collaborative effort, emphasizes rising rates of obesity, diabetes, autism, ADHD, cancer, allergies, and autoimmune disorders in children. While some medical experts attribute the autism increase to better testing, others criticize the report for misrepresenting facts and omitting key factors. The report reflects Kennedy's long-standing concerns, including criticisms of ultra-processed foods and the vaccine schedule, while also pointing to international examples of better practices.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily upheld President Donald Trump's decision to fire two agency officials with fixed terms, setting aside rulings that would have reinstated them. The decision, made by a 6-3 vote, sided with the president's power to fire agency officials, but the justices clarified that the Federal Reserve Board is not affected by this decision. The court acknowledged a dispute over whether the Constitution grants the president or Congress the power to set the structure of the federal government. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, emphasizing the importance of respecting congressional will and established precedent regarding independent agencies.</p>

          <p>The skincare industry's marketing of products with anti-aging ingredients to tweens is raising concerns about potential harm to young skin. Social media influencers, often in partnership with brands, promote skincare routines that include products with retinol and vitamin C, which dermatologists advise against for young children. Data shows significant spending on skincare and makeup by households with children 12 and under. Dermatologists warn that these products can cause painful rashes and increase sunburn risk. Lawmakers are considering legislation to restrict the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to children, but concerns remain about marketing tactics and lack of clear labeling.</p>

The Trump administration argues his presence hinders efforts to prevent antisemitism, while Khalil's lawyers claim his detention is retaliation for pro-Palestinian speech.

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, known as the "Bagel Lady," passed away at 87. She was a painter who unexpectedly started creating art from bagels, leading to a career as a children's book author and toy designer. In the 1970s, she began making bagel necklaces and other crafts, which became popular and sold in stores like Bloomingdale's. This success led to her writing "The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane" and designing toys like Sweetie Pops and Baby Check-Up. Blau's unique artistic journey began with a dare from her husband and transformed her life.</p>

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that limits federal judges' power to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision, included in the tax and spending cut bill, aims to curb the power of federal courts to issue injunctions blocking Trump's executive actions. Democrats argue the bill undermines the judiciary's power by removing consequences for officials who ignore rulings. The provision would apply retroactively, affecting ongoing cases where Trump administration officials are being considered for contempt over deporting immigrants.</p>

The FBI and local police are investigating the shooting as a hate crime and an act of terrorism.
