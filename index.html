          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is campaigning for CPR to be taught in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions within three years. The teenager believes he might have been able to help save his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest, if he had been trained in the life-saving skill. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already succeeded in introducing training at his own school and has garnered the attention of Scotland's Education Secretary. He shared his moving story with Members of the Scottish Parliament to emphasize the urgency of equipping young people with confidence to act in an emergency.</p>

The uncertainty stems from President Trump's threat to impose new tariffs in response to China's export controls on critical rare earth minerals. While Trump later suggested a resolution was possible, the renewed tensions have created market apprehension. Investors are also awaiting the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report for further guidance on the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of fatalities from severe flooding and torrential rains across five states in Mexico has risen to 64, with an additional 65 people reported missing. The government has deployed approximately 10,000 troops to assist in rescue and relief efforts, as around 100,000 homes have been damaged. In the oil town of Poza Rica, cleanup is complicated by thick oil residue that mixed with floodwaters, coating homes and streets. President Claudia Sheinbaum assured that sufficient resources are being allocated for the emergency, though some communities remain cut off.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has intensified his call for the implementation of a targeted national screening program for prostate cancer. Speaking as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argued that such a program is now affordable, deliverable, and would "save countless lives." The proposal focuses on higher-risk groups, including men with a family history of the disease and Black men. The call comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the risks of over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Peking University have successfully restored a complete version of the ancient Chinese calligraphy masterpiece, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The original work, created by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, had only survived in fragments, with just 250 of its 919 characters known. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving text, the team employed artificial intelligence to replicate the artist's unique style and generate the missing characters. This project showcases the potential of AI to preserve and reconstruct invaluable cultural heritage, bridging ancient art with modern digital technology.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker Wingtech dropped significantly after the Dutch government took control of its subsidiary Nexperia to ensure the availability of essential semiconductor products. Simultaneously, broader Asian markets saw mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi reaching an all-time high while Japan's Nikkei declined. Tensions were further stoked as China sanctioned five U.S.-related units of South Korean shipping company Hanwha Ocean in retaliation for a U.S. investigation into its maritime industries, causing Hanwha's shares to fall sharply.

          <p>A new campaign in the UK will encourage people applying for a driving licence to also register as blood donors. The initiative, a partnership between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant, aims to boost donor numbers, particularly among young people. Officials hope to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the driving licence application since 1994. With over half of regular blood donors being over 45, the NHS faces a critical need for new, younger donors to maintain a safe and reliable supply for hospitals.</p>

The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softer performance in construction. In conjunction with the data release, the country's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, maintained its current policy settings. However, it issued a warning that GDP growth is likely to moderate to a near-trend pace in 2026 as global economic activity normalizes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed legislation that would have banned perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as "forever chemicals," from a variety of consumer products. The bill aimed to phase out PFAS in items like nonstick cookware, children's products, and food packaging by 2030 due to their links to adverse health effects, including cancer. In his veto statement, Newsom expressed concern about the impact on the availability of affordable cooking products, despite acknowledging the bill's well-intentioned goal of protecting consumer health. The bill's author stated he would continue to work on the issue.</p>

          <p>Newly released police records reveal that the gunman who attacked a Dallas immigration facility had developed paranoid beliefs, including that he had "radiation sickness" and was "allergic to plastic." His parents told police he was normal before returning from a job in Washington state, after which he became a loner obsessed with AI. The 29-year-old killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life in the September attack. While his motives remain unclear, he had written "ANTI-ICE" on a bullet and left notes indicating a desire to terrorize federal agents.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office has reaffirmed its 2011 finding that the death of schoolteacher Ellen Greenberg was a suicide, despite recent challenges. Greenberg was found with approximately 20 stab wounds, leading her family to believe she was murdered and prompting a years-long campaign for re-investigation. Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lindsay Simon concluded in a new 32-page report that Greenberg was capable of inflicting the injuries herself, citing her anxiety at the time. An attorney for the Greenberg family heavily criticized the report as a "deeply flawed" attempt to justify a predetermined conclusion.</p>

          <p>China has commenced mass production of a highly sensitive, four-channel single-photon detector, a critical component for next-generation quantum radar systems. This technology, capable of detecting the smallest unit of energy, is expected to significantly enhance China's ability to track stealth aircraft like the F-22. Described as a "photon catcher," the device's development by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui marks a major advancement. The technology has broad applications, ranging from national defense to secure quantum communications, positioning China at the forefront of this field.</p>

In contrast, the U.S. Air Force is actively seeking to purchase two Cybertrucks specifically for use as targets in live missile fire testing.

Dutch authorities had reported the submarine was under tow, though Russia's Black Sea Fleet denied any malfunction, stating it surfaced to comply with navigation rules in the English Channel.

This successful flight is a critical step for both Elon Musk's goal of reaching Mars and NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship to land astronauts on the moon.

Proponents argued the legislation was distinct from banned affirmative action policies because it was not based on race. However, the measure was expected to face legal challenges, as critics contended it used lineage as a proxy for race.</p>
