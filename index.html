          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that international law is central to the Starmer government's foreign policy, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a warm relationship with the United States, even at the expense of short-term political gains. He highlighted that adhering to international law is essential for securing trade deals and addressing fundamental problems like migration. Hermer defended Starmer's approach, noting the UK's recent trade agreements with the US, India, and the EU, which he attributes to the country's reputation as a trustworthy partner. He also addressed past controversies, including remarks comparing calls to depart from international law to arguments made in 1930s Germany, while reaffirming the government's commitment to legal compliance both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures across the eastern United States, with more than 150 million Americans under extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous conditions from the Midwest to the East Coast, citing light winds and a lack of overnight cooling as major concerns. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, an area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity. Experts advise staying indoors with air conditioning, avoiding strenuous outdoor activities, and staying hydrated to prevent heat-related illnesses, as climate change makes such extreme events more frequent and longer-lasting.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in rare earth elements is significantly bolstered by supplies from Myanmar, which accounts for a substantial portion of China's rare earth imports. Myanmar is a key source of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-tech manufacturing. China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, raising concerns about environmental and human rights abuses. This dynamic has given China a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain, increasing its leverage in the global market.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak" and causing little damage. He thanked Iran for the warning, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. Trump also announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a cease-fire, urging both nations to pursue peace and harmony. The move to give advance notice is similar to Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where no American service members were killed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland. The court reversed a lower court order requiring the government to give migrants a chance to argue they could be tortured or killed if deported to a third country. The ruling allows the administration to deport migrants to countries like South Sudan, even if they face significant risks. The decision has been criticized by liberal justices as rewarding lawlessness and exposing migrants to danger.</p>
