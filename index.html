          <p>China has stated that it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations, which could lead to discussions aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war. U.S. officials have reportedly reached out multiple times, expressing a desire to start negotiations on tariffs. China insists that the U.S. must remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity and build mutual trust, with failure to do so potentially undermining any negotiations. Analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal would be complex and time-consuming due to Trump's unpredictability and strategic priorities on both sides.</p>

          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits that surpassed expectations, driven by significant growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, up from $1.91 billion in the same period last year, with earnings per share up 19%. CEO Bill Winters noted that the earnings do not fully reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs, and while trade tariffs have increased global economic complexity, the bank remains confident in improving returns. Standard Chartered is also implementing a cost-saving initiative aimed at saving $1.5 billion over three years.</p>

          <p>The Runcorn and Helsby by-election is undergoing a recount due to an extremely close margin, with only four votes separating Reform UK and Labour. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of the former Labour MP, Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Early results showed Labour holding the North Tyneside and Doncaster mayoralties, but with significantly reduced vote shares as Reform came in a close second. Reform is also targeting councils such as Kent and Lincolnshire, and believes it could make gains in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has closed the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to U.S. customers without duties or taxes. This change will likely increase prices for consumers buying from online retailers like Shein and Temu, who heavily relied on this exemption. The move aims to address concerns about illegal goods and protect American businesses, with taxes of up to 120% being applied to affected packages. The closure is expected to strain border authorities and potentially add billions in costs for consumers.</p>

The White House claims that NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars.

          <p>Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident where a fan fell over 20 feet at PNC Park during a Pirates-Cubs game as accidental. The fan, identified as Kavan Markwood, remains in critical condition at the hospital. The incident occurred after an RBI double by Andrew McCutchen, with Markwood falling from the right-field bleachers onto the warning track. The game was delayed for about 10 minutes, and the Pirates organization released a statement expressing their thoughts and prayers for Markwood and his family.</p>

          <p>Detailed plans have emerged for a large military parade on Donald Trump's birthday, involving thousands of soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft. The event is expected to feature army bands, parachute jumps, historical vehicles, a concert, and fireworks.
