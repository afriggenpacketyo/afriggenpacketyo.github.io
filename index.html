          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has assigned a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) Level 1 to the upcoming funeral for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, providing security on par with the Super Bowl. This designation enables a comprehensive federal response to support local law enforcement in managing the event, which is expected to draw over 100,000 attendees. President Trump and other high-profile officials are anticipated to be present, necessitating extensive protective measures including a significant police presence, drones, and helicopters.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging monopolistic and illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies colluded with scalpers, used "bait and switch" pricing, and violated the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, costing consumers millions. The FTC alleges Ticketmaster "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. The agency is seeking an injunction to halt these practices which they claim harm both fans and artists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the UK, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to manage the country's borders, warning that illegal migration could "destroy countries from within." The comment came during a press conference where both leaders navigated several policy differences, including the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. Despite some disagreements, the visit was framed as a success, securing a reported £150bn in US investment and a new technology pact. Starmer's government recently began its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, has warned that President Trump's tariffs are devastating Asian-American-owned businesses. They argue that these small "mom and pop" enterprises are facing skyrocketing import costs, forcing them to either raise prices on consumers or risk permanent closure. Congresswoman Judy Chu cited an example of a constituent whose medicinal oil import costs for a single shipment jumped from $500 to $13,000. The lawmakers are urging the administration to reverse the duties, which they describe as a "cruel betrayal."</p>

          <p>Arie Perliger, a UMass Lowell professor specializing in political violence, suggests that the public obsession with the political affiliation of Charlie Kirk's killer misses the larger issue. He argues that intense political polarization and a dysfunctional political system create an environment that normalizes violence as a means to achieve political goals. Perliger's research indicates that assassins are often motivated by a loss of faith in the political process, viewing violence as a shortcut to change. He contends that instead of assigning blame to one side, the focus should be on the broader societal conditions that facilitate such tragic acts.</p>

This rush for facilities comes just months after a White House advisory group, DOGE, terminated numerous government leases and cut GSA staff.

          <h2>Legal Experts Warn of Dangerous Precedent in Government Response to Charlie Kirk's Critics</h2>

          <p>The government's crackdown on critics following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is setting a dangerous precedent for free speech, according to legal experts. Actions such as the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after pressure from the FCC, and calls by the Attorney General to prosecute "hate speech," are seen as an overreach of government power. Scholars argue that while much of the speech is offensive, it is largely protected by the First Amendment, with narrow exceptions for direct threats or incitement. The experts express concern that these actions could lead to the unconstitutional suppression of lawful expression and political dissent.</p>

          <h2>Bad Bunny Skips US Tour Dates, Citing Fears of ICE Targeting Fans at Concerts</h2>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny has stated he will not perform in the 50 U.S. states during his current world tour due to fears that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could target his fans. As a U.S. citizen from Puerto Rico, the artist himself is not at risk, but he expressed concern for his largely Latino fanbase. In response, a Department of Homeland Security official dismissed his fears as "misinformed" or an excuse for poor ticket sales. The situation highlights a broader climate of uncertainty for performers, with foreign artists also facing new logistical and financial hurdles in securing U.S. work visas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A jury has acquitted Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester charged with assaulting a U.S. border patrol agent during an immigration demonstration in Los Angeles. The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior official. Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito but did not show the alleged assault by the protester. The case was one of many aggressive prosecutions of protesters involved in demonstrations against the administration's immigration raids this summer.</p>

          <p>Ted Leonsis, founder of Monumental Sports & Entertainment (MSE), remains focused on acquiring Washington, D.C.'s baseball and soccer teams to add to his sports empire. Leonsis, who already owns the Capitals, Wizards, and Mystics, believes plugging more teams into his company's centralized platform for sales and media would make them more competitive. Despite previous unsuccessful bids for the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, he continues to pursue opportunities to expand his D.C.-focused conglomerate.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased. A $50,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now has an average rate of 8.43%, resulting in a monthly payment of about $618, a minor reduction from earlier in the year. With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, these loans offer a lower-interest alternative to personal loans or credit cards for borrowing significant sums. While the savings are not dramatic, they can accumulate over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Historical Tension in American Higher Education's Purpose Remains Unresolved</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 15:18:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American higher education has long been torn between three competing functions: providing cultural formation, preparing students for careers, and advancing academic research. This tension dates back to the late 19th century, when figures like Harvard's Charles W. Eliot pushed to make college more practical, moving away from the purely classical curriculum. The subsequent rise of the research university, exemplified by Johns Hopkins, further shifted the focus toward faculty scholarship. This article argues that the debate over what college is for has never been settled, and its contradictions are felt today as students question the value of their degrees.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump suggested a potential breakthrough in the Russia-Ukraine war could be imminent. Trump stated he hopes to "have some good news" soon, citing his obligation to settle the conflict that has claimed millions of lives. However, he also expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, "He's let me down." The comments came at the conclusion of a successful state visit to the UK, where Trump admitted resolving the long-running war has been more difficult than he anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first migrant has been deported from the UK to France under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme aimed at deterring small boat crossings of the English Channel. An Indian national was removed on a flight to Paris on Thursday morning, with more flights planned in the coming days. The agreement involves the UK accepting a person through a legal route for every migrant returned to France. The move comes amid legal challenges, with the High Court rejecting a last-minute attempt to block the removal of an Eritrean man scheduled for Friday.</p>
