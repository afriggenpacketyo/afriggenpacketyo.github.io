        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration, siding with Venezuelan nationals who sought to block their removal from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. The court determined that the detainees were not given sufficient time or resources to challenge their deportations, emphasizing the importance of due process. While the ruling acknowledges national security interests, it insists on constitutional consistency in pursuing those interests. The case now returns to a lower court to determine the appropriate level of notice required for those targeted for removal, offering only temporary relief while the case returns to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to sort out the question of how much notice is due to those being targeted for removal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Georgia, a brain-dead pregnant woman is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a situation her family says is mandated by the state's abortion law. The hospital's decision stems from Georgia's "heartbeat law," which restricts abortions after cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks into pregnancy. The family is upset that they cannot make decisions about her medical care, as removing life support would likely result in the death of the fetus. Bioethicists debate the legality of this interpretation, especially in light of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which previously protected abortion rights.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over increasing government debt and interest payment ratios. The agency noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. Moody's expects federal deficits to increase from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% by 2035, driven by rising interest payments and entitlement spending. Despite the downgrade, the outlook was changed from negative to stable, acknowledging the U.S. economy's strengths and the dollar's role as a global reserve currency.</p>

Colbert is accused of drugging and robbing Manzano, fitting a pattern of similar incidents reported by other men in New Orleans.

Proposed legislation could penalize states that use their own funds for immigrant healthcare, potentially costing them billions. While some Democratic governors have already begun scaling back immigrant benefits due to budget constraints, this federal intervention is creating a political divide within the party. Some argue that Democrats should fight for immigrant communities rather than retrench in the face of federal pressure.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors announced charges against three reputed MS-13 members for allegedly killing Herlyn Barrientos, a fellow gang member who became an FBI informant. Barrientos, who was cooperating with the FBI on drug trafficking charges, was allegedly killed on the orders of gang leaders after his status as an informant became widely known. The FBI agent was on the phone with Barrientos when the shooting occurred, and evidence suggests he was killed because of his cooperation with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A fire devastated the historic Nottoway Plantation House in Louisiana, a significant antebellum mansion. The fire, which required nearly a dozen fire departments to battle, caused a "total loss" of the structure, which had been used as a museum and event venue. The mansion's owner expressed heartbreak over the loss, while officials noted the site's complex history, including its ties to slavery and its later evolution into a place of reflection and education.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports found that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged due to price tag errors, including expired discounts. The investigation, prompted by employee allegations, revealed over 150 instances of overcharging, averaging $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, claiming they represent a small fraction of transactions, consumer advocates emphasize the importance of accurate pricing. Similar issues have been reported at other retailers, but the Kroger case is notable due to its prevalence in areas with limited grocery options and a history of customer complaints.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the United States, citing rising debt levels and political gridlock. The downgrade, to one notch below the highest triple-A rating, reflects concerns about the government's failure to address long-term financial challenges, including Social Security and Medicare underfunding. Moody's also pointed to the potential for a $4 trillion increase in the deficit if tax cuts are extended. Despite the downgrade, investors are expected to continue purchasing U.S. debt, reflecting the dollar's status as the global reserve currency.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Andry HernÃ¡ndez, was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador based on a gang 'points system' that flagged him as a suspected member of the Tren de Aragua gang due to tattoos, including crowns, on his wrists. HernÃ¡ndez, who was seeking asylum, was transferred to a mega-prison in El Salvador without being able to contest the charges. His lawyers argue that the tattoo identification is insufficient and that he has no criminal record, while his community in Venezuela vouches for his character.</p>
