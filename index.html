          <h2>Russian Soldiers Express Skepticism About Peace Talks and Demand Territorial Gains in Ukraine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 06:20:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article provides a rare glimpse into the morale and opinions of Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, revealing deep skepticism about diplomatic efforts and a strong desire to conquer all four southern and eastern Ukrainian regions claimed by the Kremlin. Many soldiers express exhaustion with the war but insist that sacrifices must be justified by a victorious outcome, reflecting the impact of years of war propaganda and battlefield gains. The interviews also highlight resentment among soldiers toward officials and civilians perceived as benefiting from the war while ignoring frontline hardships. These sentiments suggest that President Putin could face domestic challenges in ending the war on terms that fall short of his maximalist goals, and that integrating servicemen back into civilian life after any peace deal will be difficult.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article reports that despite President Trump's decision to bypass Israel during his Middle East tour, experts believe his visit advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests. Trump emphasized key points reflecting Israeli priorities, such as condemning Hamas, calling for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran. While some Israeli commentators expressed discomfort at being excluded from the tour, others emphasized that Trump's "America First" approach ultimately supports Israel. Experts also highlighted the opportunity for Israel to leverage developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Syria to advance its interests, particularly regarding normalization with Saudi Arabia and ensuring Syria follows a non-jihadist path.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian reports that Congressional Republicans are proposing new fees on immigrants seeking to remain in the United States, a move that advocates warn will create insurmountable financial barriers. The legislation could require immigrants to pay fees to seek asylum, care for a minor in government custody, or apply for humanitarian parole. Republicans describe the fees as necessary to offset the costs of Trump's immigration crackdown, while experts argue they could drain immigrants' resources and force them into exploitative work arrangements. The bill is a top priority for Republicans, but its pathway to enactment is unclear.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian discusses how US cancer researchers are looking to fecal waste for treatment clues, with the Mayo Clinic biobank at the forefront of this effort. The biobank is part of a years-long effort to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome changes how patients respond to cancer medications. Researchers are experimenting with colonizing patients' guts with new bacteria through fecal transplants and investigating "crapsules" and "crispr-ing" the gut microbiome. The work comes as scientific institutions are under attack by the Trump administration, which has proposed large cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

Federal judges have ordered the release of several detained students, citing constitutional concerns. However, the fundamental question of whether the government has the authority to deport noncitizens over their political speech remains unsettled. The arrests have prompted anxiety among international students and scholars, contributing to a climate of fear and repression on US campuses, despite the ongoing war in Gaza.</p>

With the Lakers in need of a big man, the columnist suggests they consider a 24-year-old college graduate with a good head on his shoulders, rather than chasing a "high ceiling" prospect.</p>

The escalation of Israeli air attacks came as mediators, including the Trump administration, sought to broker a new truce for Gaza to halt the war.
