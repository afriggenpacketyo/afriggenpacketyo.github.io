Patel stated on social media that his team uncovered thousands of documents, including a classified annex from the Durham report, in a previously hidden room at FBI headquarters. He asserted that this discovery exposes the truth about the probe, similar to his previous work on the Steele Dossier. The declassified annex is being coordinated with other intelligence agencies and will be transmitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee for public release.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on why the Nanking massacre remains a deeply powerful and painful symbol in modern China, particularly as new films about the event educate younger generations. The author describes it as more than just a historical tragedy; it is a profound moral wound on the national psyche, shaping both Chinese identity and foreign policy. The piece suggests this legacy of trauma is intensified by a perception that the Japanese government has never fully acknowledged or atoned for the wartime atrocities. This unresolved history continues to fuel a collective memory of shock and grief.</p>

Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian, advocated tirelessly for her release, which came after intervention from Senator John Kennedy's office. While she is now home with her family under parole conditions, she still faces a lengthy immigration process to secure a green card.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former judge and prominent Fox News personality, to the powerful post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. Pirro, a staunch ally of President Trump, had been serving in an acting capacity since May and will now officially lead the office responsible for prosecuting both federal and local crimes in the nation's capital. Her nomination followed the collapse of a previous nominee and faced little pushback from Democrats. The confirmation is part of a series of appointments President Trump is pushing through before the Senate adjourns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has opened an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led investigations into President Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of federal employees. The probe was initiated following a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's push for a "rushed trial" of Trump before the election constituted illegal political activity. Smith, who resigned in January, had brought criminal charges against Trump in two separate cases that were later closed after the election.</p>

          <p>Researchers have uncovered the likely cause of death for 'Winston,' a platypus gifted to Prime Minister Winston Churchill by Australia in 1943. For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, archival research of the attendant's logbook reveals a more mundane cause: the platypus likely succumbed to prolonged high temperatures and insufficient food as the ship crossed the equator. The failure of this early attempt at "platypus diplomacy" was kept secret for years to avoid a potential diplomatic incident during World War Two.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to boost its economy and fuel consumer spending. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, adding to the more than 4,400 attractions already operating nationwide. According to the global theme park industry association, IAAPA, the number of such facilities is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. The strategy is based on the principle that these attractions act as powerful economic drivers for their local regions.</p>

Mason traces the evolution of tactics and rhetoric from protests at abortion clinics to the storming of the U.S. Capitol. The discussion explores how this opposition to abortion became a foundational element for a wider anti-government and extremist movement in the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to introduce a new criminal offense aimed at cracking down on the online promotion of illegal immigration. The proposed law would target individuals who use social media and other platforms to advertise services that facilitate illegal Channel crossings, such as selling fake documents or promising illegal work. Those convicted could face up to five years in prison. This measure is part of a broader government strategy to disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, as official analysis shows around 80% of migrants use social media during their journey.</p>

          <p>The global TikTok craze for Labubu dolls is being exploited by criminals who are flooding the market with dangerous counterfeit versions. Trading Standards officers have seized thousands of fake dolls that pose serious safety risks, including parts that easily detach and become choking hazards for children. Authorities warn these counterfeits are often made with inferior or toxic materials, unlike the authentic products from parent company Pop Mart. The high demand and scalpers buying genuine dolls in bulk have created a fertile market for these potentially harmful fakes.</p>

He was particularly critical of two unnamed players who he felt wanted to do their own thing on the pitch.
