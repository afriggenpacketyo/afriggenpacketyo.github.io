          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a motion to unseal exhibits and testimony from the federal grand juries that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Officials noted that while much of the testimony is public, the exhibits contain names not previously revealed, and they are now attempting to notify these individuals. This move follows criticism from victims' attorneys who argue the Trump administration has not been transparent, reinforcing a perception that victims are an afterthought. The government has requested until August 14 to complete the notifications before the materials are released.</p>

          <p>For a second time, Texas House Democrats prevented a legislative session by not showing up, denying Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a controversial redistricting plan. The proposed maps would likely secure Republican control of the U.S. House. Despite threats of arrest and loss of pay from Governor Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders, the Democrats have fled the state and plan to remain absent until the special session ends. This political standoff highlights the intense national battle over redistricting and its implications for future elections.</p>

With four locations in New Jersey, guests can either make a suggested donation or volunteer their time in roles like serving or dishwashing to cover their meal. The model is designed for empowerment rather than charity, also providing community outreach to help patrons with housing and healthcare. The restaurant has earned high praise for its food quality, ranking in the top 1% of businesses on TripAdvisor.</p>

          <p>While global attention on falling birth rates often centers on East Asia, Latin American nations like Chile are also experiencing significant declines in fertility. This article explores the trend by investigating the personal decisions and societal factors contributing to Chile's plummeting birth rate. The report from Chile's capital aims to provide a deeper understanding of this demographic shift, which has wide-ranging implications for the country's future economy and social structure. It highlights a complex issue that extends beyond commonly discussed regions.</p>

          <p>Newly unsealed evidence in the case of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman convicted of murdering her in-laws with a mushroom-laced meal, reveals allegations she also tried to poison her estranged husband on multiple occasions. Her husband, Simon, testified that he suffered several near-death experiences from food she prepared, leading him to decline the fatal lunch invitation out of fear. Although prosecutors dropped these additional attempted murder charges before the trial, the evidence sheds new light on the case. Patterson faces a potential life sentence for the three murders.</p>

          <p>A Republican Texas state representative, Briscoe Cain, has asserted that the Democratic lawmakers who broke quorum did so out of fear of being challenged in primary elections by more progressive candidates. In an interview, Cain described the Democratic party as being run by "crazies" and claimed the absent lawmakers are engaging in a futile political stunt. This perspective frames the Democrats' actions not as a principled stand against gerrymandering, but as a response to internal party pressure, while Republican leaders continue to pursue legal and financial consequences.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly proposed that the University of California system pay a fine exceeding $1 billion to settle federal charges of antisemitism at UCLA. This settlement would be in exchange for the release of $584 million in frozen federal research grants for the university. The proposal follows similar actions against other universities, but California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated his opposition to such a deal, vowing to fight against it.

          <p>Five years after the largest protests in Belarus's history against President Alexander Lukashenko's rigged election, the country has seen little positive change. The regime, with Russia's support, has systematically erased traces of the uprising and intensified its crackdown, with thousands prosecuted for political reasons. While the government has recently released some political prisoners, it appears to be using them as bargaining chips for concessions from the West. Analysts suggest that without significant international leverage, the prospects for democratic change in Belarus remain dim.</p>

          <p>A deadline set by President Donald Trump for Russia to cease its war in Ukraine is set to expire, with the administration threatening steep "secondary tariffs" of around 100% on Russia's trade partners if Moscow does not comply. The ultimatum is part of Trump's key foreign policy goal to end the war, a shift from his earlier, more lenient stance toward the Kremlin. Despite a recent "highly productive" meeting between a U.S. envoy and Vladimir Putin, Trump has expressed disappointment with the lack of progress, leaving markets to watch whether the White House will follow through on its threat.</p>

          <p>As Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" turns 100, this article reflects on its enduring relevance, particularly as a masterpiece of the midlife crisis. The book, which unfolds over a single day, juxtaposes the life of its high-society protagonist with that of a war veteran suffering from what is now known as PTSD. The author notes that while they first read the book in college, its themes of mortality, regret, and the affirmation of life resonate differently and more deeply with age. The article suggests the novel's power lies in its ability to reward rereading at various stages of life.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11th terrorist attacks, New York City's chief medical examiner has identified the remains of three more victims, bringing the total number of identified individuals to 1,653.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for the "immediate" resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to his alleged investment ties to Chinese companies. The demand follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton about national security. In a memo to employees, Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry appointed in March, pushed back against the accusations as "misinformation" and affirmed he has always operated with the highest ethical standards. Intel's shares fell following the president's unusual public attack on a corporate executive.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been convicted of murdering Harvey Willgoose, also 15, by stabbing him in the heart with a hunting knife during a lunch break at a Sheffield school. The attack followed a social media quarrel between the two pupils. The defendant, who cannot be named, had admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped" and had been bullied. Prosecutors argued the act was deliberate, pointing to the defendant's "unhealthy interest in weapons." The victim's family called for continued campaigning against knife crime following the verdict.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Texas Democrats' Quorum Break Is Unlikely to Stop GOP Redistricting</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the Texas Democrats' decision to flee the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, concluding that the move is likely to end with Republicans achieving their goal. While the quorum break successfully draws national attention to gerrymandering and allows Democratic leaders to demonstrate resolve, its practical goal of running out the clock is difficult. The personal and financial strain on lawmakers, combined with mounting pressure from GOP leaders, makes a long-term holdout unsustainable. Past instances suggest that the new, more Republican-favorable maps will inevitably pass.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen plunged over 25% after the company cut its full-year revenue and sales outlook for the second consecutive quarter. The company cited several challenges, including a weak consumer environment, the rocky transition of its loyalty program, and operational issues in its stores. Sweetgreen now projects negative same-store sales for the year, a significant reversal from its original outlook of single-digit growth. The CEO admitted to a "really, really rough quarter," highlighting both external economic pressures and internal execution problems. (not investment advice)</p>
