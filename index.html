          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals after her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, withdrew due to injury just before their scheduled quarter-final match. This walkover sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American fourth seed Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot in the semifinals with a commanding straight-sets victory over Barbora Krejcikova, continuing her impressive run in the tournament without dropping a single set.</p>

          <p>Investors reacted positively to the federal court's remedies in the Google search monopoly case, causing Alphabet's stock to jump 8% in extended trading. The ruling avoided the harshest penalties proposed by the Department of Justice, such as the forced sale of the Chrome browser or its Android operating system. While Google must loosen its grip on search data and is barred from exclusive default search engine contracts, the market perceived the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant, avoiding a disruptive divestiture of key assets.

          <p>In a new court filing, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, has asserted that his client "did not ever commit mortgage fraud." The filing aims to block President Trump's attempt to fire her, arguing that the allegations are a pretext for the president's desire for the Fed to lower interest rates. Lowell contends that the government was aware of the details in her financial documents before her Senate confirmation, suggesting the stated reasons for her removal lack legal merit and are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is planning to send National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime, stating, "We're going in." This potential move follows similar federal interventions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles and has drawn immediate criticism from local leaders. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the president's comments "unhinged" and stated he would not request federal troops, preparing for a potential legal battle over the deployment, which raises questions of federal authority over state-run forces.</p>

          <p>Karen Huger, a star of "The Real Housewives of Potomac," has been released from a Maryland detention center after serving six months of a one-year sentence. Her sentence stemmed from a 2024 conviction for driving under the influence, which occurred after she crashed her Maserati. Huger had previously attributed the incident to grief related to her mother's death and had entered a recovery program to address her use of antidepressants and alcohol prior to her incarceration.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges to address a significant case backlog and a shortage of judges. This move follows recent changes that lowered the qualification requirements, removing the need for prior immigration law experience. The deployment of these lawyers, who will receive about two weeks of training, is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expedite immigration proceedings and increase deportations amid a strained court system.</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, the chief of English football's refereeing body, has publicly acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham in their recent match against Chelsea was a "misjudgement." The goal, scored by Josh King, was overturned after a lengthy VAR review for a minor foul in the build-up, a decision that Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that the intervention did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to overturn an on-field decision, confirming it was an officiating error.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's tariffs illegal has introduced significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raised questions about billions of dollars in collected duties. While the decision is stayed until October 14 pending a likely Supreme Court appeal, logistics professionals report that shippers are currently maintaining a cautious, wait-and-see approach. If the ruling is upheld, the government may be required to issue massive refunds, but the complex process and potential for new tariffs under different authorities leave businesses in limbo.
