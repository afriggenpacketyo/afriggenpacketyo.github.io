          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company's net sales increased by 10.6%, driven by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex and the opening of new restaurants. Same-store sales also rose, with Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse outperforming expectations due to the return of Olive Garden's "Buy One Take One" deal. Darden anticipates revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the full fiscal year, indicating a positive outlook despite concerns about consumer spending. Optimism surrounding the company is furthered by the company's board of directors authorizing a $1 billion share repurchase program. </p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners are exploring options like home equity loans and HELOCs. Currently, rates for both are similar, around 8.25%, but this may change due to the variable nature of HELOC rates. A $200,000 home equity loan is marginally less expensive than a $200,000 HELOC right now, but that dynamic can and almost assuredly will change over a multiple-year repayment period. Borrowers should compare offers carefully, considering potential rate fluctuations and the flexibility of interest-only payments with HELOCs (not investment advice).</p>

The research, conducted by linguists at the University of Queensland, Australia, assessed the frequency of obscenities in online news stories, company websites, blogs, and other web sources. The study suggests that the anonymity of the internet may contribute to the higher rate of swearing among Americans online, while another study found that New Zealanders top the list for social media, and face-to-face interactions reveal Americans are way down the list.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that fossil fuel companies can challenge California's ability to set stricter emission standards for vehicles. The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, questioning a waiver California has held since 1967, allowing it to exceed federal pollution standards. The ruling overturns a lower court decision that dismissed the lawsuit, arguing the plaintiffs lacked legal standing. Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the government cannot target industries with unlawful regulations and then prevent them from challenging those regulations in court.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales have supported legalizing assisted dying, and the bill now moves to the House of Lords for consideration. In Scotland, a separate assisted dying bill is also under review, while the Isle of Man passed its Assisted Dying Bill in March 2025. The proposed law in England and Wales would allow terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of six months or less to end their lives under specific conditions. The article also clarifies the distinctions between assisted dying, assisted suicide, and euthanasia, providing context for the ongoing debates.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with a limited number of vehicles operating in a geofenced area. Access to the rides will be by invitation only, and the initial vehicles will be Model Ys rather than the CyberCab. Elon Musk has been promoting a driverless robotaxi for years, and analysts believe this service could significantly increase Tesla's market capitalization. The service is expected to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco later, starting with a small number of vehicles to ensure smooth operation.</p>

          <p>A new, unusually large yellow box junction in Maghera, County Londonderry, has sparked debate among residents, with some questioning its size and effectiveness. The markings, stretching over 40 meters, aim to improve traffic flow at a busy junction frequently used by buses and lorries. While some locals recognize the need for traffic improvements, others find the size "ridiculous" and hope it might become a tourist attraction. The Department for Infrastructure has been contacted for comment regarding the unusual dimensions of the traffic measure.</p>

          <p>The band Haim's new album, 'I Quit,' cleverly remixes the breakup-music canon for a generation wary of commitment, drawing comparisons to Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours.' The album explores unraveling commitments, with lead singer Danielle Haim's breakup from producer Ariel Rechtshaid influencing the album's themes. The music feels unshackled, with songs going on longer and doing more than expected, blending incongruous styles through ingenious transitions. The album's centerpiece tracks march from ambivalence to a different kind of ambivalence, reflecting the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle.</p>

In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly but start easing to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He emphasized that waiting for a "crash" before cutting rates is unnecessary and that the Fed has been on pause for six months with positive data.

          <p>In Texas, individuals are not obligated to answer the door for police unless they have a warrant. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring law enforcement to have valid legal authority to enter a residence. It's advisable to request to see the warrant through a window or under the door before opening. Exceptions exist in cases of "exigent circumstances," such as protecting life, preventing destruction of evidence, or pursuing a fleeing felon, but these circumstances do not create a blanket exception for unrestricted searches.</p>
