          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to justify the success of their COVID-19 medications, noting the public division between those who see them as miracles and those who disagree. His demand for transparency comes amid significant leadership changes at the CDC, which he referenced as being "ripped apart" over the issue. Trump mentioned seeing extraordinary but unreleased data from companies like Pfizer and urged them to publish their results to resolve the ongoing public and political turmoil surrounding vaccine efficacy and federal health policy. This situation is further complicated by the actions of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data, the United States has seen a reduction of 1.2 million immigrant workers in the first seven months of the year, a shift attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies. This decline is impacting sectors heavily reliant on foreign labor, such as agriculture, construction, and service industries. Economists express concern that this trend could exacerbate labor shortages, particularly as immigrants often fill crucial roles in prime working-age demographics and contribute significantly to job growth. The slowdown in immigration complicates the labor market's outlook and may affect economic stability in various states.</p>

          <p>A group of nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has publicly condemned Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

In a New York Times op-ed, they cited the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez as the culmination of a series of detrimental decisions, including gutting a key vaccine advisory committee and canceling mRNA research.

          <p>Country singer Jason Aldean revealed that he suffered a mental breakdown months after being on stage during the 2017 Route 91 Harvest festival shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest in modern U.S. history. Speaking on a podcast, Aldean described the immense emotional weight and survivor's guilt he felt, which culminated in a breakdown at his home after the birth of his son. He reflected on the terror of the event, where his pregnant wife was present, and the difficulty of processing the loss of fans and the potential loss of his own team. Aldean noted that while he funded therapy for his crew, he personally coped by discussing the trauma with his family and band members.</p>

The discovery was made on Saturday evening around the time the event's signature "Man" effigy was set to burn. Law enforcement has secured the area and is interviewing festival attendees, though no suspects or cause of death have been identified yet.

Antony's transfer is a permanent deal valued at £21.65 million, and he has signed a five-year contract with Real Betis, where he had a successful loan spell last season.

          <p>Liverpool has secured a deal to sign England defender Marc Guehi from Crystal Palace, pending final clearance from the London club. The 25-year-old center-back completed his medical and agreed to a long-term contract after the clubs settled on a transfer fee, which was initially reported as a £35 million offer. Crystal Palace is reportedly delaying the final sanction of the transfer until they secure a second replacement, having already signed Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse. Guehi's signing is part of a significant summer spending spree for Liverpool, aimed at reinforcing their defense after conceding multiple goals early in the season.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have detained at least 11 United Nations personnel in the capital, Sanaa, following a deadly Israeli airstrike on a Houthi cabinet meeting.

This crackdown is seen as part of the Houthis' response to the airstrike and a broader pattern of targeting aid workers and international staff, whom they often accuse of espionage.

Atwood's new story ironically depicts perfectly chaste characters who reproduce without sex, subtly criticizing the ban and its supporters, including Alberta Premier Danielle Smith.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a prominent meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, showcasing their deepening ties. This meeting is particularly significant as it follows the imposition of steep 50% tariffs on Indian goods by the U.S. in response to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. During their talks, both leaders emphasized their "special and privileged" partnership, focusing on regional stability and trade. Analysts suggest that U.S. economic pressure is pushing India to align more closely with Russia and China, reinforcing New Delhi's strategy of maintaining diverse international partnerships.</p>

          <p>In its UK financial accounts, iconic American brand Levi's has warned that "rising anti-Americanism" resulting from the Trump administration's tariffs and policies could negatively impact its sales in the United Kingdom. The company identified the risk that British consumers might increasingly prefer national or European brands over U.S. products. This statement is one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly linking potential sales declines to the political climate created by the current U.S. government. The warning was included alongside other market challenges, such as high inflation and competition from retailer's own-label products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, which is operated by the Scottish government, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making train travel cheaper during traditional commuter hours. The move follows a successful trial and is based on post-pandemic travel patterns that show less crowding during rush hour, providing enough capacity to accommodate more passengers. An anytime day return ticket from Glasgow to Edinburgh, for example, has been reduced from £32.60 to £16.80. This decision has sparked a debate on whether England, Wales, and Northern Ireland could adopt a similar model, with experts divided on whether it would boost ridership or lead to overcrowding and potential price hikes elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A fragile trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under pressure after President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs in response to the EU's digital services taxes and technology regulations. Trump argues these measures unfairly target American tech giants and has demanded their immediate removal, warning of "substantial additional tariffs" if they remain. The EU defends its right to regulate its digital market and tax profits generated within its borders, viewing the U.S. stance as a demand for an exemption for its companies. This renewed conflict threatens to unravel a recent agreement designed to de-escalate transatlantic trade disputes.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, the former Member of Parliament for Somerton and Frome, has died suddenly at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police confirmed he was found deceased at an address in Chelsea, and his death is being treated as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was suspended by the Conservative Party in 2022 over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied and which were later withdrawn. He ultimately resigned from Parliament in June 2023 after admitting to cocaine use, triggering a by-election for his seat. Colleagues remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents.</p>

His new single, "Slow & Easy," reunites him with the Dirty Heads, with whom he first found success on the 2010 hit "Lay Me Down."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to set tariffs, a power the Constitution largely reserves for Congress. However, the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The ruling represents a significant legal challenge to one of the president's core economic policies and could have major implications for U.S. trade strategy.</p>

The quake's epicenter was near the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar province, with tremors felt as far as Kabul and neighboring Pakistan. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the remote, mountainous terrain and landslides that have blocked roads, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters. The disaster exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, where the healthcare system has collapsed and millions require aid, with recovery efforts expected to be slow and challenging.</p>

The State Department did not explicitly confirm the move but stated it was acting in compliance with U.S. law and national security.

Climate scientists at the Met Office state that a summer this hot is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change.

Developed by Israeli figures linked to a criticized humanitarian foundation, the project would be financed by private investment in mega-projects rather than federal funds.
