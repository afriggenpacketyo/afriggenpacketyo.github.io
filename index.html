          <p>Oleksandr Usyk secured a decisive fifth-round knockout against Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium, reclaiming his status as the undisputed heavyweight champion for a second time. The Ukrainian fighter demonstrated superior skill, footwork, and power, knocking Dubois down twice before ending the bout with a powerful left hook. This victory solidifies Usyk's position as the leading heavyweight of his generation, joining Muhammad Ali as one of the only men to reign as undisputed heavyweight champion on two separate occasions. His performance is being widely praised as legendary within the boxing community.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a new target to reduce the number of sewage discharges from water companies by half by the year 2030. This pledge follows significant public anger over water pollution and comes after data revealed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution, though critics note the target is a political promise rather than a legally binding commitment. The announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny over rising consumer bills and executive bonuses amid environmental failings.</p>

          <p>Five consecutive days of severe torrential rain across South Korea have resulted in at least 14 fatalities and left 12 other individuals missing. The Interior and Safety Ministry reported that the deaths were caused by landslides, building collapses, and flash floods, particularly in the southern town of Sancheong and the Gapyeong area northeast of Seoul. Some southern regions received up to 800 millimeters (31 inches) of rainfall since the deluge began. As of Sunday, approximately 3,840 people have been evacuated from their homes, though the rain has now subsided in most parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao's return to the ring after a four-year retirement ended in a majority draw against WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. One judge scored the fight for Barrios, while the other two scored it a draw, allowing Barrios to retain his title. The 46-year-old Pacquiao showed flashes of his former speed and skill but faded in the later rounds against his younger opponent. Despite the result, Pacquiao expressed that he felt he won the fight and is open to a rematch, citing his short two-month training camp as a factor.</p>

Investigators became suspicious after discovering Patrick was shot twice in the head. After an initial mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life, concluding a bizarre case that blended pop culture with a tragic domestic crime.</p>

Doug Detrie was arrested after his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found beaten and strangled, but his Fitbit data corroborated his story that he was home and mostly asleep during the time of the murder. This case highlights the growing role of personal tech devices in criminal investigations. The data, along with DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing, ultimately led investigators to a different suspect, George Steven Burch, whose own phone's location data placed him at the crime scenes.</p>

He contends that the world is ethically fractured, lacking universally accepted principles to condemn atrocities, leading to a state of moral relativism where actions are justified by different groups. This crisis of morality, exemplified by the deliberate targeting of civilians becoming routine, allows conflicts to persist indefinitely amid public indignation and polarization.

The Southern California Guinea Pig Rescue responded to a tip about a hoarding situation and found many animals with medical issues like ringworm and open wounds, while others were deceased. The animals lacked proper food and water, surviving on corn husks. Rescue groups are now urgently seeking public assistance for fostering, adoption, and donations to cover medical care for the surviving guinea pigs, many of which are pregnant or newborns.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a comfortable six-try victory over the US Eagles in Washington D.C., in a match disrupted by lengthy delays due to lightning. Despite the challenging humidity and interruptions, the English side, featuring several new caps, demonstrated superior precision and control. The tourists established a 19-0 lead by halftime and continued to pull away, with tries from players including Jack van Poortvliet and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso. The US managed a late consolation try, but the game ultimately showcased the gap in quality between the two teams ahead of future World Cups on American soil.</p>

          <h2>WNBA All-Stars Protest Stalled Labor Negotiations with Warmup Shirts</h2>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game made a collective statement regarding their ongoing labor negotiations by wearing warmup shirts that read, "Pay us what you owe us." The protest comes after the players and the league failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in a recent meeting. The WNBA Players Association opted out of the previous CBA in search of a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. With a large gap reportedly existing between the two sides' proposals, some players have raised the possibility of a walkout if a new deal is not reached by October.</p>
