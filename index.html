          <p>In a significant positive development following devastating floods in Texas, officials in the hard-hit Kerr County announced the number of people considered missing has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is credited to extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies who verified that most individuals were safe. The update provides a measure of relief amidst a tragedy that has claimed 134 lives across the state, with 107 of those deaths occurring in Kerr County alone.</p>

          <p>Investigators successfully used 21st-century technology to solve the 2016 murder of Wisconsin mother Nicole Vander Heyden. Initially, her boyfriend was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit tracker corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the murder. Subsequently, DNA evidence from the crime scene led police to another man, George Steven Burch, whose movements were precisely tracked by his phone's Google Dashboard data, placing him at the crime scene and where the body was discarded, ultimately leading to his conviction.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered a distressing situation in a South Los Angeles home, finding more than 400 guinea pigs living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Many of the animals were suffering from medical issues like ringworm and open wounds, with some found deceased due to a lack of proper food and water. Rescue groups are now urgently seeking public support through fostering, adoptions, and donations to provide the necessary medical care and supplies for the surviving animals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly using third-country deportations as a central part of its immigration policy, as highlighted by a recent prisoner swap involving the U.S., El Salvador, and Venezuela. This strategy involves sending migrants to nations with which they have no connection, such as Eswatini and South Sudan, often in exchange for diplomatic or financial incentives. Critics and legal experts argue the practice is a departure from decades of U.S. policy and violates international obligations against returning people to places where they may face persecution.</p>
