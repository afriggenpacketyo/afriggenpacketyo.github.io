          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian drone and missile assault has struck Kyiv, resulting in at least two deaths and multiple injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the attack involved approximately 400 drones and 18 missiles, primarily targeting the capital city. The strikes caused widespread damage, destroying a healthcare center and setting fire to residential buildings, warehouses, and vehicles across eight districts. This attack is part of an escalation in Russian aerial assaults, with the UN reporting that June saw the highest civilian casualty rates in Ukraine in three years.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reduced its full-year profit forecast for 2025 due to weaker-than-expected demand and an industry-wide surplus of flights. However, the company's shares increased by 10% after it presented a third-quarter outlook that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, signaling a stabilization in travel bookings. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while corporate travel has leveled off, premium cabin sales and revenue from its American Express partnership remain strong, growing 5% and 10% respectively. The airline plans to make surgical capacity cuts after the summer peak to align with current demand patterns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay, who made history in last year's Tour de France by winning three stages and the green jersey, is facing a more difficult competition this year. Despite a strong second-place finish in the opening stage, his performance has been hampered by a knee injury. Girmay, the only African rider in this year's tour, remains a symbol of hope for his continent but has expressed disappointment with the lack of team support in some stages. He remains focused on securing a stage win and competing for the green jersey again, navigating the pressures of his past success.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have declared a major incident over a large bonfire built in south Belfast for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. Authorities are concerned because the bonfire's location near a major electricity substation poses a risk to the power supply for two major hospitals. Belfast City Council has requested police assistance to dismantle the structure, escalating local tensions and prompting protests. The event commemorates the 1690 Battle of the Boyne, but this year's bonfire has become a point of significant controversy due to safety and potential for disorder.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia briefly reached a market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday, a value exceeding the GDP of several major countries. This milestone highlights intense investor confidence in the future of artificial intelligence, a sector where Nvidia's chips are a critical component. The company's stock has surged despite challenges like US export controls limiting sales to China, from which it absorbed a $4.5 billion impact last quarter. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has become a central player in the AI race, with its success helping to bolster the wider stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a report warning that the nation faces a "rising, persistent and unpredictable threat" from Iran. The Intelligence and Security Committee's inquiry highlighted a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 assassination or kidnapping plots against UK-based individuals since early 2022. The report criticizes the government for focusing on crisis management and the nuclear issue, urging a more resourced, long-term strategy to counter Iran's full spectrum of hostile activities. The threat is reportedly comparable to that posed by Russia, targeting dissidents, as well as Jewish and Israeli interests.</p>

          <p>UK's postal regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to stop delivering second-class letters on Saturdays as part of a cost-cutting reform. The change, effective July 28, means second-class mail will be delivered on alternating weekdays. Royal Mail estimates this could save between £250m and £425m annually, citing a steep decline in letter volume from 20 billion in 2004-05 to 6.6 billion today. While first-class deliveries will continue six days a week, the move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and businesses concerned about service reduction and reliance on more expensive first-class mail.</p>

          <p>The recent catastrophic floods in Texas, which caused an estimated $18 billion to $22 billion in damages, highlight the critical importance of flood insurance for homeowners. Experts note that standard homeowners insurance policies typically exclude flood damage, requiring separate coverage that few possess; only 2.5% of homeowners in the hard-hit Kerr County had a flood policy. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reports that 99% of U.S. counties have experienced a flood event in the past 20 years. This underscores the nationwide risk and the need for broader adoption of flood insurance through various programs.</p>

          <p>A new Republican-backed spending bill signed by President Trump provides a massive $75 billion in additional funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over four years. This represents the largest single investment in domestic immigration enforcement since 2003, aiming to more than double immigration detention capacity to 116,000 beds. The bill allocates $45 billion for detention and nearly $30 billion for enforcement and deportation, incentivizing state and local collaboration with federal authorities.

          <p>Health experts in South Africa are expressing deep concern over the impact of US foreign aid cuts on HIV treatment and prevention programs. The cuts, part of a broader reduction in aid by the Trump administration, have led to the closure of many US-funded clinics that provided antiretrovirals (ARVs) to thousands, including vulnerable populations like sex workers. UNAids warns that such funding reductions risk reversing decades of progress against HIV/Aids, which had seen a 56% decline in new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. The loss of funding also threatens vital South African-led research into new HIV vaccines and treatments.</p>

          <p>This article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political dynamics, drawing parallels to its use in New York City. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two "jungle primary" system could interact with RCV in unique ways. Proponents argue RCV could save money by eliminating runoffs, increase diversity, and discourage negative campaigning. In California, it could potentially alter strategic incentives for candidates and lead to more centrist outcomes through crossover voting, though the exact effects on the state's nonpartisan system remain a subject of debate among political observers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spurred by patient testimonials on social media, the medical community is shifting its approach to pain management during IUD insertions, a procedure long downplayed as only minimally uncomfortable. Recent guidelines from the CDC and ACOG now recommend that clinicians offer local anesthetics, acknowledging that many patients, particularly those who have never given birth, experience significant pain. This change reflects a broader movement toward patient-centered care and taking women's pain seriously, challenging a history of dismissal in gynecology. The article highlights the importance of communication and offering a range of options for patients.</p>

          <p>DC Studios is betting on its new "Superman" movie, written and directed by co-head James Gunn, to revitalize its film franchise after a series of box office disappointments. The film, which is projected to have a strong opening weekend, faces the challenge of making the iconic but sometimes-perceived-as-hokey character relevant to modern audiences. Analysts see the movie as a crucial "table setter" for DC's new, more cohesive cinematic universe under Gunn and Peter Safran. The film's success is seen as vital for the future of the DC brand as it competes with rival Marvel Studios.</p>

James Clyburn. Newsom used the platform to position himself as a leader of the resistance to the Trump administration, touting California's legal challenges against it.

          <p>Years before the deadly flash flood, officials in Kerr County, Texas, knew they needed a modern flood warning system but struggled to secure funding for the nearly $1 million project. The county's applications for federal FEMA grants were turned down by the state, and a state-level grant program would have required the county to cover 95% of the cost, which was not feasible. This struggle is common for many communities that need to fund large-scale disaster preparedness projects.

The initial request was made at 4:22 a.m. as a key river gauge went underwater, but the first alert was not sent until after 6:00 a.m., with some messages arriving hours later. By then, the floodwaters had already become catastrophic. This delay in activating the county's emergency notification system, which includes the ability to send text blasts to all phones in the area, is now under scrutiny following the disaster's high death toll.</p>
