          <p>The White House is considering BlackRock's chief investment officer, Rick Rieder, as a potential successor to Jerome Powell for the role of Federal Reserve chair. Rieder recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the search and has expressed a desire for fundamental changes at the central bank. This development adds another high-profile Wall Street figure to the list of candidates, which includes former Fed governors and economists. The search occurs as the Fed is widely expected to implement an interest rate cut, a move President Trump has been demanding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described as a "targeted assassination," occurred during an outdoor debate event. The investigation, which involved reviewing security footage and social media messages, led to Robinson after his father recognized him in released photos and urged him to surrender. Kirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA, was a prominent and controversial figure in conservative politics.</p>

          <p>A recent academic assessment indicates that U.S. sanctions, imposed since 2019 over alleged human rights abuses, are having a discernible negative impact on the economy of China's Xinjiang region. The sanctions, which expanded under the Uygur Forced Labour Protection Act, have targeted 144 Chinese companies in various sectors, effectively barring them from the U.S. market. According to research from Xinjiang University, these economic pressures have led to increased local unemployment. Beijing has consistently denied the allegations of abuse and criticized the sanctions as an attempt to destabilize the region.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated that forward Raheem Sterling and defender Axel Disasi will continue to train separately from the first-team squad. The two players, who were unable to secure transfers away from the club during the recent window, are part of a group often referred to as the "bomb squad." Maresca confirmed he has not seen either player since the season began, as they use different facilities and train at different times. This decision indicates that Sterling and Disasi are not currently in the manager's plans for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>At least 193 people have died in two separate boat accidents in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. On Thursday, a vessel carrying nearly 500 passengers caught fire and capsized, while a day earlier, another motorized boat capsized, killing at least 86 people, many of whom were students. Such accidents are increasingly common in the region due to overloaded and poorly maintained vessels, a lack of life jackets, and the risks of night navigation. These tragedies highlight the dangerous state of river transport, which many rely on as an alternative to the country's limited road infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to study a potential link between vaccines and autism. The contract is justified by RPI's "unique ability" to link data, though some in the scientific community question the choice and the necessity of the research. This move aligns with the views of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long promoted such a link, despite overwhelming scientific consensus that no credible association exists.

          <p>A major cyberattack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to halt production worldwide for nearly two weeks, creating a severe financial crisis for its network of suppliers. The shutdown has already cost JLR an estimated £50 million, but smaller and medium-sized businesses in its supply chain are facing the most significant threat, with some already laying off staff. Experts warn that many of these dependent suppliers could face bankruptcy if the production stoppage continues. The UK government is now facing calls to implement a furlough scheme to prevent widespread job losses throughout the automotive supply chain.</p>

While Salesforce remains much larger by revenue, Palantir is experiencing faster growth and has surpassed Salesforce in market capitalization.

The company cited slowing demand for battery electric trucks in North America as the primary reason for reassessing its product strategy. Ram had already delayed the launch of the all-electric truck twice. Instead of a fully battery-electric vehicle, the brand will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck, the Ram 1500 REV, which includes a gasoline-powered generator. This strategic shift reflects broader adjustments within the auto industry as automakers respond to evolving market conditions for electric vehicles.</p>

As a result, migrants are being moved to a different part of the base, and water is being transported by truck for essential personnel. Critics argue this infrastructure failure demonstrates that the base is ill-equipped to handle the large number of migrants the Trump administration intends to send there.

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the imminent failure of Spirit Airlines, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier's business model is unsustainable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that the model of charging low base fares while adding fees for all other services is disliked by customers and is no longer viable. His comments come after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs. The prediction highlights the intense pressure on discount airlines as larger carriers successfully compete with their own basic economy fares and broader networks.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, co-founder and new board chairman of Opendoor, has stated the online real estate company is "bloated" and plans to reduce its workforce from 1,400 to around 200 employees. Rabois criticized the company's remote work policy and focus on diversity initiatives, claiming the culture was "broken" and needed to return to its innovative, in-person roots. The drastic overhaul comes after a change in leadership, with former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian appointed as the new CEO following investor pressure. The announcement of the leadership change initially sent the company's stock soaring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has paused a planned £200 million investment to expand its research facility in Cambridge, a project that was expected to create 1,000 jobs. This decision follows the company's cancellation of another major UK project in January and comes shortly after U.S. firm Merck scrapped its own £1 billion UK expansion. The move is seen as a significant blow to the UK's life sciences industry, which faces pressure from a perceived lack of government investment and a push by the U.S. to attract more pharmaceutical manufacturing. AstraZeneca stated it is constantly reassessing its investment needs amid a challenging economic environment.</p>

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is now investigating 11 current or former officers and one staff member based at the station. The accusations, detailed in an upcoming documentary, include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and a failure to challenge inappropriate behavior. This is not the first time the station has been under scrutiny; a 2022 IOPC report found evidence of a "disgraceful" culture of racism and misogyny among officers there.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of an expanding administration strategy to use military-led responses to crime in cities run by Democrats. Trump stated that the city is "deeply troubled" and that the deployment has the support of the state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor. Memphis Mayor Paul Young had previously indicated he would prefer financial resources for crime prevention over a military presence. This move follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and reflects the administration's aggressive stance on urban crime.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The lawsuit claims Uber routinely denies service to passengers with service animals or stowable mobility devices, and unfairly charges fees for cleaning or cancellations related to these denials. The DOJ argues that these practices prevent individuals with disabilities from reliably using Uber for essential transportation. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials, pointing to its driver training and dedicated reporting channels.</p>

The plan redraws districts to dismantle a Kansas City-area seat long held by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, splitting its voters into more conservative-leaning districts. The move is part of a broader, Trump-backed national push by Republicans to redraw maps mid-decade to bolster their narrow House majority ahead of the midterm elections.

Industry leaders, including Mercedes-Benz chief Ola Kaellenius, have called the 2035 target "no longer feasible" and are pushing for a relaxation of the rules to include other low-emission technologies.
