          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, especially among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support decreases if the focus is not seen as dangerous criminals, with half of Americans believing Trump is deporting more people than expected. While more people feel the program enhances safety, views on its economic impact are negative, with concerns about weakening the economy. The poll also reveals that Trump's approval rating on immigration is higher than on the economy, and Democrats doubt their party's ability to challenge Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>The article critiques America's infatuation with narratives about powerful men and their origin stories, particularly in the tech industry, citing examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. It argues that this obsession leads to a tolerance of unethical behavior and a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. The author criticizes the romanticized portrayal of these figures in media, such as Aaron Sorkin's "The Social Network," and calls for a shift away from blindly celebrating people for simply "changing the world." The piece also touches on the mythologizing of the Founding Fathers and the dangers of founder myths.</p>

          <p>New research from Morgan Stanley indicates that major retailers reliant on China and other markets for production are increasing prices due to Trump's tariffs. The average footwear price increased by 13% in May, compared to a 1% average over the previous six months, with Under Armour and ON Holdings cited as being aggressive on recent price hikes. This follows earlier warnings from Walmart CFO John David Rainey about noticeable price increases in the coming weeks due to the tariffs. Consumer Price Index data and inflation expectations have been relatively stable, but these new findings suggest potential negative surprises for inflation reports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how Trump's policies have diminished the perceived threat of "peaceful evolution" in China, a concept that warned against American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party. Mao Zedong cautioned about this threat, but now China has emerged as a global power while the US has shifted away from nation-building. The author suggests that Trump's actions have ironically reduced America's ability to influence China through cultural or ideological means, as the US has stopped lecturing others on governance.</p>

          <p>Arthur Sze's poem "Under a Supermoon" reflects on the beauty and minutiae of life, contrasting it with the vastness of space exploration. The speaker expresses a lack of desire for grand adventures, instead finding joy in simple observations like the color of leaves and the smell of piñon. The poem references Blake's idea that persisting in folly leads to wisdom, suggesting the speaker has persevered and now appreciates the exploding and birthing stars within life. The poem evokes a sense of contentment and gratitude.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The column emphasizes open communication and stating one's needs, drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy of love as active support for a partner's flourishing. It cautions against both masochistic and sadistic approaches to love, advocating for a balance between affirming a partner's freedom and respecting one's own boundaries. The piece suggests exploring the possibility of genuine interest in non-monogamy, strengthening the emotional security of the current relationship, and setting clear boundaries before considering any changes.</p>

American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route, which is approximately 20 feet shorter than the 787-9.

          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs is challenged by the aviation industry's struggle to hire skilled workers. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, with 40% over 60, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Companies are trying to attract younger people, but the industry lost talent during Covid-19.

          <p>Scotland has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's Callan McKenna to address a goalkeeping crisis ahead of Monday's friendly in Liechtenstein.
