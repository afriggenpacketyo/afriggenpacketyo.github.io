            <h2>Judge Believes Trump Administration Acted in Contempt Over Deportation Flights</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 12:26:34 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Judge James Boasberg has indicated that the Trump administration likely acted in contempt of court for defying an order to turn around deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The judge stated that the government's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the court's order, sufficient to conclude probable cause exists for criminal contempt. This ruling underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the administration's immigration policies and its adherence to judicial orders, highlighting potential constitutional implications. The judge emphasized that the Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders, especially by officials sworn to uphold it.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts a decline in global trade this year due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, with a particularly steep decline expected in North America. The WTO suggests that reciprocal tariffs and political uncertainty could further exacerbate the decline, potentially leading to a global recession. While some regions like Asia and Europe are projected to see modest trade growth, the overall outlook is negative, with the WTO Director General expressing concern over the "decoupling" of the US and China. The report also includes a forecast for services trade, projecting a 4% growth in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California is launching a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariffs, arguing that the president has overstepped his authority and is causing significant harm to the state's economy. The lawsuit asserts that the power to impose tariffs lies explicitly with Congress, and the president's invocation of emergency powers is unlawful. California, heavily reliant on trade with Mexico, Canada, and China, anticipates significant economic consequences from the tariffs. Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta are holding a press conference to address the impact on California's farmers and businesses.</p>

            <p>A colossal squid, the world's largest squid species, has been filmed and photographed in its natural habitat for the first time since its discovery a century ago. The footage was captured by a research vessel in the South Atlantic Ocean, showing a juvenile squid approximately 11 feet long at a depth of 2,000 feet. This unprecedented sighting provides valuable insights into the elusive deep-sea creature, which can grow up to 43 feet long and weigh over 1,100 pounds.

            <p>Fencer Stephanie Turner is facing difficulties and backlash after taking a knee in protest against competing against a transgender athlete. She was honored as a Courage Wins Champion but also faced expulsion from the event and a USA Fencing investigation, resulting in probation for 12 months. Turner says many women are afraid to speak out against trans inclusion due to potential social ostracism, financial repercussions, and disrupted training. She is now taking a break from fencing in the U.S. to focus on advocating for banning trans athletes from women's sports.</p>

            <p>Burglars tunneled through a concrete wall to steal at least $10 million worth of goods from a Los Angeles jewelry store. The heist occurred at Love Jewels on Broadway, with the suspects drilling a hole from an adjacent property. Security camera footage captured the suspects entering the store, and police are investigating the incident. The burglars fled in a Chevy truck, and the theft was discovered when employees arrived for work the following morning.</p>

            <p>Wall Street banks are experiencing record profits from stock trading due to the volatility created by the Trump administration's policies. Major banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America have reported record equities trading revenue. The increased activity in currencies, commodities, and bond markets has also contributed to higher revenue for fixed income personnel. Analysts suggest that as long as the volatility continues, equities trading desks will remain busy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Massachusetts detective, Brian Fanion, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators discovered peculiar web searches on his work computer in the months leading up to her death. These searches included common household poisons, dangerous sources of radiation, and gunshot residue testing. Eleven days before Amy's death, Fanion searched "gsr testing" and visited web pages related to gunshot residue collection, despite not being assigned to any active investigations that would necessitate such research. Fanion's conviction is currently under appeal.</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court ruled that the term "woman" in the Equality Act 2010 refers to someone's biological sex. The ruling came in response to challenges brought by For Women Scotland, focusing on the definition of "woman" in Scottish legislation. The court stressed that its ruling was limited to interpreting the 2010 law and does not define the meaning of "woman" beyond the provisions of that legislation. The ruling has sparked debate and varying reactions from LGBTQ+ rights groups and campaigners for women's rights.</p>

            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced that Mexico will not renew diplomatic relations with Ecuador while Daniel Noboa remains in office. This decision stems from Ecuador's raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito in April 2024. The raid involved the arrest of former Ecuadorean Vice President Jorge Glas, who had been living in the embassy and granted diplomatic asylum by Mexico. Sheinbaum had previously supported Noboa's opponent in the presidential election.</p>

            <p>Promoter Eddie Hearn believes that a fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua could be agreed upon with a simple text message exchange between the fighters. Hearn, who represents Joshua, suggests that both fighters are huge names nearing the end of their careers, making the fight a highly anticipated event. A super-fight between the two British boxing stars has been discussed for years but has consistently stalled during negotiations. With neither fighter currently holding a championship, the stakes are high for this potential match.</p>
