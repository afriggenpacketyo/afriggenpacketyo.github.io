          <p>Frank Bisignano, the newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), revealed during a town hall with agency staff that he had to Google the job to understand it after being offered the position. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, acknowledged his lack of prior experience with the SSA and government work. He assured employees that Social Security was "not going away" and that President Trump supported the agency. Bisignano also emphasized the need for the SSA to adopt a "digital-first" approach, comparing the agency's services to the user experience offered by tech giants like Amazon, which will involve the aid of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>Zurab Japaridze, a leader of Georgia's largest opposition party, has been placed in pre-trial detention amidst a government crackdown on dissent following protests last year. Japaridze, a leader of the Coalition for Change, refused to appear at an inquiry into alleged crimes committed between 2004 and 2012, during the term of ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili. Japaridze has denounced the parliamentary probe as being illegitimate and unduly influenced by the ruling party. The opposition accuses the government of mimicking authoritarian tactics and steering the country away from European aspirations, with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze postponing accession talks with Brussels until 2028.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken a significant step in its ongoing conflict with Harvard University by revoking the university's ability to enroll international students. The decision, conveyed in a letter from the Department of Homeland Security, follows disputes over records requests and broader disagreements about the university's policies. The administration asserts Harvard failed to provide "pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies." This move is expected to have substantial financial implications for Harvard, given the significant proportion of international students who attend and pay tuition.</p>

Climate change is contributing to the increased frequency and intensity of storms, with abnormally high sea surface temperatures playing a significant role.

The initial removal was based on the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms related to DEI, race, and gender issues, bringing the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>The Senate has voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move opposed by Democrats and questioned by nonpartisan government watchdogs. The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the state's "EV mandate" requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, but Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California's Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue the federal government if Congress uses Congressional Review to revoke the waivers.</p>

The report paints a bleak picture of American childhood, describing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and mental illness. It targets technology companies and social media platforms for contributing to a "technology-driven lifestyle." The report reiterates talking points about vaccines, while notably omitting the claim that vaccines cause autism. It emphasizes the role of ultraprocessed foods and synthetic chemicals in declining children's health, while stopping short of calling glyphosate and atrazine unsafe.</p>

          <p>A report reveals that only a fraction of fire cleanup workers are adequately protecting themselves against toxic debris in the Eaton burn area. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) found that most workers surveyed were not wearing gloves, masks, or Tyvek suits, as required by safety regulations. NDLON has been responding to post-disaster worker safety issues for decades, recalling similar issues following 9/11. The organization is providing PPE and training to workers, emphasizing the responsibility of employers to ensure worker safety. The report hopes to raise awareness and pressure the government to enforce compliance.</p>

          <p>Conflict in Thailand's deep south, between Thai military forces and separatist groups seeking greater autonomy, has persisted for over two decades. The violence, largely confined to the southernmost provinces, has seen a surge in incidents this year. The Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), the dominant separatist group, has been implicated in attacks targeting civilians. While the Thai government has expressed willingness to engage in peace talks, analysts believe these efforts are more symbolic than practical. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has become involved to help find a solution, aiming to end the unrest by next year, while Malaysia is urged to take a greater role in peace efforts.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision, has blocked Oklahoma from using government funds to run the nationâ€™s first religious charter school. The tie vote, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recusing herself, upholds a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the school violated the U.S. Constitution. The deadlock sets no nationwide precedent on the question of whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools. The school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, aimed to incorporate Catholic teachings into its activities. The decision has sparked debate among proponents and critics of expanded school choice and religious charter education.</p>

He was convicted in 1990 based on witness testimony and circumstantial evidence, including insurance policies on the victims. Despite new DNA evidence, requests to reopen the case were denied. The execution marks the resumption of Tennessee executions after a five-year hiatus due to COVID-19 and missteps by the Department of Corrections.

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally on Thursday, hitting a new record high above $111,000. The price of the cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $111,578.76, according to Coin Metrics. The climb for the cryptocurrency has been slower than usual, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have been key catalysts. The price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, and Bitcoin ETFs have seen strong and steady inflows. U.S. President Donald Trump and his AI and crypto czar David Sacks have pushed forward a pro-crypto agenda in the U.S., which has helped support the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Education unions have welcomed the decision, but warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding.

Resident doctors will get an extra Â£750 top-up, bringing their average rise to 5.4%. The British Medical Association (BMA) has deemed the rise "woefully inadequate" and plans to ballot them next week over possible strike action.

This case is developing amid a debate over gun safety rules in Georgia, with lawmakers recently holding a hearing on safe firearm storage. The testimony got pretty emotional as a police chief, a pediatric nurse and a tearful parent encouraged lawmakers to take action - action like incentivizing the use of gun safes but also making it a criminal offense when adults don't lock up weapons that kids get a hold of.</p>

The ANC sees the law as a milestone in the country's transformation, but the Democratic Alliance is challenging it in court. The Freedom Front Plus fears a threat to private ownership. Tensions mounted during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Trump issued an executive order stating that the law enabled the South African government "to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation."</p>

Joun also blocked transferring the management of federal student loans and special education functions out of the Education Department. All fired federal employees from the department must be reinstated as well. The judge stated that the RIF would likely cripple the Department and that there was no evidence that the RIF had made the Department more efficient.
