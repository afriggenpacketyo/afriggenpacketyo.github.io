            <h2>IDF Inquiry Reveals 'Professional Failures' in Killing of Gaza Medics</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 16:27:44 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) into the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month concluded that "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders," led to the tragic incident. The investigation found that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, but poor night visibility contributed to the misidentification of the vehicles as ambulances. The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed, and another commanding officer will receive a reprimand. The Red Crescent and other international organizations had called for an independent investigation, deeming the IDF's report as inadequate and shifting responsibility.</p>

            <p>Despite President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a one-day Easter ceasefire, both Ukraine and Russia accused each other of violating the agreement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and attacks, suggesting Putin may not have full control over his army or is using the ceasefire for PR purposes. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region, causing civilian casualties, while maintaining that Russian troops strictly observed the ceasefire. The failure to uphold the ceasefire occurred amidst ongoing negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, with President Trump expressing hope for a deal this week.</p>

            <p>A chainsaw-wielding vandal caused outrage by cutting down numerous trees in downtown Los Angeles, damaging the city's urban canopy. The Los Angeles Police Department and the city's Urban Forestry Division are investigating the incident, which occurred just before Earth Day. Social media users condemned the act, speculating about the motives behind it, ranging from eco-terrorism to a conspiracy to bypass city bureaucracy for tree removal. The felled trees, many of which were drought-resistant Indian laurel figs, provided important benefits to the urban environment, including stormwater capture, air purification, and cooling effects.</p>

            <p>Leicester City is facing relegation after a series of poor performances and managerial changes. The team struggled to adapt after Enzo Maresca's departure, and subsequent manager Steve Cooper failed to connect with the players, leading to his dismissal. Despite Ruud van Nistelrooy's arrival bringing initial optimism, results continued to decline, with the team equalling a club-record run of defeats. Concerns have been raised about the standard and intensity of training, and tensions have grown, exemplified by a fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks, ultimately leading to their relegation.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing bipartisan criticism for the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, due to an "administrative error." Senator John Kennedy, a Republican, called the deportation a "screw up," while Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, described it as a "constitutional crisis." The administration has refused to bring back Abrego Garcia despite a Supreme Court order, and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has dismissed the idea of his release. The situation has sparked debate over due process and the rights of individuals facing deportation.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Solicitor General John Sauer called the order "unprecedented" and argued that the detainees have no standing to seek an injunction since the government has paused their deportations. Sauer implored the justices to limit the order to a pause on AEA removals, rather than any removals of Venezuelan gang members, as the lower courts have not found critical facts in this case.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including closing embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy and human rights. The order aims to "streamline mission delivery" and align the department with an "American First Strategic Doctrine." It also proposes consolidating regional bureaus into four "regional corps" and altering hiring practices to prioritize alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. The White House has not commented on the draft order, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the report as "fake news."</p>

A win for the federal government could boost the power that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in shaping those requirements. Kennedy has questioned a litany of public health recommendations, and a victory in this case could put him in more direct control of at least one expert panel focused on those policies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is defending the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) before the Supreme Court, concerning mandates for preventive services coverage. A win for the government could boost the power of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in shaping those requirements. The case concerns the legality of no cost-sharing coverage mandates created by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Millions of Americans' access to cost-free preventive services is at stake, including cancer screenings and HIV prevention drugs. A ruling in the government's favor would leave those mandates intact for now, but the fight over how those mandates are crafted will continue.</p>
