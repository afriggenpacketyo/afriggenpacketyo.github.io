        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Dignity Act of 2025, has been introduced in the House by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar and Veronica Escobar. The legislation would offer a seven-year renewable legal status and work authorization to immigrants who have been in the U.S. since before 2021, provided they pay restitution and have good conduct. The bill explicitly offers no path to citizenship or federal benefits and is designed to be funded by participant fees, not taxpayer money. It also aims to enhance border security, mandate E-Verify for employers, and address labor needs amid the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>At a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by building energy-intensive data centers and an energy innovation training center in the Pittsburgh region. The investments, which include plans for new nuclear reactors and support for the U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel partnership, are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers in the state, signaling a major push to establish Pennsylvania as a hub for AI and energy.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's seventh congressional district, a seat previously held by her late father, Raúl Grijalva. A Pima County supervisor, the 54-year-old Grijalva defeated 25-year-old activist and social media influencer Deja Foxx in a race that highlighted a generational divide within the party. Foxx had challenged Grijalva on her 'legacy last name,' while Grijalva emphasized her extensive experience in local politics. The district is heavily Democratic, making Grijalva the strong favorite to win the general election and succeed her father in Congress.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of the 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback, has died of throat cancer at age 67. Murdoch was serving a life sentence and consistently maintained his innocence, never revealing the location of Falconio's body. The crime also involved the attempted kidnapping and assault of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Northern Territory Police expressed regret that Murdoch's death denies the Falconio family closure, and a substantial reward for information leading to the discovery of the remains is still active.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated at an expo in Beijing that artificial intelligence and robotics will power the world's factories within the next ten years. He emphasized that AI is becoming fundamental infrastructure, revolutionizing supply chains by changing how goods are built and moved, particularly in replacing humans in repetitive or hazardous jobs. Huang, visiting China for the third time this year, also noted that Nvidia is poised to resume shipments of its made-for-China H20 chips. He applauded the progress of Chinese tech firms, highlighting how AI has empowered major platforms like WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows the advancement of the 'SCORE Act' by a House subcommittee, which aims to supersede varied state laws governing how college athletes can be compensated. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have allowed student-athletes to earn millions from endorsements and other activities, significantly altering the landscape of college sports. While the initiative has bipartisan support, concerns remain that it could grant excessive power to the NCAA without sufficiently protecting the athletes' interests.</p>

          <p>An article revisits the last American firebombing of a Japanese city during World War II, which occurred in Kumagaya on August 14-15, 1945, less than 12 hours before Japan's surrender. The raid, part of a campaign conceived by Gen. Curtis LeMay, involved nearly 90 B-29 bombers dropping napalm, killing over 260 people and destroying much of the city. The report includes poignant recollections from survivors who were children at the time, detailing the devastation and long-lasting trauma. It also explores the moral complexities of the firebombing campaign, which some, including former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, later acknowledged could have been considered war crimes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he stated will set a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the U.S. in exchange for American firms gaining tariff-free access to the Indonesian market. In a social media post, Trump added that the agreement includes Indonesian commitments to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The announcement follows a pattern of the administration using tariff threats to negotiate new trade terms, with similar recent deals struck with Vietnam and the UK.

          <p>Senate Republicans have narrowly advanced a legislative package, at President Trump's request, to rescind approximately $9 billion in previously approved spending. The measure, which passed a key procedural vote 51-50 with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, primarily targets foreign aid programs and funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. To secure support, an initial proposal to cut the PEPFAR global HIV/AIDS program was removed. Democrats strongly oppose the bill, arguing it undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and will harm vital services, while Republicans frame it as a necessary first step toward fiscal responsibility.</p>

The deportees, originally from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen, had convictions for serious offenses including murder and child sexual assault, and their home countries had reportedly refused to accept them. This action is part of a broader, aggressive U.S. policy to secure agreements with third countries to accept deportees who cannot be returned to their nations of origin.

Johnson's call for transparency reflects growing pressure from some Republicans, including Rep. Tim Burchett and Sen.

This directive came after country singer John Rich's campaign against a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville gained President Trump's attention. The board resisted, defending Moul's performance. Sources suggest this move may be a pretext for Trump to install a more aligned CEO and advance a long-held goal of privatizing the TVA.

          <p>It has been revealed that thousands of Afghans were secretly relocated to the UK under a new scheme established after a major data breach by a British official. In 2022, the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK resettlement were inadvertently leaked. The government learned of the breach in 2023 and subsequently created a secret £400m relocation route, which has so far brought 4,500 people to the UK. The existence of the leak and the program was concealed by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted, citing free speech and public accountability concerns.</p>

The first, a bold 'Charger Power' look, features all-gold jerseys and pants, a first for the team in a game. The second is a 'Super Chargers' uniform with navy blue jerseys, pants, and helmets, designed as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and 2000s. The gold uniforms have already generated significant online reaction, drawing comparisons to everything from mustard to the Minions.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on Jeffrey Epstein that she deems 'credible.' This comment comes as the administration faces a rare backlash from some conservative supporters over its handling of the case, after Bondi said there was no evidence of an Epstein 'client list.' While Trump has urged supporters to move on from the controversy, key allies like House Speaker Mike Johnson are calling for more transparency. In his remarks, Trump praised Bondi's handling of the matter but ultimately left the decision to release information up to her discretion.</p>

          <p>Former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who died at the age of 82 after an undisclosed illness, was buried in his hometown of Daura. Thousands of people, including current President Bola Tinubu, attended the service to pay their respects. Buhari led Nigeria twice, first as a military dictator in the 1980s and later as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by a clampdown on human rights, isolationist economic policies, and escalating insecurity. After handing over power in 2023, he largely withdrew from public life while seeking medical treatment in London.</p>

Bell had fatally shot the pair outside a bar in what authorities described as an attempted revenge killing targeting the wrong person, as West had recently bought a car from the intended target. Bell was also convicted in three other separate murders. His execution is the 26th in the United States this year, surpassing the total for all of 2024, and the eighth in Florida, which has executed more people than any other state in 2025.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, some migrant workers are using mobile apps that crowdsource and display the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. An app named Coqui allows users to see reported ICE activity, helping them avoid potential arrest and detention, even if they have legal status. The founder of the app, an animal rescue operator, created it after his employees became too scared to leave their homes for work. ICE officials have expressed concern that such apps are dangerous and could be used to impede law enforcement efforts or ambush agents.</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor, Paulo Gonet, has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup after his 2022 election loss. In a detailed filing, Gonet accused Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an 'armed criminal association' to 'violently overthrow the democratic order.' The charges stem from evidence that Bolsonaro spread unfounded voter fraud claims and was tied to a potential military takeover plot, which culminated in the January 8, 2023 riots in Brasília. If convicted, the former president could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks are buying gold directly from local mines in their own countries rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to acquire the precious metal at a discount, support local industry, and build reserves without depleting foreign currency holdings like the U.S. dollar. Countries like Ghana, Tanzania, and the Philippines are among those using this approach to bolster their reserves as gold prices reach record highs. The trend is driven by a desire to hedge against geopolitical risks and strengthen monetary buffers. (not investment advice)</p>

His conviction was overturned in 2021 after efforts by the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit.

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling parts of the U.S. Department of Education, policy experts are weighing the impact. Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute noted that while President Trump campaigned on closing the department, he lacks the congressional support to do so. The current layoffs, however, will significantly affect areas like the Office for Civil Rights and the Federal Student Aid office. Petrilli argues that while these cuts are unlikely to be noticed by most teachers and students daily, they represent a retreat from federal efforts to improve schools.</p>

The recommendations follow a heated debate over the responsibilities of these roles and concerns from families of patients who died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.

A key part of the plan involves the complex process of moving 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad that weighs over a tonne.
