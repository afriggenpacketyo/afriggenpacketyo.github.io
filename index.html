          <p>Iranian state media reported that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on Friday in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites.  Israeli media reported casualties, including one death and over 60 injuries, from the Iranian counterstrike.  The Iranian envoy to the UN accused the United States of complicity in the Israeli attack, escalating tensions between the two nations.

          <p>Approximately 200 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel following protests related to immigration enforcement operations.

          <p>Chinese researchers published a study in Nature Machine Intelligence suggesting that large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously create a human-like system for comprehending and categorizing natural objects.

The research focused on the ability of LLMs to develop object representations from linguistic and multimodal data.

The administration is now pursuing his detention on alternative grounds, alleging he lied on his green-card application. Khalil's lawyers argue this is a pretext for his detention.
