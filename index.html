          <p>Chinese humanoid robotics startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in a new funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to around $280 million. The company, which aims to create "robotic butlers" within five years, also released an open-source AI model for robotics called Wall-OSS to accelerate development in the field. Despite the significant investment and ambitious goals, the startup acknowledges that AI for robotics lags behind conversational AI and that mass-market consumer robots are still years away. The company plans to prepare for an IPO next year while expanding sales to commercial clients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rapid ice melt at the Dachstein Glacier in Austria has uncovered a ski lift that was buried under ice in the late 1970s, serving as a stark visual indicator of accelerating climate change. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers in the European Alps to retreat at record speeds, with some losing inches of ice per day during summer heatwaves. This glacial loss is a primary contributor to rising sea levels, which in turn increases the risk of destructive flooding and disrupts ecosystems worldwide. The article notes that while the damage is significant, collective efforts to reduce pollution and reliance on fossil fuels can help slow further glacial retreat.</p>

Davies was instrumental in keeping the band together after co-founder Roger Hodgson's departure in 1983. His distinctive vocals and Wurlitzer piano playing were central to Supertramp's signature sound, leaving a lasting mark on rock music history.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Mars Has a Solid Inner Core, Similar to Earth</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by Chinese and American scientists has determined that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a finding that challenges previous models of the planet's composition. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, researchers found a solid core approximately 600km in radius, which is proportionally similar to Earth's. This discovery is significant because it was believed Mars had not cooled sufficiently to form a solid core, suggesting planetary cooling processes may be faster than previously thought. The finding places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as celestial bodies in our solar system confirmed to have solid inner cores.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw a significant 1.5% rise after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend. Investors reacted positively to the news, with the Topix index also climbing to a record high, reportedly due to excitement over potential pro-growth successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae. The market's response reflects anticipation of policies focused on deregulation and growth, despite the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar. This political shift introduces a period of uncertainty but has initially been welcomed by financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a recent column by Rahm Emanuel, which suggested that viewing China as an external threat could unify American politics. The author argues that this premise is flawed and that America has a history of needing an external enemy to foster internal cohesion. The piece refutes Emanuel's assertion that China views the U.S. as a strategic adversary, suggesting this is a misinterpretation of Chinese economic perspectives. It concludes that blaming China for America's internal divisions, such as the re-election of Donald Trump, is a way of avoiding responsibility for domestic political failures.</p>

While defending the raid, Trump suggested a need for a system where foreign experts could legally enter the U.S. to train the domestic workforce in complex industries. The president's comments came after South Korea expressed regret over the detention of over 300 of its citizens in the raid. Trump later reiterated his stance on social media, emphasizing that foreign investment is welcome but must be accompanied by legal hiring practices.</p>

Bayrou initiated the vote himself in an attempt to force parliamentary consensus on an austerity budget designed to tackle France's spiraling national debt. However, the move is seen as a political gamble likely to fail, as President Emmanuel Macron's minority government lacks the necessary support in a deeply divided parliament. The ongoing deadlock has fueled public frustration and bolstered support for far-right parties, while the prospect of another snap election remains unlikely.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of "living apart together" (LAT) through the story of a couple who have been happily married for 15 years while residing in different countries. Margaret lives and works in London, while her husband, Peter, remains in their family home in Australia, with the pair seeing each other once every year or two. The arrangement began after their children left home and Margaret pursued a new career, highlighting how couples can have different life goals while maintaining a strong relationship. Experts note that while uncommon, such arrangements can work by providing space and preserving individual identity within a marriage.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026. The carousel, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and a subsequent ownership dispute. Built in 1926, the merry-go-round is one of the few remaining wooden carousels of its kind and features hand-carved horses by famed artist Charles Looff. The city plans to undertake significant repairs before reopening the attraction as part of a broader park restoration project.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia to capitalize on the region's booming artificial intelligence sector. According to Bank of America, a weakening U.S. dollar and the prospect of easier Federal Reserve monetary policy are driving this shift. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, investment has slowed this year, with inflows now evenly split between U.S. and international markets. The global AI market is projected to grow to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a substantial portion expected to be deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for more than 91,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid electric vehicles from model years 2022 to 2026. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a software error in the hybrid control processor can cause an unexpected loss of drive power. This sudden propulsion loss could occur without warning and potentially lead to a crash. While Chrysler is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect, a remedy is currently being developed, and owners will be notified starting in October.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a spectacular "Blood Moon," visible to observers across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns perfectly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the moon a deep reddish hue. This color is the result of sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, where shorter blue wavelengths are filtered out, allowing longer red wavelengths to reach the moon. The event, which has captivated civilizations for millennia, was best viewed in Asia, including India and China.</p>

Their solicitor stated that the attack was known to be preventable and that the inquiry must establish how and why systems failed.

Mandates for other diseases, including measles and polio, will remain in place unless state lawmakers pass new legislation.

An appeals court recently found that most of Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal, a decision the administration is appealing with a request for an expedited ruling. Bessent expressed confidence that the administration will win but acknowledged that a loss would require refunding about half the tariffs collected, which could total between $750 billion and $1 trillion.
