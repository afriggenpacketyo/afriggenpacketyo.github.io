          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England over a pay dispute with the government has led to widespread cancellations of surgeries and appointments. Patients with serious conditions, including cancer and urgent needs for surgery, have expressed anger and fear, worrying that the delays could worsen their health outcomes. While the government insists disruption is minimal, personal accounts reveal significant impacts on families who feel they are in limbo. The British Medical Association has expressed regret over the necessity of the strike action.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is in place for U.S. President Donald Trump's four-day private visit to Scotland, where he is staying at his Turnberry golf resort. The visit involves meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, alongside protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. Concerns have been raised about the cost and staffing impact of the extensive security, which includes road closures, naval patrols, and drones. Trump used the visit to criticize European migration policies and wind farms.</p>

          <p>Overnight drone and missile strikes by both Russia and Ukraine have resulted in at least five civilian deaths across both countries. Ukrainian officials reported three fatalities in the Dnipropetrovsk region from a large-scale Russian assault, while Russia's Rostov governor confirmed two deaths from a Ukrainian drone strike. The attacks coincide with battlefield updates, with Russia claiming territorial gains and Ukraine reporting successful counter-offensives in the Sumy region. These exchanges occurred as recent ceasefire talks in Istanbul failed to produce a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's newly appointed prime minister, is facing immediate skepticism and overtly sexist criticism, with some dismissing her as a mere loyalist to President Zelensky. This reaction mirrors the challenges faced by other female leaders in Eastern Europe, who are often initially underestimated. Despite a strong resume that includes extensive experience in international trade and economic policy, Svyrydenko must navigate a political culture where female leadership is still met with suspicion. Her first test will be to assert her independence amid government moves to tighten control over anti-corruption agencies.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the cultural impact of Sean "Puffy" Combs, who for a time was a formidable ambassador of Black cool and a symbol of aspirational success in the 1990s. The author describes how Combs's image of ambition and his ability to integrate Black culture into mainstream luxury spaces were highly influential for a generation. However, recent revelations of his alleged cruelty and depravity have curdled that legacy, leaving former admirers feeling a sense of betrayal and heartbreak over the tarnishing of a once-inspirational figure.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, more Americans are experiencing mental health issues, including a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in the summer. The extreme heat forces people indoors, limiting sun exposure, exercise, and social interaction, which can contribute to depression, anxiety, and restlessness. While winter SAD is well-studied, summer SAD is less understood but presents with symptoms like insomnia and reduced appetite. Experts express concern that escalating heat will further exacerbate mental health conditions across the population.</p>

          <p>An attack on a courthouse in Zahedan, the capital of Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province, has left at least nine people dead, including civilians and assailants. The Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) has claimed responsibility for the assault. The province, bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to Iran's Baloch minority and is one of the country's least developed regions. It frequently experiences deadly clashes involving militant groups who cite long-standing grievances of economic and political marginalization by the Shiite-majority government.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss transatlantic trade relations and avoid a looming trade war. The meeting comes as Trump threatens to impose tariffs of up to 30% on EU goods, with a deadline approaching. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential framework deal could include a 15% baseline tariff on EU imports to the U.S. Such an agreement would provide stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.

          <p>Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of an alleged "birthday book" compiled for his 50th birthday. The request follows a Wall Street Journal report that the book contains a "bawdy" letter from Donald Trump, a claim Trump denies. Lawmakers state the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and to the Trump administration's selective release of related files. The request comes as the committee prepares to depose longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>This article tells the story of a Mexican family who, fearing the Trump administration's immigration policies, chose to "self-deport" from Arizona back to Mexico. After saving $5,000 and building a new life in the U.S., they packed their truck and drove to the border. Upon crossing into Mexico, they were stopped by Mexican officials who confiscated their truck and their entire life savings, leaving them destitute. Their story highlights the perilous choices facing immigrants and the unintended, tragic consequences of policies that encourage voluntary departure without ensuring safe return.</p>

          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the brink of closure, and its future is further threatened by proposed federal Medicaid cuts. The hospital, which serves a community with high rates of poverty, relies on Medicaid and Medicare for 80% of its revenue. A bill championed by the Trump administration would mandate the largest funding reduction in Medicaid's history, which is projected to cause 10 million Americans to lose health coverage. This poses an existential threat to Pemiscot Memorial and other rural hospitals that are essential to their communities.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, a deaf writer reflects on growing up as part of the "ADA generation," for whom the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 opened up a world of accessibility and opportunity. She contrasts her own positive experiences with the current political climate, where she sees the rights of disabled people under threat from a hostile administration and budget cuts to essential programs like Medicaid. The author calls on her generation to move beyond taking the ADA for granted and to actively fight for its preservation and expansion for future generations.</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals that the prevalence of advanced liver scarring has more than doubled among heavy drinkers in the U.S. over the last two decades. This increase is not due to higher alcohol consumption but appears linked to changing health profiles, as heavy drinkers are now more likely to have metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes. The rise in liver disease was particularly pronounced in women, older individuals, and ethnic minorities. Researchers warn that liver disease is often "silent," with no symptoms until it is advanced.</p>

The author argues that promoting this artwork, which glorifies westward expansion at the expense of Native Americans, reveals the racist and white-supremacist underpinnings of the Trump administration's ideology. The piece connects the post to the "Heritage American" movement, which prioritizes Americans with generational roots over recent immigrants, and criticizes this vision as exclusionary and historically ignorant.</p>

          <p>A recent ICE raid on Glass House Brands, one of California's largest licensed cannabis operators, has sent shockwaves through the legal cannabis industry. The raid, which resulted in hundreds of detentions and one worker's death, has created fear and confusion about the federal government's stance on state-legal businesses. The incident highlights the precarious position of the industry, which still relies on undocumented labor and operates under a conflict between state legalization and federal prohibition. The action raises questions about whether it signals a new federal crackdown on the industry.</p>

          <p>An analysis of ICE data reveals that the Trump administration's claim of deporting the "worst of the worst" is misleading, at least in the Los Angeles area. In June, nearly 70% of immigrants arrested in the region had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This contradicts the administration's public focus on "heinous illegal alien criminals." Critics and analysts suggest the focus on non-criminals is necessary to meet aggressive arrest quotas, as there are not enough immigrants with serious criminal records to fulfill the administration's mass deportation goals.</p>
