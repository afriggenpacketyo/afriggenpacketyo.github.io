          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following U.S. Government Approval</h2>

          <p>Nvidia announced it will soon resume selling its H20 AI chips to China after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. This decision reverses a previous ban on the advanced chips, which had been specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls. The move is seen as a significant win for Nvidia, which had lobbied against the restrictions, and follows high-level discussions between the company's CEO and U.S. officials. The resumption of sales is expected to be a major growth catalyst for the company in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A significant amount of unreleased music, video footage, and tour plans for the artist Beyoncé were stolen from a rented vehicle in Atlanta. The theft occurred when two suitcases were taken from the trunk of an SUV used by her choreographer and a dancer. The stolen items included two laptops and five thumb drives containing the unreleased material. Police have issued an arrest warrant for a suspect after detecting fingerprints at the scene and reviewing CCTV footage of the robbery, which happened just before the star's scheduled performances in the city.</p>

          <p>The trial has commenced for James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes with cyanide and tetrahydrozoline. Prosecutors are focusing on Craig's internet search history, which allegedly includes queries for "undetectable poisons" and how to obtain them, made from a work computer. The defense is expected to challenge the admissibility of this electronic evidence, arguing it was obtained beyond the scope of the search warrant. The case also involves allegations of an affair, with prosecutors claiming Craig was planning a new life with another woman.</p>

          <p>China's commercial space company, Space Pioneer, announced its Tianlong-3 rocket has passed a critical ground-based stress test. The test involved the rocket's nine-engine first stage and simulated key mission phases like lift-off, flight, and recovery, confirming the structural integrity of the vehicle. This successful test marks a significant milestone for the company, especially after a mishap in June of the previous year where the rocket unexpectedly lifted off and crashed during a static-fire test. The Tianlong-3 is designed for reuse and must withstand enormous stress during its operational cycle.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed the company's plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on constructing enormous AI data centers in the United States. The first of these, named Prometheus, is set to be operational in Ohio by 2026, with another multi-gigawatt cluster, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. Zuckerberg stated that one of the sites will cover an area nearly the size of Manhattan, underscoring the massive scale of Meta's investment in developing "superintelligence." This strategic push aims to position Meta at the forefront of the AI industry, though it raises concerns about the immense energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

The commission, led by Lord John Mann, highlighted an "onslaught of antisemitism" since October 7 and called for specific actions across various sectors. Key recommendations include the creation of a standardized antisemitism training qualification and a dedicated NHS summit to address what the report calls a "specific unaddressed issue" of antisemitism within the health service. The report also urges that Judaism be consistently recognized as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure appropriate handling of discrimination.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its potential liability in the 2019 death of Naibel Benavides, who was struck by a Model S operating on Autopilot in Florida. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver-assistance feature failed to warn the driver or apply the brakes before the high-speed collision. Tesla contends that the driver, who was reportedly distracted by a dropped cell phone, is solely responsible for the crash. The trial is significant as most past cases against the company have been settled or dismissed, and it will scrutinize the safety and marketing of Tesla's autonomous driving technology.</p>

The effort to pressure these nations is seen by some mainland Chinese analysts as part of a strategy to amplify the "China threat" and encourage increased defense spending and military cooperation. This diplomatic push is consistent with the Trump administration's maximum pressure approach.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement. The move is intended to protect U.S. tomato farmers from what the Commerce Department calls unfair trade practices and artificially low prices from Mexican producers.

However, critics, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and lawmakers from border states, warn that the tariff could lead to higher consumer prices for products like salsa, disrupt supply chains, and risk retaliatory actions from Mexico.

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans. The ruling provides a one-week administrative stay, preventing the revocation of deportation protections and work permits that were scheduled to end. The administration argues that conditions in Afghanistan have improved, while immigrant advocacy groups contend the country remains unsafe. This legal pause allows time for further court filings in a lawsuit that challenges the termination, providing what one nonprofit called a "brief but critical window of relief" for the approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program.</p>

Researchers found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were emitting ultrasonic distress sounds, suggesting the moths could perceive the plants as unhealthy. While plants are not sentient, they produce these sounds through physical processes when under stress, such as dehydration. This discovery opens up new fields of research into how various animals might use plant sounds to make decisions about pollination, feeding, or seeking shelter.</p>

          <p>The future of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is uncertain following a contentious meeting with Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a former rightwing podcaster and a controversial appointee, reportedly stormed out of the meeting and is considering resignation. The dispute stems from the fallout over a Justice Department memo that concluded Epstein's death was a suicide and that a rumored high-profile client list did not exist, contradicting theories previously pushed by both Bongino and Bondi. The public squabbling has created a rift within the MAGA movement and put Bongino's position in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking scheme. Maxwell's lawyers argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to the district of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary. Attorneys for Maxwell's victims praised the DOJ's move, stating she does not deserve protection and should remain imprisoned for her crimes.</p>

          <p>Following a period of intense heat and prolonged low rainfall, more regions in England are expected to be officially declared as being in a drought. The National Drought Group is meeting to assess the situation, with central and southern England likely to join the North West and Yorkshire, which are already under drought status. England experienced its driest spring in over a century, and the subsequent heatwaves have further depleted water levels in reservoirs and rivers. A drought declaration enables water companies to implement their management plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans to conserve resources.</p>

Emergency crews have been deployed to clear roads and have rescued nearly 80 people from the rising waters in Durham County alone.

Port executives attribute this surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as shippers rushed to import goods, particularly from China, ahead of President Trump's looming tariff deadlines. While the increase provided a short-term boost, officials anticipate a significant drop in cargo volume in the coming months once new tariffs are in place. The situation highlights the uncertainty and disruption caused by the ongoing trade disputes, forcing businesses to navigate volatile supply chains and rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>
