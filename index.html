          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a 2020 mortgage application. The indictment, secured by a U.S. attorney appointed by President Trump, alleges she misrepresented a property as a second home to obtain a better loan rate. James and her supporters have characterized the prosecution as politically motivated retribution for her legal actions against Trump. A trial date has been set for January 26, and her legal team is challenging the legitimacy of the prosecutor's appointment.</p>

The removal follows his decision to stop using his royal titles as scrutiny intensifies over sexual assault allegations, which he denies, and other financial dealings. This action symbolizes his further separation from official royal duties and public life. The prince faces additional pressure regarding his formal titles and his residence at Royal Lodge.</p>

          <p>Officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a police line outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned, but later canceled, immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. According to the Coast Guard, the driver failed to comply with commands to stop, posing a direct threat to personnel. The driver was reportedly wounded, and two civilians were also injured in the chaotic scene which followed hours of standoff.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown extends into its 24th day, essential federal workers are continuing to report to their jobs without receiving pay, causing significant financial distress. Employees are being forced to cancel appointments, delay necessary home repairs, and contact lenders for payment deferrals to stay afloat. The situation has led some long-term government employees to reconsider their careers in public service, citing the growing instability. Unlike furloughed workers, these essential employees are ineligible for unemployment benefits, compounding their economic anxiety.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.3% in September, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.0%, a figure slightly below economists' expectations. This report, one of the few economic data releases permitted during the government shutdown, was driven largely by a jump in gasoline prices, while core inflation remained more subdued. The softer-than-expected inflation data has reinforced market expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with another interest rate cut. The data provides a crucial, albeit limited, snapshot of the economy amidst the ongoing data blackout. (not investment advice)</p>

This move escalates trade tensions between the two closely linked economic partners, which have been strained by recent tariff disputes.</p>

          <p>A viral social media graphic claiming the UK has an exceptionally high rate of sexual assault compared to other European nations is highly misleading, according to a fact-check analysis. While the numbers used are technically accurate, experts warn that such cross-national comparisons are flawed due to vast differences in legal definitions, crime reporting practices, and cultural factors affecting victims' willingness to come forward. For instance, the UK's consent-based laws and methods for counting offenses can inflate its numbers relative to countries with narrower definitions. Criminologists suggest victim surveys provide a more accurate measure of prevalence than police-reported crime statistics.</p>

          <p>English Championship football club Sheffield Wednesday has been placed into administration, resulting in an automatic 12-point penalty that leaves them at the bottom of the league table. The move effectively ends the controversial tenure of owner Dejphon Chansiri, whose leadership was marked by financial mismanagement and fan protests. While administration presents immediate challenges, including a difficult fight against relegation, it is viewed with "bittersweet" relief by supporters. Fan groups are now exploring a potential supporter-led takeover as administrators seek new ownership for the historic club.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has strongly condemned the U.S. military's recent strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats, labeling the actions as illegal, ineffective, and a violation of international law.

President Petro stated his government receives no advance warning of the strikes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there is no fixed minimum amount that will trigger a lawsuit from a debt collector, legal action becomes more likely for debts ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. The decision to sue depends on factors like the size of the debt versus the cost of litigation, the type of debt, and state-specific laws governing small claims courts. Ignoring collection attempts increases the risk of being sued even for smaller balances. To avoid court, experts advise communicating with creditors, exploring debt management or settlement programs, or consolidating debt before the situation escalates to a lawsuit.</p>

One of the forgeries was a copy of Rembrandt's famous "De Staalmeesters," the original of which hangs in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.

His approval ratings have fallen amid corruption allegations and the harsh economic impact of his policies.

          <p>In an introduction to a new edition of Mary Shelley's classic novel, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro reflects on the profound impact "Frankenstein" had on him as a child. He argues that horror stories serve a spiritual purpose, allowing society to confront its deepest anxieties and internal conflicts in a safe, metaphorical space. Del Toro sees the novel as a powerful parable about abandonment, the arrogance of creation, and the tragedy of an existence without purpose, a story that requires no true villain. He connects its themes of lonely, wandering creations to his own recent films, "Pinocchio" and his upcoming "Frankenstein."</p>

          <p>A new study of ancient DNA extracted from the teeth of soldiers in Napoleon's Grande Armée has identified two additional diseases that likely contributed to its disastrous 1812 retreat from Russia. Scientists found genetic evidence of bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever in remains from a mass grave in Lithuania. These findings add to previously identified pathogens like typhus and trench fever, painting a grim picture of soldiers under a multi-front microbial assault.
