          <p>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators at Columbia University occupied Butler Library, leading to clashes with public safety officers and ultimately, intervention by the NYPD. Two public safety officers were injured during a crowd surge as individuals attempted to enter the library, and a fire alarm was activated during the protest. Acting University President Claire Shipman requested NYPD assistance to secure the building, citing safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliated individuals. The protests disrupted academic activities during the pre-final exams reading week, prompting disciplinary consequences for those found in violation of university rules. This incident follows previous Trump administration scrutiny and threats to withhold federal funding due to concerns about the protection of Jewish students on campus.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an upcoming 'major trade deal' with a 'big, and highly respected, country,' while also addressing foreign policy matters.

Trump also mentioned that news of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal proposal between Israel and Hamas could emerge within the next 24 hours. On Capitol Hill, Republicans are working to finalize legislation that encompasses Trump's broader legislative agenda, and key officials testified before various committees.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied Butler Library at Columbia University, renaming it ‚Äúthe Basel Al-Araj Popular University,‚Äù leading to a standoff with security and eventually the NYPD. Acting President Claire Shipman cited safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliates as reasons for requesting police intervention, marking the first such action since April 2024. The Trump administration has been critical of Columbia's handling of campus antisemitism, cutting federal research funding. The demonstrators faced potential disciplinary action, and the situation threatened ongoing negotiations for the restoration of federal funding, as the protest disrupted students studying for finals. About 70 demonstrators were taken into custody, and the police stated that charges were pending.</p>

The Trump administration has used this program to downsize the federal workforce, but the need to refill positions quickly has raised questions. Rollins acknowledged potential mistakes but insisted key roles were not included in the second round of buyouts, though this contradicts accounts from some employees.

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags as a workaround to Republican-led bans on flying 'unofficial flags' on government property. Salt Lake City approved three new city flags incorporating the pride flag, trans flag, and Juneteenth flag into the city's traditional design. Boise's mayor, Lauren McLean, issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag, responding to Idaho‚Äôs House Bill 96. The move aims to uphold values of diversity, equity, and inclusion amid increasing restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights at the state level.</p>

          <p>For the second time in just over a week, a U.S. fighter jet assigned to the USS Harry S. Truman has been lost in the Red Sea. The latest incident occurred when an arrestment failed during landing, causing the Super Hornet to go overboard, but both pilots safely ejected with minor injuries. This follows a previous incident on April 28 where a Super Hornet was lost after crews lost control while towing it in the hangar bay. The Truman Carrier Strike Group has experienced several incidents since deploying in September 2024.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares climbed following the Trump administration's plan to rescind the 'AI diffusion rule,' which would have restricted exports of advanced AI chips. The Commerce Department stated the rule was overly complex and would stifle American innovation, intending to replace it with a simpler rule. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang expressing concern about being locked out of the Chinese AI market. AMD CEO Lisa Su advocated for balancing national security with boosting the American chip industry.</p>
