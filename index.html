        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car production fell to its lowest level for May since 1949, dropping by nearly a third from the previous year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The decline is attributed to US tariffs which halved exports to the country, forcing some manufacturers to halt shipments. Production was also impacted by factory retooling for electric vehicles, but the industry group expressed optimism for a future recovery, citing a new US-UK deal that will reduce the tariffs.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez held a multi-day, multi-million-dollar wedding celebration in Venice, attended by numerous high-profile guests.

          <p>Anna Wintour, the iconic editor-in-chief of US Vogue, is stepping back from the magazine's day-to-day operations after nearly four decades at the helm. This article reflects on her immense and formidable influence on global fashion, her role in transforming the Met Gala into a major celebrity event, and the controversies that have marked her tenure.

          <p>The Council of Europe and the Ukrainian government have signed an agreement to create a special tribunal focused on the "crime of aggression" committed by Russia's leadership. This new body, likely to be based in The Hague, is designed to close a legal loophole, as the International Criminal Court currently cannot prosecute Russian officials, including potentially President Putin, for the decision to wage war itself. While a trial in person is considered highly unlikely, the tribunal is a significant step toward gathering evidence and establishing legal accountability.</p>

Ahead of the Euro 2025 tournament, she discusses how she leverages hyperfocus on the pitch but faces significant challenges with sensory overstimulation and social interactions in daily life. By speaking openly, Middleton-Patel hopes to foster greater public understanding of neurodivergence and to show how people with autism perceive and navigate the world differently.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first year in government, which has been marked by significant turmoil despite a landslide election victory. The new Labour government's honeymoon period was short, quickly beset by domestic crises, internal party tensions, and public backlash over unpopular policies like winter fuel payment cuts. While Starmer has been praised for his handling of foreign policy, he faces a profound challenge in regaining domestic momentum and public trust.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has executed a major U-turn on its controversial welfare reform plans following a massive and well-organized rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The capitulation is seen as a humiliating blow to the Prime Minister's authority less than a year into his term with a large majority. This reversal on a key economic policy has created uncertainty for the Treasury's financial projections and has left a lasting impression of weakness on the new government.</p>
