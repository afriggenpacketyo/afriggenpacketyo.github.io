          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel conducted airstrikes in Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and research scientists, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu described the operation, named "Operation Rising Lion," as a military effort to diminish the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, stating that the strikes would persist until the threat is eliminated. Iranian state television reported the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Hossein Salami in the attacks. The United States was not involved in the operation, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that protecting American forces in the region is the top priority, adding that Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.</p>

China has quickly built advanced transportation systems, including subways and high-speed rail, in a fraction of the time it took the United States to develop similar systems. The country excels in civil, electrical, nano-, computer, solar, and space engineering, all considered matters of national security. China produces significantly more STEM graduates than the U.S., and most of its top officials are engineers, contrasting with the U.S., where lawyers often hold such positions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's federalization of parts of the California National Guard was illegal and ordered him to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed the order briefly to allow the Trump administration to appeal, which they promptly did. Trump had federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard and mobilized 700 U.S. Marines to respond to protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's federalization of the Guard, arguing it was done without the governor's consent, marking the first time a president had taken such an action.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize members of the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, granting their request to block his use of the forces to assist immigration agents during raids. Breyer stated that Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service, failing to follow procedural requirements laid out by Congress. The Justice Department swiftly notified the court that it is appealing the order.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily ruled against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president erred in activating the guard. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom. District Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts lack authority to review a president's decision on National Guard deployment. Trump had deployed 4,000 California National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over the objections of Governor Newsom, citing attempts to impede immigration agents as a form of rebellion.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially earlier than previously believed. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The study found that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, indicating a domestication process alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, now part of the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion as a key strategy for long-term survival amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war between the US and China, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with significant planned capacity expansion in the Middle East and Africa. Executives at the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai emphasized that localizing production abroad is essential due to the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they describe as unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing the workers announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor, granting their leaders authority to call a strike. A walkout would significantly disrupt two of the nation’s largest grocery chains during the peak season. Negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies began months ago, with the workers’ contracts expiring in March, and are set to resume on June 25.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the U.S. government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings that it could be costly and disruptive. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts currently divided among multiple agencies and departments. Trump's proposed budget calls for creating a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department, shifting thousands of personnel from the Forest Service. Critics warn that the restructuring could increase the risk of catastrophic fires and disrupt ongoing firefighting efforts during peak fire season, while the order does not mention climate change.</p>

          <p>Israel launched an attack on Iran's capital early Friday, with explosions heard across Tehran as Israel targeted nuclear and military sites. Iranian state television reported the head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is feared dead, along with other top officials and nuclear scientists. The attack comes amid rising tensions over Iran's nuclear program, and the International Atomic Energy Agency recently censured Iran for not working with its inspectors. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the attacks will continue until the threat is removed, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took unilateral action and warned Iran not to target U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the British electronic industrial group Nitzer Ebb, has died at the age of 58. McCarthy founded Nitzer Ebb in Essex with David Gooday and Bon Harris, releasing their first single in 1985. The band's harsh, antagonistic style, known as EBM (electronic body music), influenced the industrial wave, anticipating acts like Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. McCarthy revived Nitzer Ebb in 2007 and released the album “Industrial Complex” in 2010, and he also released a solo album in 2012. McCarthy had been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and had stopped drinking for more than two years.</p>

          <p>A "Trojan horse" therapy, which delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, is being made available on the NHS in England, marking a world first. The therapy, belantamab mafodotin, can halt the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments. The drug binds to cancerous plasma cells and releases a toxic payload to kill the cancer, offering a more targeted approach with reduced side effects. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies, benefiting around 1,500 patients a year.</p>

Another couple, Mark and Sandra Thompson, faced significant site fee increases and were forced to sell their caravan for far less than its market value.

Critics argue that this remaking of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) undermines the scientific consensus on vaccination and erodes trust in immunization.

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Donald Trump's proposed megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest Americans. The CBO estimates that the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households would experience a 3.9% income cut, equivalent to about $1,600 per year. In contrast, households in the top 10% would see income gains of approximately $12,000 per year. The analysis highlights the potential for the bill to exacerbate income inequality in the United States.</p>

Koizumi's actions are reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Koizumi, the 44-year-old son of the former Prime Minister, has taken a series of steps to address the issue including releasing government stockpiled rice at about half the market value through direct contracts with retailers. Koizumi's resurgence comes as the LDP faces an upcoming election with a public frustrated by rising prices.</p>
