          <p>Renowned New York City restaurateur Keith McNally has released a new memoir titled "I Regret Almost Everything," in which he candidly discusses his life, career, and personal struggles. Following a debilitating stroke in 2016 that impaired his speech and mobility, McNally faced a period of deep depression, which he details in the book. The article also covers his use of social media as a new outlet for communication, leading to public controversies such as his widely publicized dispute with former late-night host James Corden. McNally reflects on his working-class London upbringing and his journey to becoming a central figure in New York's dining scene.</p>

          <p>England defender Jess Carter has announced she is taking a break from social media after receiving a significant amount of racial abuse during the Euro 2025 tournament. The 27-year-old stated that while fans are entitled to opinions on performance, it is unacceptable to target someone's race or appearance. In a related move, the Lionesses team announced they would no longer take a knee before matches, stating a need for new methods to combat racism. The Football Association has confirmed it is collaborating with police to identify and prosecute those responsible for the hate crime.</p>

          <p>Increasing volcanic and seismic activity is raising concerns for the half a million people living within the Campi Flegrei, a massive volcanic caldera near Naples, Italy. The area, which experienced around two thousand earthquakes in February alone, sits just west of Mount Vesuvius and stretches for 125 miles under densely populated urban areas. Scientists are closely monitoring the situation as the ground continues to shift and deform due to underground magma movements. The ongoing activity places the residents of this volcanic "red zone" on high alert for a potential eruption and subsequent evacuation.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett is intensifying his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the late financier and accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While advocating for transparency, Burchett emphasized the need to protect the identities of victims and any innocent individuals mentioned in the files. He pushed back against former President Trump's initial dismissal of the effort as a hoax but acknowledged Trump's subsequent directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive first step. Burchett expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, citing Washington's secretive nature.</p>

          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game warm-ups, players, including sidelined star Caitlin Clark, wore T-shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight their demands in ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations. The players argue that the league's booming business, evidenced by a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, justifies increased salaries. Despite the public protest, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a new, transformative agreement will be reached before the current CBA expires on October 31.

          <p>New research in personality science suggests that individuals can intentionally redesign their personality traits through conscious effort and behavioral changes. This article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who, frustrated with her anxiety and neuroticism, undertook a year-long project to become more extroverted and calm. According to psychologists, by repeatedly acting against one's natural tendencies—such as an introvert forcing themselves into social situations like improv classes—it is possible to shift ingrained personality characteristics. This approach, which involves adopting desired behaviors until they feel natural, offers a new perspective on mental health and personal growth.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. Army bases, an action that circumvents a 2021 law. Hegseth claims he is renaming the bases after different historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes, a move critics call a transparent game. The House Armed Services Committee recently voted to block this effort, reflecting congressional anger over the flouting of established law.

The piece explores the state's foundational contradictions, from the mythologizing of rule-breaking "Sooners" to the forgotten dream of an all-Black state envisioned by Edward McCabe. It argues that Oklahoma has always been a testing ground for America's conflicting impulses of reinvention, ambition, racial violence, and erasure, which continue to shape national politics today.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The decline is linked to perceptions that the program is not focused on dangerous criminals and is targeting Hispanic people unfairly, leading to a drop in the president's approval among Hispanic Americans. The poll also indicates that a majority of Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. The recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is widely seen as primarily benefiting the wealthy.</p>

Recent actions include gutting tax credits for wind and solar projects and proposing the closure of 10 NOAA labs that research climate change.

The evacuation call also raises fears for the families of Israeli hostages, as it is suspected that Hamas may be holding captives in the city.

          <p>A tsunami threat for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been canceled after a series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck in the nearby sea. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the main quake occurred at a depth of 20 kilometers, east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a warning for potential major waves but later downgraded and then lifted it. A separate tsunami watch for Hawaii was also ended. There have been no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic activity.</p>

          <p>A performance of the opera Il trovatore at London's Royal Opera House concluded with a political protest during the Saturday night curtain call. A cast member unfurled a large Palestinian flag, prompting a brief scuffle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to remove it. The Royal Ballet and Opera issued a statement calling the unauthorized action "completely inappropriate" and reiterated its commitment to political impartiality. The incident, captured on video, shows the performer holding the flag for the remainder of the curtain call while other cast members continue to receive applause from the audience.</p>

          <p>This article explains the health risks associated with Vibrio bacteria, which thrive in warm, low-salinity coastal waters like the Baltic, North, and Black Seas. Climate change is exacerbating the problem by creating more favorable conditions, leading to a rise in vibriosis infections during summer heatwaves. Vibriosis can cause severe symptoms and is especially dangerous for individuals with weakened immune systems, sometimes leading to flesh-eating infections or death. To stay safe, health agencies advise against eating raw shellfish and recommend that people with open wounds avoid swimming in these waters, as the bacteria can cause serious blood infections.</p>

          <p>In response to recent conservative criticism of Superman being portrayed as an immigrant, this article delves into the character's historical roots as a leftist figure created by the sons of Jewish immigrants. Grant Morrison, author of the influential "All-Star Superman" series, explains that the original 1930s comics depicted Superman as a "champion of the oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums. The character's identity has evolved over the decades, reflecting the changing American culture—from a patriotic figure in WWII to a suburban family man in the 1950s. The analysis argues that Superman's enduring power lies in his ability to embody a universal, allegorical ideal.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused some council officials of deliberately obstructing the work of his party's newly elected councillors. After gaining control of 10 councils in May, Farage claims his representatives are being "hamstrung" by established bureaucracies that are resistant to change. He defended controversial spending decisions, such as hiring political assistants in Warwickshire, as necessary to overcome this obstructionism and implement the party's agenda of cutting wasteful spending. Opponents have criticized these moves, arguing the funds should be directed toward front-line services instead.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other buildings, sparking questions about the park's fire management strategy. The Dragon Bravo fire, initially a small, lightning-sparked blaze, was allowed to burn under a "control and contain" policy but exploded in size amid unexpectedly dry and windy conditions. Firefighters on the scene reported being underequipped and trapped by the rapidly advancing flames. The loss of the iconic lodge is a devastating blow to the community and raises concerns about the long-term environmental impact on the area's sole drinking water source.</p>

The National Science Foundation faces a proposed 56% budget cut, and the National Institutes of Health has already frozen thousands of grants. Scientists express fear over the loss of decades of data and expertise, which they say jeopardizes public health, safety, and the US position as a global scientific leader.</p>

Orthopedic surgeons report a dramatic increase in elbow ligament surgeries, like the Tommy John procedure, particularly among teenage athletes trying to secure scholarships and professional contracts. An MLB study confirmed that the push for higher velocity and maximum effort pitching are the most significant causes. While advanced training labs help pitchers throw harder, critics argue this comes at a high cost, likening the strain on young arms to child abuse.</p>

While most teens still prefer human interaction, a significant minority find AI conversations equally or more satisfying. The study raises concerns about the potential impact on adolescent social development, data privacy, and addictive behavior, as some teens share personal information and discuss serious matters with these platforms. The nonprofit recommends that no one under 18 use AI companions due to these risks and the platforms' design to capture attention and data.</p>

          <p>The imposition of high U.S. tariffs has devastated the garment industry in Lesotho, which had become a major apparel exporter under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The announcement of a 50 percent tariff has led to factory closures and widespread job losses, plunging many workers, particularly single mothers, into poverty. Lesotho's government has declared a national state of disaster, arguing the tariffs effectively nullify the benefits of AGOA and threaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands. The economic fallout highlights the severe impact of U.S. trade policy on the small, impoverished nation. (not investment advice)</p>
