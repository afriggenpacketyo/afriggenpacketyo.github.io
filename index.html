          <p>Despite President Trump being less than four months into his second term, several Democrats are already positioning themselves for a potential run in the 2028 presidential election. Figures like Pete Buttigieg, J.B. Pritzker, Wes Moore, and Andy Beshear are making early moves, including headlining events in key primary states. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also gaining attention through rallies with Bernie Sanders. Democrats are aiming to regain hope after recent election setbacks, with strategists suggesting that potential presidential candidates offer a way to look towards a future beyond Trump's administration. Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Ro Khanna, Stephen A. Smith, Mark Cuban, Roy Cooper, Michelle Lujan Grisham and Tim Walz are all potential contenders as well.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card balances at record highs and interest rates nearing 22%, experts suggest several debt relief strategies. Debt consolidation, particularly through HELOCs, is favored for its lower interest rates, while balance transfer cards can be effective for those with good credit who can quickly pay off debt. Debt management plans offer structured repayment with negotiated interest rates, but debt settlement, which involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than owed, can significantly harm credit scores. Experts emphasize the importance of financial planning, budgeting, and exploring debt payoff methods like the avalanche or snowball approach. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration has also disbanded a Justice Department unit focused on cryptocurrency crimes and suspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, is expected to testify in the federal racketeering and sex-trafficking case against Sean Combs, alleging a system of abuse and control over her life and career. Prosecutors claim Combs dangled music opportunities, beat her, and forced her into sexual encounters with prostitutes. Combs's lawyers portray the relationship as toxic but consensual. Ventura's lawsuit in 2023 led to multiple civil lawsuits and a criminal inquiry against Combs. The defense will aim to frame Ventura as a willing participant in a troubled relationship, but the prosecution will hope to portray her as a brave truth-teller.</p>

          <p>Thomas B. Edsall discusses how Donald Trump is exploiting his position for personal gain, attacks his adversaries to mask his own violations, and is radically altering the Republican Party’s moral guidelines to make self-enrichment a routine fact of political life. Experts suggest that Trump's base hails his brazen defiance and flouting of norms as signs that he alone can destroy a system rigged against them. The essay explores how Trump's shamelessness and unapologetic approach are seen as forms of confidence and strength by his supporters, despite his ethical lapses and legal challenges.</p>

Drafting Flagg would provide fans with a homegrown star to rally behind, offering a fresh start after recent mismanagement.
