          <p>Maureen McCormick, known for her role as Marcia Brady, recently celebrated her 40th wedding anniversary with husband Michael Cummings. The couple attributes their long-lasting Hollywood marriage to maintaining a sense of humor and not taking things too seriously. McCormick also highlighted the importance of celebrating their differences and noted it was refreshing that Cummings was unaware of her fame when they first met. The article also touches upon her past struggles with addiction and how her husband's support was crucial to her over 40 years of sobriety.</p>

          <p>In response to recent global concerns over aviation manufacturing quality, China has developed a futuristic assembly line for its C919 passenger jet. The system integrates 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect all tools, robots, and workers, creating a unified intelligent loop for sensing, transmission, and control. This advanced "smart factory" aims to eliminate manual oversight errors, such as missing bolts, by ensuring every component and action is monitored in real-time. The technology represents a significant step in automating and securing aircraft production processes.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely partners in the ongoing proposal to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations. Trump also mentioned that Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell are probably involved, describing the potential investors as "American patriots." The comments come as the administration continues to work out the final details of a deal to address national security concerns related to the popular video-sharing app. The specifics of the agreement between the U.S. and China remain under negotiation.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new rules for journalists, requiring them to sign an agreement not to disclose unauthorized information to maintain their access credentials. The restrictions, which also limit reporters' movement within the building, are aimed at preventing leaks of sensitive information. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated the press must "follow the rules — or go home," framing it as a security measure. The move has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and press organizations, who have labeled it an "assault on independent journalism."</p>

          <p>Nineteen ICE detainees held at a facility within Louisiana's state penitentiary, known as Angola, are on a hunger strike to protest inadequate living conditions. According to advocacy groups, the detainees are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, clean water, and basic hygiene products. The facility, formerly known as Camp J, was recently reopened by the Trump administration to house immigrant detainees. Activists argue that the conditions are unsafe and degrading, citing the prison's history of abuse and neglect.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is facing increasing pressure as his public support wanes amid economic challenges and growing perceptions of corruption. The author contends that key figures like Attorney General Pam Bondi must weigh the risks of carrying out legally questionable actions as the president's political standing deteriorates. Factors such as rising grocery prices, stalled job growth, and unpopular policies are contributing to a negative public mood, even among some Republicans. The piece concludes that Trump's efforts to consolidate power are a race against time before potential political repudiation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump traveled to Arizona to attend the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Before his departure, Trump praised Kirk as "a great man" who had a "tremendous influence" on young people, who he said loved and respected him. The president stated his intention was to provide comfort to Kirk's family and expressed disbelief that "something like this could have happened." The event is framed as a time for healing in the wake of Kirk's death, which has sparked a national conversation about political violence.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, French President Emmanuel Macron explained his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move he will announce at the United Nations. He argues that recognition is not a reward for Hamas but a necessary step to provide a political alternative for the Palestinian people and isolate the terrorist group. Macron outlined a multi-phase plan involving a ceasefire, hostage release, and a transitional governance structure for Gaza, asserting this approach will re-engage regional partners. He contends that a purely military strategy against Hamas has failed, as the group continues to recruit new members.</p>

Head coach Paula Dunn described the results as a "mixed bag" with "missed opportunities," citing challenging heat and humidity as factors.

          <p>According to well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. This cellular damage can be reversed by adopting lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle" and provide restorative breaks for the body's cells. Epel recommends simple, sustainable practices to lower stress, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short daily breaks or meditation, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga. These small adjustments, maintained over time, can help slow the rate of aging and improve overall health.</p>

          <p>Italy has successfully defended its Billie Jean King Cup title, defeating the United States 2-0 in the final held in Shenzhen. The victory was secured through singles wins by Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini, who delivered an inspired performance to clinch Italy's sixth championship in the premier women's team tennis competition. Paolini sealed the title with a straight-sets victory over Jessica Pegula, her first win against the American in six attempts. The win makes Italy the first nation to capture back-to-back titles since the Czech Republic's three-peat from 2014-2016.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a new mutual defense pact, strengthening a long-standing security partnership at a time of growing regional uncertainty. The agreement is seen as part of Riyadh's strategy to diversify its security alliances amid concerns about the reliability of the United States as its primary guarantor. For Saudi Arabia, the pact secures protection from Pakistan's formidable military. Analysts suggest this move signals an evolution in geopolitical alignments in the Gulf, influenced by US-China tensions and recent regional conflicts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card expert advises consumers to avoid common mistakes when using rewards cards, such as choosing no-annual-fee options and hoarding points. According to Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, cards with modest annual fees typically offer significantly better rewards that justify the cost for most spenders. He also warns against accumulating large point balances, as their value can be devalued by issuers at any time, recommending instead that users redeem them regularly. If a card's fee feels too high, he suggests calling the issuer to negotiate for retention offers before downgrading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of airline check-in and boarding software, has caused significant disruption at several European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The outage of the "MUSE" software, which began Saturday, forced airlines to use manual, paper-based check-in processes, leading to long delays and flight cancellations. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of Monday's flights as the provider has not yet delivered a secure, updated version of the system. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry's interconnected digital infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As several Western nations move to recognize a Palestinian state, a key challenge remains: identifying a unified and effective leadership to govern it. The Palestinian political landscape is deeply fractured, with the West Bank governed by the aging Palestinian Authority and Gaza formerly controlled by Hamas. There have been no national elections since 2006, and popular potential leaders like Marwan Barghouti remain imprisoned in Israel. This analysis explores the practical difficulties of statehood, including undefined territory and the lack of a functioning, unified government, which complicates the path forward.</p>

          <p>California's governor has signed a new law that will prohibit most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal ICE agents, from wearing face masks. The bill, which takes effect in 2026, was introduced in response to federal agents wearing masks during immigration raids in Los Angeles and is intended to prevent the use of "secret police." The law includes exceptions for specific situations like undercover operations or protection against disease. Federal officials have criticized the law as an attempt to endanger officers, while state proponents defend it as a necessary protection for civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Researchers analyzing the DNA of two 7,000-year-old mummies from the Takarkori rock shelter in Libya have discovered a unique genetic lineage previously unknown to science. The remains belong to female herders who lived during the "Green Sahara" period when the region was a humid savannah. Contrary to expectations, their ancestry is not closely related to Sub-Saharan populations but instead stems from a distinct North African group that remained largely isolated. This finding suggests that pastoralism and other cultural practices may have spread through the exchange of ideas rather than large-scale migrations.</p>

The spokesman emphasized that ceding any territory is "out of the question."

However, there are concerns that a detailed map could also accelerate deep-sea exploitation, such as mining for resources in largely unregulated international waters.

          <p>This article draws parallels between the role of women in historical fascist regimes, like Nazi Germany, and the current political climate in the U.S. under the Trump administration. It argues that strongman leaders often promote a "strict father" model of society, relying on women to uphold traditional domestic duties to ensure stability and incubate state ideology at home. The piece highlights the rise of the online "womanosphere," where influencers promote traditional homemaking, and connects this to policies that restrict reproductive rights and workplace equity. The author posits that this dynamic tasks women with absorbing the consequences of a shrinking social safety net.</p>
