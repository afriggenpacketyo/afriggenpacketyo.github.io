        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After weeks of escalating tensions following a militant attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan have engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, utilizing new tools of war like drones. Pakistan accused India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting several bases, followed by retaliatory actions targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage site. The conflict has led to civilian casualties and heightened fears among residents, with both sides mobilizing troops and suspending cricket leagues. Diplomatic efforts from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the United States and Europe have so far been unsuccessful in de-escalating the situation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 22:18:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, attracted by generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding for film. Last year, 65% of UK production spending came from major US film studios and streaming giants, amounting to £1.37 billion. The UK's Film Tax Relief offers a 25% tax rebate, making it cheaper to produce films like Jurassic World: Dominion, which saved Universal £89.1 million. While President Trump has suggested tariffs on movies made abroad, a federal tax incentive in the US could be a possible solution to keep productions stateside.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she will not be running in the upcoming Georgia Senate race against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, citing her unwillingness to fight for a Republican team that she believes refuses to win. Greene's decision came shortly after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp also decided against running for the Senate seat, leaving the primary field largely open. Republicans are aiming to unseat Ossoff to expand their majority in the Senate, but recent polling data showed Greene trailing significantly behind Ossoff, while Kemp had a closer hypothetical matchup.</p>

          <p>Ryan Michael English, a 24-year-old from Massachusetts, has been charged with attempting to assassinate a cabinet nominee, Scott Bessent, and carrying a dangerous weapon on U.S. Capitol grounds. English was arrested in January after allegedly trying to enter the Capitol with a knife and Molotov cocktails, also plotting to kill House Speaker Mike Johnson and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Prosecutors stated that English was inspired by United HealthCare CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione. English allegedly told a Capitol Police officer he was there to kill Scott Bessent and had also intended to burn down the Heritage Foundation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right to challenge detention in court, to address illegal immigration. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller argued the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts contend that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a presidential suspension would be unconstitutional. This consideration follows a similar rationale used to invoke the Alien Enemies Act for the deportation of alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which was previously struck down by federal judges.</p>

          <p>A new BBC drama, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, dramatizes the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent Scots-US investigation, revealing how flaws in the response to victims' families influenced protocols after 9/11. Kara Weipz, whose brother died in the bombing, noted that families learned of their loved ones' deaths through news reports, highlighting the need for improved notification systems. Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park emphasized the families' role in advocating for reforms, which led to strengthened travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening. The drama also portrays the compassion of Lockerbie residents who volunteered to help traumatized families, showcasing acts of connective humanity amidst the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The financial relationship between the United States and China is facing increasing strain due to declining mutual trust and escalating trade tensions. New regulations, such as the Outbound Investment Rule and the America First Investment Policy, impose restrictions on American investments in China-linked companies. These measures add complexity to fundraising efforts by Chinese firms in the US and Hong Kong. The threat of delisting from US exchanges looms large for nearly 300 Chinese firms, reflecting the broader decoupling trend driven by tariffs and geopolitical competition. Chen Zhiwu, a finance professor at the University of Hong Kong, emphasizes the vulnerability of financial relations in the absence of trust.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over allegations surrounding their 2024 film "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson stated that the subpoena is a publicity stunt to draw attention to the case, emphasizing Swift's limited involvement with the film, which only included permitting the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet." Lively sued Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment on set, while Baldoni countersued Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for defamation, seeking $400 million.

The most cited factor contributing to loneliness was the bereavement of a family member, followed by living alone and health issues.

While the exact landing location remains unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude.

          <p>A new study by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in China warns that the country's growing number of nuclear reactors could become prime targets in wartime, risking catastrophic consequences. China's nuclear power construction is booming, with over 100 commercial reactors operational or under construction, primarily along the coast. The study, spurred by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, calls for enhanced defenses and emergency response strategies to protect these facilities. The project team, led by associate professor Wang Fengshan, argues that nuclear plants would inevitably become high-value targets for adversaries in war or terrorist attacks.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams's previously dropped federal corruption case. The mayor's office stated the purpose of the visit was to discuss New York City priorities, including infrastructure needs. Trump suggested Adams came to thank him, while Adams initially made no mention of gratitude. The released documents shed light on the FBI's investigation into potential witness tampering by Adams, though he was never charged. The meeting occurs as the city addresses issues involving the Trump administration.</p>

The statement comes before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The two nations have been in a tense standoff since Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliation from China. Analysts suggest investors expect a resolution to the trade war and anticipate tariffs could be cut further following negotiations.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians and artists are urging the UK Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, requiring AI developers to be transparent about using copyrighted material to train AI models. The artists argue that failing to protect their work would effectively give it away to tech firms and threaten the UK's creative industries. The proposed amendment, championed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, aims to facilitate licensing agreements between creators and companies. Concerns have been mounting over the inclusion of copyrighted works in the data used to develop generative AI systems.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels from May through October due to the presence of naturally occurring toxins. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be fatal to humans. The quarantine covers the entire California coastline, and there are no known antidotes for these toxins. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to frequent testing. Symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning include tingling of the lips and tongue, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis.</p>
