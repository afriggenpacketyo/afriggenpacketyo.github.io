          <p>The dollar has experienced a sharp decline, falling below the 140 yen level for the first time in seven months, according to Kyodo News. This marks a significant shift in the currency market, reflecting potential changes in economic conditions or investor sentiment. The drop in the dollar's value against the yen could have implications for trade, investment, and monetary policy between the United States and Japan, as well as broader global financial markets. This could also affect the relative purchasing power of consumers and businesses in both countries, and the profitability of exporters and importers. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal status of 133 international students whose visas were allegedly unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, claims that ICE abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively making the students deportable. Many of the students faced minor charges that were later dropped, while some had no charges at all. The judge sided with the students, rejecting the government's argument that granting relief would affect its control over immigration and set a hearing for Thursday.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 01:28:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a sharp decline after President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's criticism comes amid concerns that his own tariff policies are driving a stock market sell-off and raising fears of an economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, and the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022, while gold hit a new record high as investors sought safe-haven assets. This situation underscores the tension between the executive branch and the independent central bank and the potential impact on market stability.</p>

          <p>China's CATL, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries, announced a new battery that it claims can add 323 miles of driving range with just five minutes of charging, surpassing BYD's recently announced fast-charging system. CATL also revealed new sodium-ion batteries within its "Naxtra" series, reducing the EV industry's reliance on lithium. The company claims its new Shenxing battery is the world's first lithium iron phosphate battery with both an 800 km range and a 12C peak charging rate. These advancements could address consumer concerns about EV range and convenience, potentially accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn are finally set to face off in the boxing ring, reigniting a rivalry that began with their fathers' iconic fights in the early 1990s.

Eubank has expressed his desire for "revenge" and to "make Benn pay," while Benn predicts "a one-sided beat-down." This highly anticipated match is steeped in history, hatred, and hostility, making it one of the most intriguing fights in recent memory.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt a freeze on over $2.2 billion in grants, arguing that the administration's demands to limit activism on campus infringe on its First Amendment rights. The administration had called for reforms at Harvard, including changes to admissions policies and an audit of diversity viewpoints, following campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the university would not bend to these demands, leading to the funding freeze. The lawsuit frames the government's actions as a threat to the autonomy of American universities.</p>

          <p>For individuals with ADHD, accurately perceiving and managing time, often referred to as "time blindness," can pose significant challenges at work. This neurological condition impacts executive functions, making it difficult to estimate how long tasks will take, adhere to schedules, and prioritize activities. Time blindness can lead to tardiness, overcommitting, and difficulty focusing. Underlying differences in brain structure and neurotransmitter activity are thought to contribute to this condition, making tasks related to time management particularly difficult.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing a mix of relief and concern for central banks globally, as appreciating local currencies impact export competitiveness and debt burdens. While a weaker dollar can ease inflation and allow for rate cuts, it also complicates export competitiveness, particularly in Asia, where renewed U.S. tariffs add to the challenge. Some emerging markets may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks such as capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration. For now, most central banks are avoiding a currency war, focusing on managing inflation and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 100 presidents of US colleges and universities have signed a statement denouncing the Trump administration’s “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in higher education. The statement, published by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, comes after the administration has threatened funding cuts and demanded significant institutional autonomy from several universities. The signatories, including presidents of Harvard, Princeton, and Brown, call for "constructive engagement" but oppose undue government intrusion in campus life. This unified front marks a strong response to the administration's campaign against higher education.</p>

The tri-engine, tailless flying-wing aircraft, unofficially dubbed the J-36, is expected to have unprecedented stealth capabilities and long-range strike capabilities. A research paper indicated that the J-36 design team is in the early stages of creating a naval variant suitable for the PLA Navy's growing fleet of aircraft carriers.

          <p>President Trump has issued dual endorsements in the Republican primary for Arizona governor, backing both U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson. This unusual move comes after some of Trump's allies expressed concerns about Robson's ties to the Republican establishment.

Robson, who previously aligned with more traditional conservatives, has been working to align herself with Trump's agenda.

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on open trade between China and the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariff policies. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods and the elimination of the de minimis exemption are putting pressure on these businesses, leading to decreased revenue and increased costs. Many dropshippers are hiking prices, shifting focus to the European market, and facing delays as products are stopped at the border for inspection. The situation has created turbulence in China's cross-border e-commerce sector, with many small and medium-sized enterprises facing difficulties in exporting.</p>
