          <p>Japan has started selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move seeks to address public criticism of the government's ineffectiveness in curbing rising rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency and speed required to alleviate public concerns and prevent a shift away from rice consumption, with a special response team established to handle high rice price issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of legislation, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sales price from the factory to a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While complex, the rule can provide significant cost savings, especially for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, as noted by Moncler. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep helps the brain clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. The team discovered that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough offers insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.</p>

          <h2>Tripadvisor Reports Increase in Fake Reviews Detected in 2024</h2>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection system. The company's process relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, with paid reviews being a smaller but more pernicious category.</p>

          <p>At least 24 Palestinians have been killed in two separate Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, including an attack on a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City. Twenty bodies, including those of children, were recovered from the school after fires engulfed classrooms. Shortly before the school strike, another Israeli air strike hit a home in central Gaza City, killing four more people. The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week.</p>

          <p>Tesla is encountering difficulties in selling its new and improved Model Y, with reports indicating that these vehicles are sitting untouched on lots nationwide. Despite being a highly anticipated debut, there is little to no wait time for the Model Y, and Tesla is offering 0% financing on them. Analysts suggest that these incentives indicate a demand problem, especially given the company's already low margins. Tesla's slumping sales are significant as the margin between its sales numbers and those of its competitors is shrinking, with increased competition and company-specific issues contributing to the challenges.</p>

While many Americans view pennies as a nuisance, they still hold monetary value. Coinstar CEO Kevin McColly suggests that the average household has $60 to $90 in neglected coins, which can be converted into spendable cash. Instead of treating coins as clutter, they should be seen as recyclables, contributing to the monetary system and reducing the need for new coin production. (not investment advice)</p>
