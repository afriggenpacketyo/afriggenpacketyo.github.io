          <p>The process of selecting a jury for a federal civil trial over a fatal 2019 Tesla crash has underscored the challenge of finding impartial jurors due to strong public opinions about CEO Elon Musk. The lawsuit, filed by the family of a deceased pedestrian, alleges that Tesla's Autopilot feature was defective and unsafe, while Tesla's defense argues the crash was caused by a distracted driver. This case is one of over a dozen similar lawsuits against the company concerning its automated driving systems, with the trial focusing on shared responsibility for the incident.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. Despite a year-over-year decline in net income due to a prior-year gain, the bank's core operations showed resilience. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the strong results but also reiterated warnings about persistent economic risks, including trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions, while boosting the bank's net interest income guidance for the year.

          <p>The U.S. House is set to vote on two significant pieces of cryptocurrency legislation, including a stablecoin bill and the broader CLARITY Act, which aims to define regulatory oversight between the SEC and CFTC. While the industry is lobbying heavily for the bills, passage in the Senate is uncertain due to concerns from some Democrats about potential conflicts of interest related to the Trump family's extensive crypto-related ventures. A separate bill to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency is also expected to pass the House.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has successfully negotiated a trade deal with Indonesia, though he did not provide any specific details of the agreement. The announcement, made via a post on Truth Social, follows a recent letter in which Trump had threatened the Southeast Asian nation with a 32% tariff rate if a deal was not reached by August 1. This agreement marks the fourth such deal secured by the Trump administration since launching its aggressive tariff policy, following previous agreements with China, the UK, and Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Following England's driest start to a year since 1976, the Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands, joining other regions already under the same status. The declaration signals that water companies may need to implement restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, to manage dwindling water supplies in rivers and reservoirs. While the drought is driven by natural weather patterns, officials note that climate change and growing water consumption are increasing the risk and severity of such shortages, impacting agriculture and natural ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, mortgage rates remain elevated, with the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovering around 6.70% as of mid-July. This challenging environment is a direct result of the Federal Reserve's policies to combat inflation, which have made borrowing more expensive. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise borrowers to strengthen their credit profiles, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders, as even small differences in rates can lead to significant savings.

          <p>As they face sentencing, a closer look at Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, the men who cut down the beloved Sycamore Gap tree, suggests a craving for attention may have been a key motive. Graham, a groundworks operator, and Carruthers, his friend and employee, exchanged messages after the felling, marveling at the worldwide media attention their act of vandalism received. Experts in criminology and psychology speculate that the men derived a sense of power and perverted pleasure from the global outrage and grief they caused, turning an act of destruction into a bid for notoriety.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed it secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans to the UK after a 2022 Ministry of Defence data breach inadvertently leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 people who had applied for resettlement. The existence of the breach and the subsequent £400 million relocation program were concealed for years under a superinjunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted. The leak, which occurred when a spreadsheet was emailed improperly, contained sensitive information that could have put individuals at risk from the Taliban, prompting an apology from the Defence Secretary.</p>

The law increases the tax rate on endowments for many universities, which could impact top research institutions, while also altering how charitable deductions are calculated for both everyday givers and the wealthy. While aimed at encouraging more giving from average Americans, critics worry the new limits on deductions for top earners could disincentivize large-scale philanthropy, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates the overall bill will add trillions to the national deficit.

The ruling establishes a precedent for future cases but determined that in this instance, the US had taken sufficient measures to target legitimate military objectives.</p>
