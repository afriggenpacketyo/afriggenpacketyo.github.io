          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old, as the suspect in a deadly car blast that targeted a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, and believe he is the sole fatality in the incident. The FBI said they believe he detonated explosives outside the clinic and tried to livestream the attack, and that the suspect used a 2010 silver Ford Fusion sedan in the attack. The FBI is still looking for the public's help to piece together the suspect's whereabouts before the blast, and will remain on scene for the next day or two to continue their investigation. </p>
