          <p>Immunologists explain that "freshers' flu" is not a single illness but an assortment of common cold viruses that spread rapidly as students from diverse locations gather in close quarters at the start of university. Factors like stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, and alcohol consumption weaken students' immune systems, making them more susceptible to these infections. While the illness is rarely serious, experts advise that the combination of new viral exposures and lifestyle pressures can make symptoms feel more severe than a typical cold, emphasizing the importance of rest for recovery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by President Biden, Deborah Boardman, has sentenced Nicholas Roske to eight years in prison for the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022. The sentence has drawn criticism from conservative figures who argue it is too lenient, especially compared to the 30 years sought by the Department of Justice. Judge Boardman cited mitigating factors, including Roske's cooperation with police, while Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced that the DOJ will appeal the decision.</p>

The deployment escalates existing tensions between federal and local leaders over immigration enforcement tactics, which have recently included controversial ICE raids and the alleged use of chemical agents against civilians.</p>

          <p>In Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, anti-government protesters clashed with police who used water cannons and pepper spray to prevent them from storming the presidential palace. The demonstration is part of an ongoing political crisis following a disputed parliamentary election won by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has since paused talks on joining the European Union. Protesters, who accuse the government of being pro-Russian, are demanding the release of jailed opposition leaders and snap elections amid a government crackdown on activists and media.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from keeping unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The ruling halts a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initiative that would have transferred these young adults to adult detention centers instead of releasing them to less restrictive settings as previously mandated by a 2021 court order. This decision comes amid broader criticism of the administration's immigration policies, including accusations of reviving family separations to pressure migrants.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. A former minister with a reputation for staunch conservative views, including opposition to same-sex marriage, she has recently softened her tone on some domestic issues to appeal to a wider base. Inspired by Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi has pledged to revive "Abenomics" and has called for easing constitutional restrictions on Japan's military.</p>

          <p>Iran has executed six men who were accused of conducting bombings and killing security forces in the southwestern Khuzestan province, alleging the attacks were carried out for Israel. The executions are part of a broader wave of capital punishment in the country, which has seen a significant increase in 2025. Human rights organizations report that the executed men were Arab political prisoners who were subjected to torture and forced into televised confessions, highlighting ongoing concerns about the fairness of Iran's judicial process, especially in politically charged cases.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic candidate for Virginia's attorney general, is facing bipartisan condemnation after 2022 text messages surfaced in which he used violent and inflammatory language about his Republican opponents. In the messages, Jones wrote about hypothetically shooting a Republican legislative leader, Todd Gilbert, twice in the head. Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and embarrassment for his words, while his own party's gubernatorial nominee, Abigail Spanberger, has expressed her "disgust" with the comments.</p>

          <p>Goalkeeper Senne Lammens made his debut for Manchester United in a victory against Sunderland, earning a clean sheet and praise from fans who have been desperate for a reliable alternative in goal. The 23-year-old Belgian made two key saves, demonstrating a confidence that has been lacking, though an ill-advised rush from his goal showed he still has areas to improve. Manager Ruben Amorim explained he delayed Lammens's debut to allow him to adapt to the pressure at the club, but his performance provided a much-needed positive for the team.</p>

This balancing act allows Turkey to maintain its energy security while also managing its complex geopolitical relationships with both Russia and Western allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Jack Daniel's distillery in Tennessee is ending its decades-long practice of providing spent grain, a byproduct of whiskey production, to local cattle farmers for free, a decision that farmers say could destroy their businesses. The company is instead partnering with a third-party firm to convert the waste into renewable natural gas to meet global sustainability goals. This move highlights a growing tension between corporate environmental objectives and the economic survival of local communities that have long-standing, symbiotic relationships with major brands.</p>

Red Bull's Max Verstappen stated he will not use the vest, criticizing its design and arguing its use should be a driver's personal choice, not a mandatory safety measure. In contrast, Mercedes driver George Russell plans to use the system, noting his team has made other improvements to reduce cockpit temperatures, while McLaren's Oscar Piastri remained undecided due to concerns about the system potentially failing.</p>

          <p>U.S. winter weather forecasts for the upcoming season are complex due to several competing atmospheric and oceanic factors. While current neutral ENSO conditions suggest a typical pattern of colder northern states and warmer southern states, a potential transition to a weak La Niña could introduce more frequent Arctic air blasts. Additionally, a significant marine heatwave in the northern Pacific, similar to one that preceded a harsh 2013-14 winter, could disrupt jet stream patterns, making the seasonal outlook highly uncertain.
