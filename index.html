          <h2>Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh Advocates for Central Bank Policy Overhaul</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 11:31:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, reportedly a leading candidate to head the institution, has publicly advocated for a "regime change" in the central bank's policy approach. Warsh criticized the Fed's perceived "credibility deficit" and its hesitation to cut interest rates, suggesting a new, coordinated partnership with the Treasury Department to better manage the nation's $36 trillion debt. His remarks align with President Trump's persistent demands for rate reductions and a shift in Fed leadership, reflecting a broader dissatisfaction with the current economic policy direction. This push for a more aligned fiscal and monetary strategy underscores potential significant changes in federal financial governance if Warsh assumes a leadership position.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is strategically selling a portion of its GE Vernova shares to realize substantial profits, preempting potential market disappointment despite a positive long-term outlook for the company. The decision stems from concerns that the upcoming earnings report, while likely strong, may not surpass the market's exceptionally high expectations, which could trigger profit-taking. This move aims to secure gains on a stock that has already surged 75% year-to-date, highlighting the significant role of market expectations in post-earnings stock performance. The trust seeks to mitigate risk by trimming exposure to a "hot" stock before its highly anticipated financial disclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old male has been arrested without incident in the alleged murder of Sunshine Stewart, a 48-year-old paddleboarder found dead in Maine earlier this month. Maine State Police revealed that Stewart's cause of death was strangulation and blunt force trauma, with her body discovered on July 3 at Crawford Pond, a popular recreation spot. The suspect, a local resident spending summer vacation in the area, was transported to the Long Creek Youth Development Center. This significant development provides a crucial update in a tragic case that had caused considerable fear and distress within the small, tight-knit community where Stewart had rented a summer campsite.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the controversial judicial nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. The 12-0 vote, achieved with Republican unity, occurred amidst a chaotic session where Democratic senators walked out in protest. Democrats accused the GOP of rushing the nomination and refusing to allow a whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, to testify about Bove's alleged unethical conduct, including suggesting ignoring court orders. Despite committee approval, Bove's confirmation by the full Senate faces significant uncertainty due to staunch opposition and concerns about his past actions and judgment.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is accelerating its U.S. volume production schedule by several quarters, driven by "strong interest" from its leading American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer has committed a total investment of $165 billion in advanced semiconductor manufacturing within the United States. This strategic move follows TSMC's report of record-high profits and revenue in its second-quarter earnings, surpassing analyst estimates. Despite President Trump's recent warnings of potential additional tariffs on semiconductors, the company's CEO, C.C. Wei, stated they have not observed any change in customer behavior for the second half of 2025, acknowledging uncertainties from tariff policies.</p>

Lawyers for Musk, who later acquired Twitter for $44 billion, have dismissed the lawsuit as a "sham" and denied any wrongdoing.

          <p>Following a record-breaking June heat dome that caused numerous heat-related illnesses and deaths, three Democratic lawmakers are proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a federal disaster. Currently, the Stafford Act, which governs disaster declarations, does not explicitly list extreme heat, preventing federal funding for heat-related impacts. While former FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell suggests existing grants could address heat issues, proponents argue that official disaster status would unlock crucial funds for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. The bill faces an uphill battle without Republican co-sponsors and amidst the Trump administration's focus on shifting disaster response to states.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a bill to claw back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, including significant cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. The 51-48 vote, part of President Trump's broader effort to reduce federal spending, followed an overnight "vote-a-rama" where amendments were debated. While a proposed $400 million cut to the US-backed HIV/Aids program (Pepfar) was reversed, billions were still cut from global health initiatives and over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The bill now returns to the House, facing an uncertain path as both chambers must agree on a final version by Friday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature reveals that migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers, with three-quarters of this disparity stemming from limited access to higher-paying industries and roles. Unlike countries such as Sweden and Canada, Germany demonstrates a slower rate in closing this wage gap, with a 7.7% difference still present for second-generation migrants, exceeding the international average. The research highlights that structural barriers, rather than unequal pay for identical work, are the primary drivers of this persistent inequality. Recommendations for improvement include enhanced language support, recognition of foreign qualifications, and expansion of professional networks to facilitate better integration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. homebuilders are implementing price cuts at the highest rate in three years, with 38% reporting reductions in July, as they face persistent weakening demand from potential buyers concerned about the broader economy. The National Association of Home Builders' confidence index, though slightly up, remains in negative territory for the 15th consecutive month, reflecting continued challenges. While a recently passed budget act offered some tax relief, elevated mortgage rates continue to severely impact affordability. Builders are also resorting to buying down mortgage rates, which, alongside price cuts, is impacting their margins. Single-family housing starts are projected to decline in 2025 due to these ongoing affordability issues and low buyer traffic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran has intensified a mass deportation campaign, sending hundreds of thousands of Afghan migrants back across the border, with over 1.4 million deported since January. This accelerated effort follows a recent conflict with Israel and the U.S., with Iranian authorities spuriously claiming Afghans assisted Israeli operations. Many legal residents have been deported before producing papers, and thousands of children have been separated from parents. Critics denounce the policy as a cynical ploy to deflect from the regime's failures and exploit anti-immigrant sentiment, highlighting the long-standing discrimination faced by Afghans in Iran and the dire conditions they face upon return to Taliban rule.</p>

This "Disney flywheel" approach, where content fuels immersive experiences, has made the experiences division one of the company's strongest profit drivers, with operating income more than double that of its content division.
