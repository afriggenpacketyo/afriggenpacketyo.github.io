          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico despite a U.S. immigration judge's order protecting him from being returned to his home country. The man, who is gay, had presented evidence of being sexually assaulted and held for ransom in Mexico while seeking asylum in the U.S. Judge Brian Murphy found the removal "lacked any semblance of due process," noting the man poses no security threat and was sent back to a country where he was allegedly sexually assaulted and kidnapped. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Mexico was a safe third option, but the judge's order joins a series of findings against Trump administration deportations.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The first nationalized service will run from Woking to Surbiton, though partially by rail replacement bus. The government is focusing on service improvements and reinvesting profits into infrastructure, rather than promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR trains will now be managed by the Department for Transport Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is implementing new policies that vastly limit press access inside the Pentagon complex, announced by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The restrictions ban reporters from many areas, including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, unless accompanied by a government escort. Hegseth, a former FOX News host, claims the policies are to protect national security, but the Pentagon Press Association has condemned the move as a direct attack on the freedom of the press. The National Press Club is urging the Pentagon to reverse course, stating that restricting access undermines public trust.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. This announcement intensifies the policy divisions within the Labour party, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has faced pressure to alter his approach to these issues. Reform UK intends to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The winter fuel payment provides up to £300 to pensioners, while the two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017, affects approximately 1.5 million families.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant problem at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies are prevalent on the walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to swat them away. While these midges do not bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions. The expo organizer is taking measures such as spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights, while Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura is seeking assistance from insecticide maker Earth Corp.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches have opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, a number that falls short of the city's full staffing needs but is an improvement from last year.

The Parks Department has implemented incentives such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards. Beachgoers have expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, providing them with a greater sense of security.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap, each side bringing home 307 soldiers, following a large-scale drone and missile attack on Kyiv that injured over a dozen people. This exchange is part of a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners from each side and is viewed as a rare instance of cooperation during the ongoing war. Kyiv was subjected to another set of drone strikes early Sunday, resulting in additional injuries and damage to residential buildings. The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted over seven hours, with debris from intercepted missiles and drones falling in several city districts.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault” redefined the modern understanding of sexual assault, has died at the age of 90. The book, published in 1975, argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence rather than passion, offering a comprehensive history of sexual assault and examining its use as a wartime tactic. "Against Our Will" helped to reshape societal attitudes toward sexual assault, leading to the opening of rape-crisis centers and the rewriting of laws to make prosecutions easier. Brownmiller's work ignited both praise and controversy, particularly for her assertion that sexual assault was a tool by which all men keep all women in fear.</p>

          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, prompting French authorities to investigate possible arson. The outage, affecting about 160,000 households, occurred after a fire at an electrical substation and a fallen high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, the festival's closing celebrations and Palme d'Or ceremony proceeded as planned, thanks to an independent power supply at the Palais des Festivals. Authorities condemned the damage to electrical infrastructures and mobilized resources to identify and arrest the perpetrators.

          <p>President Trump delivered his first military commencement address since returning to office, congratulating West Point cadets and claiming credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed a shift in U.S. foreign policy away from "nation-building crusades" and emphasized focusing on "crushing America's adversaries." The president also stated that critical race theory would no longer be taught at military academies and touted a record in peacetime recruiting. While Trump claimed a new recruiting record, CBS News reports that enlistments began rebounding before his administration, likely due to recruitment reforms introduced previously.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his remaining summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition that affects hearing, vision, and balance. The 76-year-old musician shared the news on social media, expressing his apologies to fans and explaining that his doctors advised against performing due to the exacerbation of his symptoms. NPH involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, and while treatable, it is often underdiagnosed. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to the stage in the future.</p>

          <p>The cost of driving lessons is increasing, causing financial strain for learners, while instructors argue the prices are justified. A DVSA survey shows the most common price bracket for an hour lesson is now £36 to £40, with some charging over £40. Many learners are forced to cut back on lessons or delay their tests due to the high costs. Driving instructors attribute the rising prices to increased expenses such as car costs, fuel, and insurance. The backlog of practical tests also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills.</p>

While thousands of refugees, like those from the Democratic Republic of Congo, have been waiting for years to be resettled in the U.S., the Trump administration has made an exception for Afrikaners, citing claims of "racial discrimination." This decision has sparked controversy and accusations of unfair treatment, with refugee advocacy groups arguing that protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution, regardless of race.</p>

          <p>Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec, France's most prolific known paedophile, have expressed shock and frustration at the lack of public interest in his trial, where he admitted to sexually assaulting 299 people, mostly children. The trial, meant to be a defining moment for French society, has been met with widespread indifference, leading victims to form a campaign group accusing the government of ignoring a "landmark" case. Some victims have chosen to reveal their identities in an effort to jolt France into paying more attention to the case and address the culture of deference that allowed Le Scouarnec to abuse with impunity for decades. Observers have pointed to the absence of a single totemic figure and a systemic silence surrounding child abuse in France as possible reasons for the lack of mobilization.</p>

Father Moses McPherson, a priest in ROCOR, has gained a large following online by championing a form of masculinity that rejects what he sees as feminized Western values. Converts often homeschool their children and believe women should prioritize family over career, reflecting a broader trend of conservative values.</p>

          <p>New government rules may allow local councils to take over unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects within specified time frames. Under these plans, housebuilders must commit to delivery timelines before receiving planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Developers who repeatedly fail to meet targets could lose their land, face penalties, and be denied future permissions. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, addressing the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, plans to apologize to fans after the final Premier League game amid widespread dissatisfaction with the club's owners and recent job cuts. While the exact content of his end-of-season address is undecided, Amorim aims to be honest and express his feelings to the supporters. Despite the protests, officials believe Amorim is the right person to lead a revival, and he is willing to engage with the fans.
