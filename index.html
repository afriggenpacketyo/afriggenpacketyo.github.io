          <p>The article reports that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new regulations requiring journalists to have official escorts for access to most of the Pentagon building. This decision follows several leaks from the Department of Defense that caused embarrassment to the administration. The Pentagon Press Association has criticized the move, characterizing it as an attack on press freedom and America's right to know what its military is doing, arguing that transparency is being compromised. The new rules aim to protect classified intelligence and sensitive information that could endanger US service members.</p>

The White House official indicated that Trump's approval comes despite earlier concerns that the deal could heighten national security risks. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to protecting American workers and the steel industry, as well as American national security. The partnership signifies a strategic move in the steel industry and has been a subject of discussion between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) face when considering pregnancy, as contraception is the primary treatment but poses a dilemma for those wanting children. Women like Marianne Barry express fear of discontinuing medication due to severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts associated with PMDD. Doctors highlight the lack of research and limited treatment options beyond contraception, suggesting more research is needed to provide better alternatives. The Welsh government acknowledges the need for improved diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD, and plans to allocate funding to address these issues.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how many young people in China are putting their retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures. They are too focused on their present circumstances to prioritize planning for old age. The Chinese government has urged young people to start planning early for retirement due to the country's rapidly aging population and strained pension system.

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using artificial intelligence to navigate the complexities of global trade turbulence caused by tariffs. AI tools help visualize supply chains, understand the impact of tariffs, and make faster decisions on adjustments. Salesforce has developed an AI agent to process changes in the U.S. customs system, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials affected by tariffs. These AI systems enable companies to dynamically adjust supplier strategies and manage duty exposure, enhancing trade policy strategy, but the quality of the data remains crucial for the success of any AI solution.

          <p>This article commemorates Jayant Narlikar, an Indian astrophysicist who passed away, known for his contributions to science education and his alternative to the Big Bang Theory. Narlikar, in collaboration with physicist Sir Fred Hoyle, proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe, known as the quasi-steady state model. Despite his theory not gaining as much popularity as the Big Bang, Narlikar's work has been valuable, and he also founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India. Narlikar's legacy extends to his science fiction writing and his dedication to challenging pseudoscience, leaving a significant impact on Indian science and education.</p>

Although Israel has allowed a limited number of trucks carrying aid, critics argue it's insufficient, with hundreds of trucks needed daily. Supplies are stuck at distribution points due to security clearance delays and logistical problems, exacerbated by damaged infrastructure and fuel shortages. UNRWA, WFP, UNICEF, and other organizations are involved in aid distribution, but face numerous obstacles, including the need for supplies to be loaded onto other trucks.

          <p>The government has postponed the release of its child poverty strategy, originally due in the spring, until at least the autumn, sparking criticism from the SNP and charities. The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy affecting 1.5 million families. While some condemn the delay, others suggest it could allow for a more substantial strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship. The government insists it remains committed to tackling child poverty and will publish an ambitious strategy with fully-funded measures later this year.</p>

          <p>This article examines the trend of "quiet quitting" among Japan's Gen Z, who prioritize work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these young workers are choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to have more "me time." This shift in attitude is attributed to factors such as witnessing their parents sacrifice personal lives for companies, stagnant wages, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts view this change as a positive step towards reducing overwork and improving overall well-being, addressing issues like 'karoshi' (death by overwork).</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings after a rain delay and a blown save by closer Tanner Scott, but the game highlighted the team's pitching depth issues. Starter Clayton Kershaw was limited to two innings due to the rain delay, and the bullpen had to cover 11 innings, stretching the staff thin. Despite holding a lead, Scott's struggles allowed the Mets to tie the game, but Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th inning secured the win for the Dodgers.

Taiwan's only official diplomatic ally in Africa is eSwatini, and few countries host commercial or trade offices for the island.

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks lost to the Golden State Valkyries 82-73, highlighting the competitiveness between the two California WNBA teams. Despite an early lead, the Sparks struggled with inconsistency, particularly in the second quarter, allowing the Valkyries to take control. Dearica Hamby led the Sparks with 25 points, but the team's frustration was evident after the game, with coach Lynne Roberts emphasizing the need for a full 40-minute performance.

          <p>New farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. The initiative responds to mounting criticism over soaring rice prices, which have hurt households amid rising inflation. Koizumi is also exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. for potential collaboration. While the plan aims to cool the abnormal surge in prices, analysts remain uncertain whether it will lead to an overall price drop due to limited reserves compared to national demand.</p>
