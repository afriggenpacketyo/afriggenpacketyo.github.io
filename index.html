        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales experienced a steeper-than-anticipated drop of 0.9% in May, signaling a pullback in consumer spending due to economic unease and declining gas sales. This decline, which followed a 0.1% decrease in April, surpassed economists' expectations of a 0.6% drop. Sectors such as building materials, garden stores, and auto dealerships saw significant sales declines, while online sales and furniture stores experienced gains. The retail sales data is adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, and it indicates a potential impact on GDP growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey has advocated for a "national reset" regarding grooming gangs, urging openness and scrutiny during a newly announced inquiry. Her report highlighted that authorities have been "shying away from" the ethnicity of people involved in grooming gangs, and she stressed the importance of action from political leaders. The inquiry, prompted by Casey's report on group-based child sexual abuse in England and Wales, aims to address the issue comprehensively and ensure the implementation of recommendations. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has committed to following all 12 of the report's recommendations, including ensuring serious charges for adults engaging in sexual assault with children under 16.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures, including flight reductions and a pause on retrofits, as weaker-than-expected travel demand makes achieving break-even operating margins in 2025 unlikely. CEO Joanna Geraghty stated that the airline is relying on borrowed cash to sustain operations and is assessing leadership team restructuring for greater efficiency. The carrier is also parking some of its Airbus jets as part of the effort to manage expenses. This move follows a failed acquisition of Spirit Airlines and a recent partnership with United Airlines aimed at increasing revenue.</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in targeted shootings at their homes. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended after a two-day manhunt and faces first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. Authorities are investigating whether Boelter knew the victims personally, as he served on a state board with Hoffman. The shootings have sparked outrage and calls for an end to political violence, with Governor Tim Walz describing the attacks as "politically motivated" and denouncing such acts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deployment of active-duty U.S. military in Los Angeles is a rare and perilous event, reminiscent of the 1992 riots, and the period from 1957 to 1968, when military forces actively patrolled U.S. soil on eight separate occasions. These deployments during societal tumult, especially over race and the Vietnam War, resulted in only one fatality due to remarkable restraint by the military. However, today's weaker norms, polarized political elites, and the absence of Army military police trained in crowd control raise concerns about potential escalation. The Army's conduct during these deployments was far from flawless, and contributed to a long-term shift in civilian law enforcement that encouraged the adoption of military-style equipment and tactics.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, as consumers reduced spending following a surge in March to avoid President Trump's tariffs on imports. Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped by 0.9% in May, with a significant decrease in auto sales after a March spike. Despite low unemployment and cooling inflation, consumer confidence has declined, contributing to the slowdown in spending. Sales dropped in home and garden centers, electronics stores, and grocery stores, while online retailers, clothing stores, and furniture stores saw increases.</p>

The relationship between Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, despite their differing political ideologies, has been characterized by warmth and friendship. Strong cultural links, Trump's Anglophilia, and the UK's avoidance of trade and foreign policy conflicts with Washington contribute to this preferential relationship.</p>

          <p>According to China expert William Figueroa, China lacks the capacity for power projection in the Middle East and has no appetite to be directly involved in the Iran-Israel conflict. China's stance mirrors its approach to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, focusing on dialogue and de-escalation rather than military action. While China is a major buyer of Iranian oil, this economic relationship does not give Beijing meaningful influence over Iran. Figueroa suggests that further US entanglement in Middle Eastern conflicts would likely be viewed as strategically advantageous for China.</p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing "what's going on in the Middle East." The decision followed escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, with both countries trading airstrikes and missile attacks. Trump affirmed that his early return to Washington was not related to ceasefire talks, despite French President Macron's suggestion. The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, but is helping intercept Iranian missiles, and has warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.</p>
