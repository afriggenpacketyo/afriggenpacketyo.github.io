          <p>Border Patrol agents are increasingly operating in major US cities, far from traditional border zones, under the Trump administration's mass deportation plan, sparking concerns among lawyers and human rights advocates. Critics argue that agents, trained for border security, are ill-suited for civil immigration enforcement in urban areas, leading to aggressive tactics and alleged constitutional violations. The article highlights incidents in Chicago and Los Angeles, where agents have been accused of indiscriminate targeting and excessive force. This expansion, leveraging a 1946 statute, raises questions about accountability and the impact on community interactions.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that over 40% of US employees receive "workslop"—AI-generated content lacking substance—which is reportedly destroying productivity. While big tech and media hype are often blamed, the article argues that the primary responsibility for AI's ineffective deployment lies with employers. It questions whether companies invest in proper training, standardized tools, clear policies, and measurable metrics for AI use. The article concludes that AI is merely a tool, and its successful implementation depends on thoughtful investment in people and processes, rather than expecting magical results from technology alone.</p>
