          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its 2025 sales growth outlook downward to 13-21% due to increased competition from copycat drug compounders affecting Wegovy sales, despite exceeding first-quarter profit expectations. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported a net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner, surpassing analyst forecasts. Wegovy sales increased by 83% year-over-year, reaching 17.36 billion Danish kroner, while Ozempic sales hit 32.72 billion Danish kroner, also exceeding expectations. The company now anticipates operating profit growth of 16-24% for 2025, slightly lower than the previous forecast.</p>

          <p>AMD has cautioned that new US export restrictions on sales to China will result in a $1.5 billion revenue hit this year, overshadowing an otherwise positive 2025 outlook.

CEO Lisa Su remains confident about the overall demand for AI infrastructure and anticipates new chips will drive sales in the latter half of the year.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced his concerns about potentially losing access to China's rapidly growing AI market due to tightening US export restrictions. He emphasized that losing the Chinese market, projected to reach $50 billion in the next few years, would be a significant loss for the company. Huang highlighted the importance of selling to China to generate revenue for the US and create jobs. Nvidia has been grappling with US export controls, which now include the China-tailored H20 AI chips, impacting its ability to compete in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and reduced bank reserve requirements, to bolster economic growth amid trade tensions. The measures aim to support key sectors such as technology and real estate, and to stimulate domestic credit demand. Analysts suggest these moves reflect a growing urgency to address economic challenges and capitalize on easing depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan. However, some experts note that the impact on credit demand may be limited without additional fiscal policy measures.</p>

However, the deal is still in the final stages, with detailed scrutiny and a signing ceremony expected in about a year. A key point of contention is the agreement allowing Indian workers transferred to the UK to be exempt from national insurance payments for the first three years, a move criticized by some as unfair to British workers. Despite mixed reactions, the deal is seen as a significant achievement amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the US and EU.</p>
