          <p>A BBC report accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza, highlighting the challenges in obtaining information due to restricted access for international news teams and the killing of numerous journalists. The article details concerns from international lawyers and diplomats about potential complicity in criminal investigations related to the conflict, particularly regarding restrictions on aid and the high number of civilian casualties. The report also references the ongoing case at the International Court of Justice alleging genocide, and the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Israeli officials. The piece underscores the deep divisions between Israel and much of the international community regarding the conduct of the war and its adherence to international law. The author's reflection on the author's reflections on the tragedy and moral implications of the conflict are evident throughout the piece, leaving a somber feeling after reading it.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted across Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted citywide operations resulting in numerous arrests. In response, President Trump deployed at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County, citing clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The protests were sparked by ICE officers executing search warrants at multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District, leading to a tense standoff. The deployment of the National Guard under Title 10 authority, bypassing the governor's approval, has drawn criticism from local officials who view it as an inflammatory measure that will escalate tensions. The events highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the federal government's response to protests.</p>

          <p>President Trump utilized a rarely invoked authority to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, bypassing California Governor Gavin Newsom's approval. The action is based on Title 10, a provision that allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, raising concerns about the use of military force to quell domestic dissent. Legal scholars and civil rights organizations have criticized the move, arguing it sets a dangerous precedent for federal intervention in state affairs and infringes on the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The situation underscores the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policies.</p>

Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained immense popularity in Japan and were later included in the Museum of Modern Art's collection.
