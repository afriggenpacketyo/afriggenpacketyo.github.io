          <p>Defense analysts and politicians in Taiwan are raising concerns about the performance of Pakistan‚Äôs mainland Chinese-supplied weapons in clashes with India. The clash, in which Pakistan reportedly brought down several Indian jets using mainland Chinese-made J-10C aircraft and PL-15E long-range missiles, is seen as a potential preview of a conflict between Taiwan and mainland China. The analysts underscore how Beijing‚Äôs maturing system-centric warfare doctrine and exported technology are beginning to outmatch the mixed arsenals fielded by Western-aligned militaries.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is escalating his efforts to address homelessness by urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property. Newsom's initiative includes a model ordinance that municipalities can adopt, coinciding with the release of over $3 billion in state housing funds. While the ordinance doesn't specify criminal penalties, it aims to outlaw encampments, a move signaling a shift in the Democratic party's approach to homelessness. The governor emphasizes that no one should be criminally punished for sleeping outside without alternatives, as California grapples with a significant unsheltered homeless population.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Democratic Alliance (DA) is challenging the amended Employment Equity Act in court, arguing it is unconstitutional and economically harmful. The act imposes strict hiring targets for non-white employees, aiming to address historical inequalities.

          <p>A listeria outbreak in the United States, linked to ready-to-eat food products, has sickened at least 10 people in California and Nevada, leading to hospitalizations and a voluntary recall by Fresh & Ready Foods LLC. Federal officials began investigating last year but reopened the case in April after finding listeria in samples from the company. The FDA found that six of the 10 people who got sick had been hospitalized before becoming ill with listeria, and Fresh & Ready Foods items had been served in at least three of the healthcare facilities where the patients had been previously treated. The recalled products were sold in several states at retailers, hospitals, hotels, and airports.</p>

          <p>President Trump's auction, offering access to him in exchange for purchasing his family's cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, has drawn criticism and raised ethical questions. The auction, which promises a private dinner and White House tour to top buyers, has increased the memecoin's trading price, benefiting the Trump family financially. However, it has also led to concerns about potential attempts to corruptly influence the president and has even derailed crypto legislation in Congress.

The agreement involves suspending reciprocal tariffs, but broad-based 10% duties will remain in effect.

          <p>Global technology and chip stocks experienced a significant rally following the U.S. and China's agreement to temporarily pause tariffs on each other's goods. Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm saw gains in premarket trading, reflecting investor relief that trade tensions may ease and supply chains may be less disrupted. The agreement, which suspends most levies for 90 days, has boosted investor confidence in the tech sector, which has been particularly vulnerable to the trade conflict between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's trip to the Middle East is expected to focus on securing deals for American-designed AI chips. Gulf States, eager to build data centers, require U.S. approval to purchase these chips, giving the U.S. leverage in the region. The Trump administration is reportedly more willing to use AI chips to strengthen strategic bonds, potentially influencing trade talks and other negotiations. Tech executives from companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, AMD, and Alphabet are scheduled to attend an investment forum during the trip.</p>

          <p>A fire at an apartment building in Milwaukee resulted in four fatalities, critical injuries to four others, and displacement of approximately 200 residents. The intense blaze prompted residents to jump from windows, and the first firefighters were overwhelmed by the flames. The building, constructed in 1968, lacked a sprinkler system, which Fire Chief Aaron Lipski said could have contained the fire. The five-alarm fire, which began in a common area, rendered the 85-unit building uninhabitable.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have presented a plan to cut at least $880 billion, largely from Medicaid, to help fund $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The legislation proposes new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats warn will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade. Republicans argue they are rooting out waste and abuse, while Democrats criticize the cuts as an attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget proposal, though unlikely to pass as is, reveals his administration's intent to overhaul the social safety net. The budget seeks to cut $163 billion from education, housing, and health programs, particularly those aiding lower-income Americans. The proposal would shift federal rental assistance into block grants, potentially diverting funds away from direct rental support. This approach mirrors the 1996 welfare reform, which resulted in states using welfare funds for unrelated programs, and it aims to overhaul the social safety net without igniting a fierce backlash.</p>
