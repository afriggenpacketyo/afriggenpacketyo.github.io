          <p>The White House has unveiled a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing an earlier image that drew comparisons to a mugshot. In the new portrait, Trump looks directly into the camera with a serious expression, wearing a blue suit and red tie against a dark backdrop. This contrasts with the previous portrait, which had unusual lighting and was likened to his Fulton County Jail mugshot. A White House official stated that the initial portrait was always intended as a placeholder, and this new portrait represents the optimism and resolve of America following the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and potential fines over its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports, specifically after a transgender athlete, AB Hernandez, won two high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department, led by Harmeet Dhillon, claims that the California Interscholastic Foundation's (CIF) policies violate the rights of female athletes under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. President Trump has singled out Hernandez on social media, promising large-scale fines for the state, while California's Attorney General's office is reviewing the letter and committed to defending the rights of transgender students.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," calling it a "disgusting abomination" and accusing it of massively increasing the national debt. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and makes cuts to assistance programs. Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed Musk's criticism, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune cited differing economic models and the bill's potential for growth and deficit reduction.

          <p>President Trump has formally requested Congress to take back $1.1 billion in funding set aside for public broadcasters like NPR and PBS for the next two years, claiming they have become radical, left-wing echo chambers. This request is part of a larger White House package of $9.4 billion in proposed clawbacks, which includes funding for foreign aid. The rescission request has prompted lobbying efforts from public radio stations and criticism from Democrats, who accuse Trump of settling political scores and undermining the free press, while some Republicans support the cuts, viewing public broadcasting as biased.</p>

The company has worked to reduce its exposure to China, limit price hikes, cut costs, and moved manufacturing to other countries.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has taken into custody the family of Mohamed Soliman, the man accused of attempted murder in the fire attack on demonstrators in Colorado. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said authorities are investigating whether Soliman's family knew about or supported Sunday's attack. Soliman, an Egyptian national, entered the U.S. legally in August 2022 on a visa that expired in February 2023, and applied for asylum the next month.</p>
