          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll indicates that Donald Trump's approval rating is the lowest for any president at the 100-day mark in the past 80 years. The poll reveals that only 39% of respondents approve of Trump's job performance, while 55% disapprove, reflecting widespread concerns about his policies and the economy. A significant majority, 72%, believe his economic policies will likely cause a recession, and 73% view the economy as being in bad shape. The poll also highlights negative perceptions of Trump's handling of key issues, including the stock market, tariffs, and foreign relations. Optimism score: 20</p>

          <p>As stock and bond markets experience increased volatility, dividend stocks are attracting wider investor interest due to the income they provide from corporate cash flow. There are over 100 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, with actively managed options like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG) aiming to identify higher-quality dividend payers for better capital appreciation and yield. While tech stocks can't be avoided entirely in dividend funds, some ETFs offer exposure without overweighting the sector like the S&P 500 Index. Actively managed dividend ETFs may be particularly beneficial in volatile markets, but investors should be cautious about buying solely based on yield. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 70</p>

          <p>An Army Black Hawk helicopter crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, resulting in fatalities, is being investigated for potential missteps in air traffic control procedures. The crew requested and received permission to use “visual separation,” a common practice allowing pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. However, this procedure, while routine, can be risky if not properly executed, raising questions about its handling in this instance. Aviation experts have cautioned about the potential dangers associated with visual separation when not managed correctly. Optimism score: 5</p>
