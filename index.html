          <p>Driven by a burgeoning domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy, China is significantly increasing its coffee imports from African nations. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are investing heavily in the region, signing deals in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to secure supply chains and build local processing facilities. This strategic move aims to meet the soaring demand within China and leverage global trade uncertainties, establishing a stronger economic foothold in Africa's coffee market. The effort reflects a broader strategy to diversify and lock in essential commodity supplies.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to hold its key policy rate steady at 5.5%, a move that was widely anticipated by economists. This decision comes as India navigates heightened trade tensions with the United States, particularly concerning its trade relations with Russia. While noting that global trade challenges and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the RBI expressed confidence in the country's resilient domestic growth. The central bank maintained its GDP growth forecast at 6.5% for the fiscal year and lowered its inflation projection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Lochridge, the former Director of Marine Operations for Oceangate, has spoken out following a US Coast Guard report on the 2023 Titan submersible implosion. He claims he was fired in 2018 for raising critical safety concerns about the vessel's experimental carbon fiber hull and lack of independent certification. Lochridge asserts that the tragedy, which killed all five people aboard including CEO Stockton Rush, was preventable and that passengers were "sold a lie." He also criticizes US regulatory bodies for failing to act on his warnings, a point echoed in the official report.</p>

          <p>A senior UN official has cautioned the Security Council against a potential expansion of Israeli military operations in Gaza, labeling such a move as "deeply alarming." The warning follows reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a full reoccupation of the territory to defeat Hamas, a plan that has reportedly caused division within Israel's military leadership. The official, Miroslav Jenča, emphasized the catastrophic risk this would pose to millions of Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, urging for a ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez was the star performer, scoring two goals to lead Los Angeles FC to a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty in the first half and, after Tigres equalized, secured the win with a skillful individual goal in the second half. The result places Tigres on the verge of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other match outcomes. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the next round also remain slim.</p>

          <p>Supporters of Sheffield Wednesday football club are voicing their frustration and mental exhaustion over the ongoing financial crisis under owner Dejphon Chansiri. Years of mismanagement, late payments to tax authorities, and transfer embargoes have left the club in a dire situation, including the closure of a stadium stand due to safety concerns. Fans, some of whom have supported the club for decades, feel abandoned by Chansiri and are planning protests, urging him to sell the club. The crisis highlights broader issues of football governance and the profound impact on the local community and loyal fanbase.</p>

          <p>Less than three months after lifting long-standing sanctions, the Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff on Syria, the highest rate for any country. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts argue the move sends a punitive signal that could hinder the war-torn nation's desperate need for foreign investment and reconstruction. The tariff is seen as a tool to maintain US leverage over Syria's new transitional government, potentially to pressure it on issues like normalizing relations with Israel. This economic pressure comes as Syria grapples with a collapsed infrastructure and relies heavily on international aid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The state plans to support the local community and the 1,200 affected employees through an economic resiliency plan. The site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, will be maintained for potential reuse or sale.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Committee Chairman James Comer also subpoenaed several former top Justice Department and FBI officials. The move comes after the Trump administration decided against releasing more federal files on Epstein, sparking bipartisan demands for more transparency. The committee seeks to investigate the federal government's handling of the Epstein case and has requested depositions from the Clintons and others this fall.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced that the U.S. government is canceling $500 million in funding for 22 projects developing mRNA vaccines for viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy stated that his department determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for these viruses and that the funds will be shifted to what he called "safer, broader vaccine platforms." The decision has drawn sharp criticism from health experts, who credit mRNA technology with saving millions of lives during the pandemic and view the move as a dangerous step backward for public health preparedness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their largest annual decline in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago. The primary cause is severe and widespread coral bleaching due to heat stress from climate change, compounded by cyclones and outbreaks of coral-eating starfish. This unprecedented decline has pushed the vital ecosystem toward a tipping point where it may not recover between catastrophic events. Australia's other major reef, Ningaloo, also experienced bleaching, marking the first time both reefs turned white simultaneously.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its next five-year plan, economists are debating whether to include specific, measurable targets for consumption to help rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment. Proponents argue that setting a benchmark, such as the household consumption rate as a share of GDP, would provide a clear policy goal to boost domestic demand and improve living standards. However, other influential thinkers are hesitant, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as policy goals and suggesting they may not be the most effective way to stimulate spending.

          <p>Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had an underwhelming start to his season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is showing encouraging signs of a comeback. The Japanese phenom has been progressing in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and a new two-seam pitch being added to his arsenal. The Dodgers are hopeful that a healthy Sasaki could rejoin the active roster by late August and potentially contribute to their postseason push, either as a starter or a hard-throwing reliever. His return would provide valuable pitching depth for the team's World Series defense.</p>
