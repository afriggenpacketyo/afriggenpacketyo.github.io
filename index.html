          <p>A hot air balloon carrying 21 passengers caught fire and crashed in Praia Grande, Brazil, resulting in the deaths of eight people and injuries to 13 others. The incident occurred during festivities celebrating Catholic saints, a popular time for hot air ballooning in the area. State Governor Jorginho Mello expressed condolences and mobilized authorities to provide assistance to the families and victims. This marks the second fatal balloon accident in Brazil within a week, raising concerns about safety regulations for such activities. The clear weather conditions at the time of the crash are part of the investigation into what caused the balloon to erupt in flames.</p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war saw continued strikes, including an attack on an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan. Israel's defense minister claimed the military killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one responsible for funding Hamas. Iran retaliated with drones and missiles, though Israel intercepted most of them, and the Israeli military says it has eliminated more than 50% of Iran's missile launchers. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi cautioned against U.S. intervention, while President Trump considers his options for the United States' potential military involvement.</p>

Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed gratitude to the U.S. for its efforts in securing his release.

          <p>A new federal health initiative led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. aims to warn Americans about the dangers of ultra-processed foods. Key advisor Calley Means, who could benefit financially from the campaign's promotion of wearable health devices, has raised conflict-of-interest concerns. Means's sister, Casey Means, Kennedyâ€™s nominee for US surgeon general, also runs a company selling such devices, with Calley Means's company working with Casey's venture. The campaign, costing $10-20 million, seeks to inspire Americans to improve their health through real food consumption, but faces criticism for its unconventional hiring practices and potential biases.</p>

          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran continue, speculation grows about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but experts warn of the disastrous consequences historically associated with such interventions. Foreign-imposed regime change violates international law, often leading to power vacuums, violence, and instability, as seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Eckart Woertz emphasizes the unlikelihood of external regime change without ground forces and a strong internal rebel movement. The article suggests that aerial bombardment alone is insufficient, drawing on historical examples to caution against repeating past mistakes in Iran.</p>

          <p>As a severe heatwave impacts the US, experts warn that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available overseas, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, where sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug rather than a cosmetic, have limited the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. While US sunscreens effectively block UVB rays, their UVA protection lags behind products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists stress the importance of using broad-spectrum sunscreens with SPF 30 or higher for adequate protection.</p>

          <p>Newly unsealed court documents reveal details about Vance Boelter, the suspect charged in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and that he had given her a "bailout plan" due to concerns about potential armed individuals showing up at their home. Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans, who were wounded in the attack, recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer, underscoring the premeditated nature of the violence.</p>

          <p>A senior Iranian official stated that proposals from European powers during nuclear program talks in Geneva were "unrealistic," suggesting a potential impasse. The official indicated that Iran would review the proposals in Tehran and respond at a future meeting. European diplomats aimed to test Tehran's willingness to negotiate a new nuclear deal despite ongoing conflict with Israel. The E3 proposed a parallel negotiating track, potentially without the U.S., involving tougher inspections and some uranium enrichment capacity for Tehran, but Iran dismissed negotiating its defensive capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Returns cause big trouble for Amazon sellers, but return rates show signs of slowing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 09:32:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this article WMT\n\nAMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nReturns on Amazon are free and easy for shoppers, but they're risky and expensive for the small businesses that sell a majority of the goods on the world's biggest e-commerce site. Returns have driven some sellers to exit the popular Fulfillment by Amazon program, while others told CNBC they'd like to leave the platform altogether. At the heart of the problem is a big rise in returns fraud, which has led to customers mistakenly receiving used products when they ordered something new. In two particularly egregious examples involving baby products described to CNBC, Amazon sent customers used diapers and a chiller with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside. "I really don't think that consumers understand how many small businesses are on Amazon and how their return habits affect small businesses and families like mine," said Rachelle Baron, owner of Beau and Belle Littles, which sells reusable swim diapers on Amazon. Baron said her business tanked after a return incident with Amazon. The e-commerce platform shipped soiled swim diapers to customers after the used baby products had been returned to Amazon, Baron said. "There was actually two diapers that were sent out that were poopy," she said. In 2024, nearly 14% of all U.S. retail returns were fraudulent, up from 5% in 2018, according to a report by the National Retail Federation. In total, the report found that returns cost retailers $890 billion in 2024. Amazon started charging sellers in its fulfillment program (FBA) a new fee in June 2024 for items that exceed certain return rate thresholds. Sellers who sign up for FBA rely on Amazon for logistics, including shipping, packing and returns. In September, a couple months after the fee went into effect, e-commerce group Helium 10 saw return rates for U.S. Amazon sellers drop nearly 5%. "It's forcing the seller to have higher quality listings and higher quality products," said Helium 10 General Manager Zoe Lu. Amazon has also started adding a warning label to some "frequently returned items," which could be contributing to the dip.\n\nRising prices\n\nHowever, the new fee may also be leading to rising prices. One survey by e-commerce analysis company SmartScout found that 65% of sellers said they raised prices in 2024 directly because of Amazon fee changes. Other sellers told CNBC returns fraud is the reason they've raised prices. In total, CNBC talked to seven Amazon sellers to find out how they're handling the rising cost of returns. "We're running at about just over 1% net profit on Amazon, totally due to fraud and return abuse," said Lorie Corlett, who sells Sterling Spectrum protective cases for hot wheels. She said her return rate is 4% on Amazon and only 1% on other marketplaces like Walmart . "It's really Amazon that's accountable at the end of the day. People would stop doing it if Amazon held them accountable." Amazon told CNBC it has no tolerance for fraudulent returns and that it takes action against some scammers. Those measures include denying refunds and requiring customer identity verification. Mike Jelliff sells professional music gear through his GeekStands brand on Amazon and eight other marketplaces. He said his return rate on Amazon is three times higher than the average he sees elsewhere. "On eBay , we're allowed to block specific customers out," Jelliff said. "But on Amazon, that customer is still allowed to repurchase from us." Jelliff showed CNBC the system of about 40 cameras he's installed in his Tyler, Texas, warehouse to track every outgoing item, incoming return and unboxing. He uses the images when filing appeals with Amazon, including when customers request refunds claiming they never receive an item. He keeps a blacklist of repeat offenders who commit this kind of fraud and those who return used and damaged items, which become a total loss for him. Amazon has made some improvements to its returns process, said Jelliff, who doesn't rely on FBA. This includes Amazon allowing small businesses to make multiple appeals when fighting a fraudulent return. Amazon has also let Jelliff opt-out of automatic return labels for items above $100 starting in 2023, and his return rate has been dropping since.\n\nMike Jelliff at his GeekStands warehouse in Tyler, Texas, on June 6, 2025. Jelliff sees three times more returns of his professional music gear on Amazon, compared to the average on other marketplaces like eBay and Walmart. Jacob Schatz\n\nWhy returns are destroyed\n\nFiguring out which returns are fraudulent and which are ready for re-sale is labor-intensive and item specific, experts said. That creates plenty of room for error. "Because it's such a large operation, things are missed," said Lu of Helium 10. "I think they're probably missed on the margins, but these stories are very impactful because it is such a reckoning for the brand." Ceres Chill founder Lisa Myers, who once relied on Amazon to handle returns for her business as part of FBA, has one of these stories. In 2023, Amazon sent one of Ceres Chill's products to a customer with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside, said Myers, adding that the customer wrote a review saying, "she will never forget that smell." "To have something, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but dangerous, somebody else's bodily fluids in your kitchen rotting in something that you had intended to use for your child is unacceptable," Myers said. "That's the moment I broke down crying and just sat down and thought, I have no idea how this could have happened." Myers said she left FBA after the incident, leaving behind benefits like having her products labeled with Amazon's Prime badge. "It hurts our business to not participate in Fulfilled by Amazon," Myers said. "It's just we're not willing to, we will never put profit over the safety and, frankly, mental health of our customers." Instead, Myers outsources all her returns to baby resell specialist Goodbuy Gear, which is on track to re-sell 200,000 returned baby products this year.\n\nRe-selling responsibly</p>

Izadi, a senior Quds Force commander responsible for coordination with Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, was reportedly killed in an apartment in the Shia holy city of Qom. Shahryari, the head of Unit 190 - responsible for smuggling weapons and funds to Iran's regional proxies - was assassinated by a drone strike while traveling by car in western Iran. Izadi played a central role in co-ordinating Tehran's support for Palestinian armed groups and was reportedly instrumental in arming and financing Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which carried out the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel.</p>
