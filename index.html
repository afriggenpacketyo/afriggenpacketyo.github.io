          <p>UK-based AI startup Nscale has rapidly emerged as a key player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market, securing close to $700 million from Nvidia and a five-year, $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft and Aker. The company, which spun out of a cryptocurrency mining infrastructure firm, is now partnering with Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure in Europe, including a supercomputer in the UK. Nscale aims to address Europe's computing capacity shortage and fragmented market, with plans to deploy hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs by 2027. This rapid expansion positions Nscale as a significant force in the global AI landscape, attracting substantial investment and strategic alliances.</p>

          <p>Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei announced plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, utilizing in-house Ascend chips and claiming it will be the world's most powerful AI computing system. This development directly challenges Nvidia, as China pushes for self-reliance in advanced semiconductors amid ongoing US export restrictions. The system groups numerous homegrown chips to achieve high computing capabilities, with a more advanced Atlas 960 version planned for 2027 supporting over 1 million Ascend chips. Huawei's announcement aligns with China's emphasis on domestic chip technologies, underscoring its ambition to become a global AI leader despite potential exaggerations of its technical prowess.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced that late-stage trial results for its once-daily oral semaglutide pill, dubbed the "Wegovy pill," showed "significant" weight reduction comparable to its injectable counterpart. The Oasis 4 trial reported an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and comorbidities. This development intensifies the race for an oral obesity treatment, offering patients an alternative to injections. The pill is currently under FDA review, with a decision expected in the fourth quarter, and aims to be manufactured entirely in the U.S. It offers a competitive profile against rivals like Eli Lilly's Orforglipron.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to fight "vexatious, last-minute claims" that hinder migrant deportations, after a High Court injunction temporarily blocked the removal of an Eritrean man to France. The man, who arrived by small boat, claimed modern slavery just hours before his scheduled deportation under the "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. Mahmood criticized such claims as making a "mockery of our laws" and affirmed her commitment to securing borders. The Home Office plans to appeal the decision and is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to prevent misuse, highlighting ongoing challenges in the UK's migration policy.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged South Korea to align with China against "rampant unilateral bullying" and trade protectionism, emphasizing the need to safeguard the international free trade system. Wang also called for sincerity, mutual trust, and deeper cooperation while handling sensitive issues. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho sought Beijing's help in restarting dialogue with Pyongyang to pursue denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula. Cho's visit to Beijing aims to pave the way for a potential visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea for the Apec leaders’ summit, which could also host a meeting between Xi and Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.13% to a fresh record high, driven by real estate and technology sectors, as Asian markets reacted to the Federal Reserve's expected 25-basis-point rate cut. The Fed framed the cut as "risk management" and indicated two more reductions this year, with further cuts in 2026 and 2027, but none in 2028. Other Asian markets traded mixed, while the Bank of Japan is anticipated to keep its policy rates steady. The article notes that while Japan's exporters received some relief from potential tariffs, they could still be impacted by a future slowdown in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, this article argues that America is at a dangerous crossroads, struggling to overcome a spiral of hatred and violence. Despite calls for unity, political incentives often reward extreme rhetoric, exacerbating divisions.

While some express optimism about America's ability to move forward, others see no clear path out, noting that both political camps have retreated to opposing narratives.

          <p>ABC has indefinitely suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following controversial comments Kimmel made about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel suggested that "the Maga gang" was politicizing Kirk's killing. Major TV station owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, had already pulled the show, with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticizing Kimmel's remarks as "sickest conduct possible" and urging action. President Trump celebrated the suspension, calling Kimmel "ratings challenged." The decision has sparked a heated debate about free speech, censorship, and political discourse, with unions like the WGA and SAG-AFTRA condemning the move as a threat to freedoms.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a 2024 running mate, but she deemed the pairing too risky for America. Harris writes that Buttigieg "would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man," citing the challenges of asking America to accept a Black woman married to a Jewish man. She ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The article highlights the complex considerations of identity politics in presidential campaigns.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis informed staff that the struggling carrier plans to slash its November flight schedule by 25% and braced employees for more job cuts.

Hundreds of pilots have already faced furloughs and demotions, and flight attendants have taken voluntary unpaid leaves.

          <p>Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank (PBOC) will engage in moderate monetary easing, supporting the yuan. The Fed's 0.25 percentage point cut provides more room for looser monetary policy in China. Experts forecast a smaller rate cut from the PBOC compared to the Fed this year, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan. This article suggests a cautious and strategic approach by China to its monetary policy in response to global economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship is scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station after a delay caused by two premature engine shutdowns. NASA confirmed the issue was resolved, explaining that an early warning system initiated shutdowns due to a conservative safeguard in software settings. The cargo ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including spare parts and holiday treats, is now expected to arrive Thursday morning. This maiden flight of the upgraded Cygnus XL, which is longer and carries more cargo, marks a significant milestone for Northrop Grumman's resupply missions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced his plan to designate antifa, an umbrella term for far-left activist groups, as a "major terrorist organization" and recommended investigating its funders. This declaration comes despite previous FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony that antifa is an ideology, not a hierarchical organization, which complicates such a designation under existing law. There is no domestic equivalent to the state department's foreign terror organization list, primarily due to First Amendment protections. Trump's announcement, praised by some Republican senators, follows his criticism of Jimmy Kimmel and reflects a broader effort to target what he calls "radical left" political violence.</p>
