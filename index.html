          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The resentencing comes after years of claims by the brothers that they acted in self-defense due to alleged abuse. Relatives expressed joy at the decision, with their cousin Annamaria Baralt stating she had been crying tears of joy all day. The decision was influenced by years of advocacy by the family to free the brothers, who were convicted of first-degree murder.</p>

He claims agents questioned him about his opinions on Donald Trump, Israel, Hamas, and the Houthis, leading him to assert his First Amendment rights. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the detention but denied that political beliefs were the trigger, but Piker responded on his own livestream that this claim was baseless.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, describing it as an effort to “give them a chance at greatness” after talks with Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The announcement came as the White House confirmed that Trump would meet with Syria’s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former rebel commander whose forces helped overthrow Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Sharaa's pitch to Trump for sanctions relief included access to Syrian oil, reconstruction contracts and to build a Trump Tower in Damascus.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge resentenced Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole.

After the judge agreed to resentence them, the brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court, detailing the brutal killings and their decision to continue shooting their parents. The brothers' lawyer said that the brothers were one huge step closer to bringing the boys home.</p>

While all three doctors value their relationships with patients, they hold differing opinions on the proposed legislation.

The varying perspectives highlight the complexity and ethical considerations surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>Traditional British television is facing increasing pressure from US streaming giants, leading to discussions about potential mergers and collaborations among UK broadcasters. The shift to digital-only video on demand by 2035 raises concerns about the survival of British-originated and British-focused TV. While some argue for consolidation to compete with well-funded US rivals, others emphasize the importance of maintaining distinctiveness for viewers. The question remains whether British broadcasters can secure their future in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," reveals how former President Biden's aides managed concerns about his mental and physical decline while in office. The book describes instances of Mr. Biden forgetting names, appearing frail, and relying on scripted cabinet meetings. While the book relies heavily on anonymous sources, it underscores the Democratic Party's reluctance to publicly address Mr. Biden's waning abilities. The authors write about a “cover-up,” though their book shows a Biden inner circle that spends more time sticking its collective head in the sand about the president’s diminishing abilities than it does scheming to hide evidence of his shortcomings.</p>
