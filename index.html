          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 23:13:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research and anecdotal evidence suggest that GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, may effectively treat symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients report significant improvements, including weight loss, regulated menstrual cycles, and reduced hormonal imbalances, which are often linked to insulin resistance—a condition these drugs target. However, experts emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm these benefits and address challenges like high costs and inconsistent insurance coverage. The potential for these drugs offers new hope for a condition that has seen little therapeutic innovation in decades.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested following a vehicle crash and subsequent fire at a San Jose post office. The incident, which occurred early Sunday morning, resulted in the building being declared a total loss. Authorities are investigating the crash as a potentially intentional act, though a motive has not been explained. The event brings renewed attention to the Tillman family, known for Pat's celebrated NFL career and his subsequent military service and tragic death by friendly fire in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament, a significant political setback. Despite the defeat, driven by public discontent over inflation and scandals, Ishiba has pledged to remain in his post. He cited the need to lead critical trade negotiations with the United States as his primary reason for not resigning. This electoral result, combined with a previous loss in the lower house, marks a historic low for the LDP party, which now lacks a majority in both houses for the first time since 1955.</p>

          <p>As technological rivalry intensifies between the U.S. and China, a significant divergence is emerging in their approaches to green energy. China is aggressively investing in and expanding its renewable energy infrastructure, partly to power the growing demand from its technology sector, including AI data centers. In contrast, the Trump administration has signaled opposition to tax credits for wind and solar power, framing them as unreliable.

          <p>President Trump has stated he may obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team changes its name back to the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is significant public demand for the name change, a sentiment disputed by Indigenous groups who long campaigned against the name as a racist slur. It remains unclear what authority Trump would have to intervene in the project, as Congress has already given the city control over the proposed stadium site, and the plan is currently under consideration by the D.C.

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 confirmed cases, making it a top global hotspot for the virus. The spread, most prominent in Alberta and Ontario, is largely attributed to declining vaccination rates, particularly within certain communities and fueled by post-pandemic anti-vaccine misinformation. Health officials note that this is the worst outbreak since measles was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998. The situation highlights the severe public health consequences of vaccine hesitancy and the challenges authorities face in containing a highly contagious, yet preventable, disease.</p>

New analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, especially the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on how to boost private savings, as current trends indicate a significant future shortfall. This initiative follows the original commission's success in establishing auto-enrolment, but seeks to tackle the persistent gaps that leave many unprepared for retirement.

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. The shift appears linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, a view held by most Americans outside of Trump's core political base. The poll also reveals widespread public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices and inflation rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Overall, the findings suggest growing public doubt about the administration's priorities, even as his base remains strongly supportive.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to shut down its primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This office is responsible for providing the scientific analysis that underpins environmental regulations on hazards like toxic chemicals, climate change, and water pollution. The administration states the move is part of a broader effort to streamline the agency and save money, while reassigning some scientists to other departments. Critics, however, have condemned the decision as a "travesty" that will cripple the EPA's ability to use the best available science to protect public health and safety.</p>

          <p>During a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously advised the audience to "do your makeup now" before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on large screens. This warning follows a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief, were shown cuddling and quickly separated, sparking affair rumors. The CEO has since resigned from his company following an internal investigation into the matter. Martin's lighthearted comment appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the recent controversy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 children, argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and inner voice. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, allow for age-appropriate autonomy, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence in children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, American companies are navigating a difficult landscape as trade tensions persist between the two nations. While a recent 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, the business community remains concerned that discussions are overly focused on tariffs rather than broader trade issues. Stein notes that while China has taken steps on issues like restricting fentanyl precursors, a reciprocal move from the U.S. to lower tariffs has not yet occurred. This uncertainty creates a precarious environment for American companies operating in or trading with China.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has founded a nonprofit, Better Angels, with the goal of proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. Using a $300-million investment fund, the initiative aims to provide equity to finance projects faster and at a fraction of the cost of traditional, publicly funded developments. Better Angels is currently bidding on several projects, including a 212-unit building in Los Angeles, by supplying upfront capital and using conventional loans. The model seeks to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing sector, potentially creating a new, market-driven solution to the housing crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 trials have faced a major new setback with the cancellation of plea deals for the accused, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for guilty pleas and life sentences, offering a potential path to closure. Legal expert Steve Vladeck explains that this reversal, which overruled a decision by the military court's convening authority, will likely trigger even more litigation and further delay the proceedings. With the case now reverting to years of more pre-trial hearings, the prospect of a final resolution for the nearly 25-year-old case appears more distant than ever.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after being pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metal chain he was wearing around his neck. The man had reportedly entered the MRI room without permission to assist his wife, who had just completed a scan. The powerful magnetic field of the machine attracted the necklace, causing a "medical episode" from which he did not recover. The incident is a tragic reminder of the strict safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic metal object into a dangerous projectile.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has stated that online abuse directed at female players is increasing as the sport's popularity grows. Her comments follow her teammate Jess Carter's revelation of receiving racist messages during the Euro 2025 tournament, which has prompted a police investigation. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football is a significant target online. The Lionesses team has decided to stop taking the knee before games, seeking a new way to combat racism, and continues to use its platform to call for more accountability from social media companies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new watchdog will have legal powers to address issues such as leaky pipes, incorrect billing, and other disputes. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces intense public scrutiny over rising bills and record levels of sewage discharge into waterways. The reform comes as the Environment Secretary described the sector as "broken" and its regulator as "failing," signaling significant changes are forthcoming.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China had positive aspects, actions and rhetoric back home risk sabotaging the progress. The author notes that while Chinese media focused on cooperation, some Australian media and opposition figures framed the visit with suspicion, suggesting China was trying to weaken Australia's U.S. alliance. The article points to the Australian government's stance on the potential sale of the Port of Darwin as a self-defeating move that contradicts efforts to present Australia as a reliable partner for Chinese investment, thereby undermining its own diplomatic goals.</p>
