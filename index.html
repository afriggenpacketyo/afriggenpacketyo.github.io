          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index achieved a new record high, driven by a more than 10% surge in the stock of tech investment giant SoftBank Group. This investor enthusiasm follows a report of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, which has a connection to SoftBank through the U.S. Stargate program. The broader rally in Asian markets reflects positive sentiment from Wall Street, fueled by hopes for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and encouraging inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the starkly different reactions from Donald Trump's supporters regarding various allegations of sexual misconduct against him. It contrasts the widespread outrage directed at Trump's association with Jeffrey Epstein with the general indifference toward the civil court ruling that found him liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll. The author suggests this discrepancy is rooted in a specific brand of misogyny that only values the defense of young, innocent girls while dismissing adult, liberal women as threats. </p>

          <p>The Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium has canceled a scheduled performance by the Munich Philharmonic orchestra due to concerns over its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani. Organizers stated they could not get sufficient clarity on his stance regarding the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, despite Shani having previously advocated for peace.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their purchases of Russian oil, a move intended to further pressure Russia's economy. European officials appear hesitant to adopt this strategy, wary of damaging their own trade relationships with two of Asia's largest economies. Analysts suggest the EU is unlikely to agree, viewing the request as an attempt by the White House to shift responsibility for a stronger sanctions response to Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spain's Socialist-led minority government suffered a legislative defeat when its bill to reduce the standard work week from 40 to 37.5 hours was shelved by the lower house. The opposition, along with the Catalan party Junts, united to block the measure from reaching a full debate. Opponents argued that the policy would impose unsustainable costs on small businesses and farmers, potentially leading to job losses and harming the economy. The defeat highlights the governing coalition's ongoing struggle to pass its reform agenda.</p>

          <h2>Fired Senior FBI Officials Allege Political Retribution in Lawsuit Against Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials who were abruptly fired last month have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were illegally terminated for political reasons. The complaint claims that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents that his own job security depended on firing individuals who had been involved in past investigations related to President Trump. The lawsuit argues that the firings were part of a politically motivated purge directed by the White House to punish law enforcement for doing their jobs.</p>

          <p>The owners of a family-run jewelry store in San José are contemplating closing their business permanently after a traumatic smash-and-grab robbery.

          <p>A new report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) reveals a concerning global trend of democratic decline. The study, which analyzed 173 countries, found that more than half (94) experienced a decline in at least one key democratic indicator between 2019 and 2024. The most significant deteriorations were observed in the areas of credible elections, access to justice, and freedom of the press, which saw its biggest drop in 50 years.</p>

          <p>A real estate analysis by Redfin suggests that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio of July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to a combination of slowing home price growth and rapidly increasing wages, particularly within the tech sector. However, the article cautions that this return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium does not mean the city has become affordable, as housing costs for the typical household remain significantly higher than the national average.
