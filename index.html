          <p>A Russian drone strike targeted a railway station in Shostka, a city in Ukraine's Sumy region, injuring at least 30 people, including three children. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as an act of terrorism, stating that it deliberately targeted civilians as there was no military purpose for the strike. The attack hit two passenger trains while evacuations were underway, leading to intensified calls from Ukraine for its Western allies to provide more advanced air defense systems. This incident is part of a recent escalation in Russian aerial assaults on Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian areas.</p>

Russell's impressive performance marked his first pole since June and Mercedes' first in Singapore since 2018. The qualifying session was tense, with Verstappen attributing his second-place finish to being impeded by McLaren's Lando Norris on his final lap. McLaren's championship leader Oscar Piastri qualified third, positioning himself ahead of his main rival and teammate Norris for the race.</p>

          <p>The right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, has won the parliamentary election in the Czech Republic with 36% of the vote. This victory raises concerns among observers about the future of the country's support for Ukraine and its relationship with the European Union. Babis, who has campaigned on a "Czech first" platform and opposes military aid to Kyiv, may align the country with more defiant EU members like Hungary and Slovakia. The result signals a potential shift in the region's political landscape, moving away from the pro-Western stance of the previous government.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official, Anthony Salisbury, accidentally revealed plans to deploy the elite 82nd Airborne Division to Portland, Oregon, through messages on the Signal app that were seen in a public setting. The messages indicated that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sought direct orders from President Trump for the deployment, likely to have political cover for using a top-tier military unit domestically. This incident marks the latest in a series of embarrassing intelligence leaks from the Trump administration. The White House confirmed the official was traveling for personal reasons but defended his continued work, dismissing the reporting as morally bankrupt.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 reaching its 29th record high of the year despite an ongoing federal government shutdown. Analysts and investors appear to view the shutdown as a temporary non-event for the market, focusing instead on positive corporate earnings and sector-specific news. The healthcare and technology sectors performed particularly well, boosted by a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs and continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.

          <p>South Africa's national rugby team, the Springboks, won their second consecutive Rugby Championship title by defeating Argentina 29-27 in a decisive match. The victory was secured after New Zealand's earlier win over Australia set the stage for South Africa to claim the championship with any form of win. Despite a strong start from Argentina, the world champion Springboks demonstrated their dominance in the second half. The match, played in London to a large crowd, concluded a successful tournament for South Africa, which recovered from early losses to win their final three games.</p>

          <p>Israel has deported 137 international activists to Turkey after intercepting a large aid flotilla attempting to break the maritime blockade of Gaza. The flotilla, which included prominent figures like Greta Thunberg, was targeted by Israeli forces in international waters, an action condemned by world leaders. The detentions have sparked massive protests across Europe, with millions participating in demonstrations and strikes supporting the Palestinian cause. This event unfolds as Hamas has reportedly agreed to parts of a ceasefire deal proposed by U.S. President Trump, signaling potential, albeit fragile, progress in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat with green olives and pimentos, has largely vanished from American stores after peaking in popularity from the 1940s to the 1970s. Initially valued for its affordability and visual appeal compared to bologna, its decline began as consumer preferences shifted towards healthier, less-processed foods. Growing concerns about sodium and preservatives, combined with the rise of the low-fat craze and microwaveable meals, pushed olive loaf into obscurity. While it holds a nostalgic place for some, experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a major rebranding to appeal to modern tastes.</p>

Under the plan, Gaza would be managed by a technocratic government overseen by a "Board of Peace," with Blair potentially playing a leading part. This prospect has drawn sharp criticism from Palestinian leaders and others, who cite Blair's controversial role in the 2003 Iraq War and his perceived pro-Israel bias during his time as Middle East envoy. Despite his contentious history in the region, Blair has described the Trump plan as "bold and intelligent."</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Pentagon's civilian leadership. Harrison's removal follows reports that he and the Navy Secretary had sought to limit the influence and budgetary role of the incoming Navy Under Secretary. This firing is the latest event in a period of significant upheaval within the military's top ranks under Hegseth, who has overseen the dismissal of numerous high-ranking generals and admirals. The move signals ongoing friction and power struggles within the Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" public arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. According to sources, an agent who refused to participate in the plan, viewing it as inappropriate for a white-collar defendant, has been suspended for insubordination. The indictment and potential public arrest are seen as an escalation of the long-standing feud between Comey and President Trump, who has publicly pressured the Justice Department to investigate his adversary. The move raises serious concerns about the politicization of federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Newly elected Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was unable to be sworn into office this week by House Speaker Mike Johnson. Grijalva believes the delay is a political tactic to prevent her from casting the final, decisive vote on a discharge petition that would force a House vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The petition, opposed by Speaker Johnson and former President Trump, needs just one more signature to succeed. A spokesperson for Johnson indicated Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is currently stalled by the government shutdown.</p>

          <p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with crimes related to their pregnancies, according to new research. Most cases involve allegations of substance use and disproportionately affect low-income women, with prosecutors often using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals' behavior. Critics warn this approach worsens health outcomes and draws parallels to the highly restrictive and punitive systems in countries like El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has emerged as a powerful dissenting voice, using her written opinions to issue stark warnings about threats to the rule of law in the United States. In a notable dissent against a ruling that expanded presidential power, she cited a historical analysis of Nazi Germany's legal system to draw a parallel with the current erosion of legal checks and balances. Her forceful dissents on issues like voting rights and executive overreach are seen as a direct message to the American public and lower courts about the dangers facing the nation's democratic institutions under the current Supreme Court majority.</p>

These emails serve as a digital time capsule, capturing birthdays, small memories, funny quotes, and even reflections during difficult parenting moments. The expert suggests this practice is a powerful way to build a legacy of love and connection that the children can access when they are older.

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early.

In a film accompanying her album release, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," finding it flattering that someone would devote so much attention to her.

While the plant is increasing production by 15%, industry leaders warn that the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, from mining to conversion, needs to expand to support ambitious government and tech sector goals for new reactor construction.

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party is gathering for its annual conference facing a profound crisis of relevance and popularity, with polls showing its standing has fallen further since its major election defeat. The party, now in opposition under leader Kemi Badenoch, is struggling to gain traction against the Labour government and is losing support to the right-wing Reform UK party. Internal critics question Badenoch's leadership and strategy, arguing the party has failed to define itself or connect with voters. The conference is seen as a critical moment for the party to demonstrate it has a clear direction and still matters in British politics.</p>
