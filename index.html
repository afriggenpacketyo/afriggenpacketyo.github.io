          <p>The British and Irish Lions have named their team for the upcoming match against the Brumbies, with Maro Itoje returning to the role of captain. This lineup is widely seen as a strong indicator of the starting team for the first Test against the Wallabies. Key selections include Blair Kinghorn at full-back, a midfield partnership of Garry Ringrose and Bundee Aki, and a formidable front row of Ellis Genge, Dan Sheehan, and Tadhg Furlong. The selection provides insight into coach Andy Farrell's strategy as the crucial Test series approaches.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any point during a pregnancy. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will provide people with necessary time to grieve without worrying about work. This move has been praised by campaigners and MPs as a significant step in recognizing all forms of pregnancy loss as a true bereavement.</p>

          <p>A specialized team of 14 engineers from the United Kingdom has arrived in Kerala, India, to assess and repair a technologically advanced F-35B fighter jet. The aircraft has been stranded at an airport for over three weeks after it was diverted due to bad weather and subsequently experienced a technical failure. The prolonged grounding of the $110 million stealth jet has generated considerable local curiosity and online humor. If the new engineering team is unable to make the aircraft airworthy, it will need to be dismantled for transport.</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology to China, a move expected to significantly benefit the production of China's homegrown C919 passenger aircraft. This agreement allows the state-owned manufacturer COMAC to import critical components, enabling it to fulfill hundreds of existing orders for its narrowbody jet. While analysts see this as crucial for COMAC's market ambitions, they also suggest that previous US restrictions have likely strengthened China's resolve to develop its own indigenous engine technology for the future.</p>

          <h2>Breakthrough Gene Therapy Injection Reverses Genetic Hearing Loss in Clinical Trial</h2>

          <p>A new clinical trial has shown that a single injection of a breakthrough gene therapy can reverse a specific type of genetic hearing loss within weeks. The therapy, which delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear, resulted in considerable hearing improvement for all 10 participants, who suffered from congenital deafness or severe impairment. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with researchers expressing confidence that this method could eventually be adapted to treat other common genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to send letters to its trading partners detailing new tariff rates, but significant confusion remains over when they will take effect. While a 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire this week, officials have given conflicting signals, with some suggesting a new effective date of August 1. This uncertainty, coupled with a new threat of an additional 10% tariff on countries aligning with BRICS, has created an extended period of unpredictability for global markets and importers.

          <p>Campaigners, charities, and parents in the UK are urging ministers not to abolish Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs and disabilities. They argue these legally binding plans are "precious legal protections" and that removing them could deny thousands of children access to vital support or education altogether. The government has not ruled out scrapping the plans, stating it is reforming a "failed" system, but critics accuse it of creating uncertainty for vulnerable families.</p>

          <p>A major scandal is unfolding in South Africa after a high-ranking provincial police commissioner accused the national Police Minister, Senzo Mchunu, of interfering in investigations into political assassinations. The commissioner alleged that Mchunu and other senior officials obstructed police work to shield politically connected individuals. President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the matter as one of "grave national security concern," and there are widespread calls from opposition parties for an urgent independent commission of inquiry into the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes on three ports and a power plant in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. Israel stated the attacks were part of "Operation Black Flag" and were a response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel and maritime vessels in the Red Sea. The targeted ports were allegedly being used to transfer weapons from Iran. Following the strikes, the Houthis confirmed they confronted the attack with surface-to-air missiles, and sirens were triggered in Israel in response to missiles launched from Yemen.</p>

          <p>A research team from Fuzhou University in China has created a novel visual sensor that can adapt to extreme changes in light intensity in mere seconds, faster than the human eye. The system utilizes semiconductor "quantum dots" to mimic and improve upon the human visual system's adaptive capabilities. According to the scientists, this breakthrough technology not only provides rapid adaptation but also enables faster computation with lower energy consumption compared to existing vision systems, opening new possibilities for advanced imaging.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, author Jessie Cole explores her lifelong relationship with her younger brother, who spoke very little as a child, leading her to act as his interpreter. She reflects on how, after experiencing profound family tragedy, he found his true voice not in words but through the expressive language of music. His instrumental songs became a powerful medium for his emotions and history, allowing him to communicate his unique story in a way that she, a writer, has learned to listen to and understand.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in central Texas, questions are being raised about whether local officials and the National Weather Service did enough to warn people of the impending danger. Some officials have defended their actions, pointing to the unprecedented nature of the deluge and the limitations of warning systems in rural areas with poor cell coverage. However, critics and former weather officials have noted potential staffing shortages and the impact of budget cuts on forecasting capabilities, sparking a debate over the disaster response.</p>

          <p>Mexico has won the Gold Cup for a record 10th time, defeating the host nation United States 2-1 in a contentious final in Houston. West Ham's Edson Álvarez scored the decisive goal in the second half for El Tri. The match was not without controversy, as US coach Mauricio Pochettino was incensed by a denied penalty call, which he called an "embarrassing" decision that he suggested was influenced by the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd. The loss ends an uneven but promising tournament for a second-choice US squad.</p>
