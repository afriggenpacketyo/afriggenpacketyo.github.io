          <h2>Trump Jokes About Canadians Electing Him as 51st U.S. State</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the day of Canada's election, former President Donald Trump suggested in a social media post that Canadians should vote for him to make Canada the 51st state, promising tax cuts and increased military power. He criticized the U.S. for subsidizing Canada and stated it only makes sense if Canada becomes a state. Canadian political leaders swiftly responded, asserting Canada's sovereignty and independence, with Liberal leader Mark Carney posting a video affirming Canada's decision-making power. Despite Trump's suggestion, he is not on the ballot in the Canadian election. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>Experts predict that home equity loan rates will remain steady in the near term due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to further rate cuts. Rates may drop later in the year if the Fed implements projected rate cuts. HELOCs may be a better deal due to lower rates, but borrowers should be cautious of variable interest rates and the potential for higher long-term interest costs. Consumers should explore their options and understand the terms before tapping into their home equity. (not investment advice)</p>
