          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will prioritize long-term growth and investments in AI model training, even if it means operating at a loss for a considerable time. Following the release of GPT-5, Altman emphasized that as long as the models continue to improve significantly, it is rational to focus on spending rather than short-term profitability. This strategy is feasible because OpenAI remains a private company, free from public market pressures, and is currently in talks for a new stock sale at a valuation of around $500 billion.</p>

          <p>Shares of the salad chain Sweetgreen fell by over 25% after the company significantly lowered its 2025 financial outlook for the second consecutive quarter.

          <p>Former President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new census method that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official population count. This move faces significant hurdles, as the Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons for congressional apportionment, and the Census Bureau's processes are planned years in advance. The proposal revives a similar effort from Trump's first term to add a citizenship question, which was blocked by the Supreme Court, and raises concerns about potential undercounts of minority populations.</p>

The bus company, Stagecoach, and the local NHS trust expressed their condolences and are cooperating with the ongoing police investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found compelling evidence of a giant gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet orbits a Sun-like star, making it an exciting discovery. Although the gas giant itself would be uninhabitable, astronomers believe it could have moons capable of sustaining life. The planet was detected once but was not visible in follow-up observations, so further confirmation is needed to prove its existence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of England's second-tier football league, the Championship, reveals a remarkably high rate of managerial turnover. Of the 18 teams that competed in the league last season and remain, only one—Portsmouth's John Mousinho—still has the same manager in place from the start of the previous season. This stark figure highlights the "brutal" and high-pressure nature of the league, where results are paramount. The article details the numerous changes, with many clubs opting for new leadership ahead of the new season.</p>

          <h2>Ohio Planned Parenthood Affiliate to Stop Accepting Medicaid Amid Uncertainty Over Federal Funding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Planned Parenthood affiliate in Southwest Ohio has announced it will no longer accept Medicaid insurance due to legal uncertainty surrounding potential Trump administration funding cuts. The decision stems from fears that if a court injunction protecting Medicaid reimbursements is overturned, the administration could attempt to "claw back" payments already made. This move highlights the operational challenges faced by abortion providers, with another Ohio affiliate also halting the provision of long-acting contraceptives to Medicaid patients for similar financial risk reasons.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals significant voter indecision in California regarding both the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, Democrat Katie Porter leads with 18%, but a large 38% of voters remain undecided. Similarly, when asked about a proposed mid-decade redistricting effort, which Democrats are considering to counter GOP moves in other states, 42% of voters were unsure, indicating a lack of public engagement on these key political issues so far.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted" in a post on Truth Social.

          <p>Top global insurers like Allianz and Zurich are warning that the escalating climate crisis threatens to make entire regions uninsurable, which could destabilize the global economy. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, the financial risk may become too great to cover, potentially impacting everything from home mortgages to investments. An Allianz board member noted that the world is on a climate trajectory where adaptation is no longer feasible, creating a societal problem as the gap between economic losses and insured coverage widens.</p>

          <p>Bao Fan, the founder of investment bank China Renaissance, has reportedly been released more than two years after his sudden disappearance, during which he was said to be cooperating with a government investigation.

While he has since resigned from his executive roles, he remains the company's controlling shareholder, and news of his release caused a significant surge in the company's stock price.</p>
