          <p>Taylor Swift announced she has bought back the masters of her first six studio albums, which were previously sold to Scooter Braun in 2019 and later to Shamrock Capital. The pop star expressed immense joy at owning her music outright, fulfilling a long-held aspiration. Swift also revealed that she has completed rerecording her debut album and is contemplating releasing vault tracks from "Reputation," an album she initially felt couldn't be improved upon. This move marks a significant victory for Swift, granting her full autonomy over her early discography and allowing her to control the narrative around her music.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This attack came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled most of Trump's tariffs illegal, sparking the former President's ire. Trump also expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, alleging they provided poor judicial nomination advice. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of federal courts, emphasizing the importance of the work done. This public disagreement highlights a rift between Trump and figures who were once key allies in shaping the judiciary.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its COVID-19 vaccine guidance, stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine rather than issuing a broad recommendation.

The CDC still recommends the vaccine for immunocompromised children and most adults, and maintains that vaccination during pregnancy is safe and beneficial. These changes reflect ongoing discussions about the evolving risk profile of COVID-19 and the appropriate vaccination strategies for different populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores to mitigate the impact of high borrowing costs. Switching to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidating debt with a lower-rate personal loan can significantly reduce interest payments. Additionally, moving funds to a high-yield savings account can provide better returns before rates potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found that two New York state agencies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act with their ban on Native American-inspired mascots and logos. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA), which argued that the state agencies forced Massapequa School District to retire its mascot. The Department of Education also found the policy to be discriminatory as it did not permit Native American-inspired mascots while allowing others derived from different racial or ethnic groups. The proposed resolution includes rescinding the ban and issuing apology letters to Indigenous tribes.</p>

          <p>Bloodhounds are being used to track Grant Hardin, a convicted killer who escaped from a prison in Arkansas, but heavy rain has hampered the search. The bloodhound initially picked up Hardin's scent, but the trail was lost due to the weather conditions. Hardin, a former police chief, was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and has a history of evading law enforcement. The FBI is offering a reward for information leading to his arrest, and authorities are investigating how Hardin was able to escape.</p>

While home prices have risen and equity levels have surged, borrowing against your home can be risky. Experts advise only borrowing an amount that can be comfortably repaid, considering the potential impact of market conditions, interest rates, and inflation. Homeowners should calculate monthly payment costs for both home equity loans and HELOCs, evaluating short- and long-term affordability to ensure financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK is unlikely to reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers, according to a campaign group. The ban, set to take effect on Sunday, aims to curb youth vaping rates and reduce electronic waste. However, Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) argues that new reusable vapes are too similar to disposables, maintaining their appeal. The government's Tobacco and Vapes Bill may bring stronger regulations, such as regulating packaging and restricting advertising, to further deter young people.</p>

This cultural shift has led to increased estrangement between adult children and parents, contributing to millennials having the highest rate of childlessness in American history.
