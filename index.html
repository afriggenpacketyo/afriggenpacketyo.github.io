          <p>A violent confrontation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank resulted in the deaths of two young Palestinian men, one of whom was a U.S. citizen visiting from Florida. Family members and residents allege the men were attacked and lynched by a group of Israeli settlers, who then obstructed efforts to provide medical aid. The incident has prompted calls for a U.S. State Department investigation and highlights the escalating settler violence in the region since the conflict in Gaza began. The Israel Defense Forces stated a violent confrontation occurred and that the incident is under investigation.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Senator Rand Paul discussed his committee's report on the assassination attempt against President Trump, describing a "cascade of errors" and a "cultural cover-up" within the Secret Service. He alleges that the former director was untruthful to Congress about resource denials and that multiple requests for enhanced security, including counter-snipers, were rejected prior to the event. Paul criticized the lack of accountability, noting that no one was fired for the security lapses that day. He also touched on proposed federal spending cuts, arguing they are necessary despite potential impacts on public broadcasting.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on deporting dangerous criminals, an analysis of government data reveals a different reality for the administration's immigration enforcement. As of late June, over 71% of people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have no criminal convictions. While arrests have increased, data shows the majority of detainees are classified with "no ICE threat level," challenging the narrative that enforcement primarily targets violent offenders. Critics argue this disconnect between rhetoric and reality fuels fear in immigrant communities, while the administration maintains it is focused on public safety.</p>

The research delves into what is clinically known as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, examining how many people are affected and the intensity of their symptoms. This new data contributes to an ongoing and often contentious debate among doctors and patients about the challenges of stopping these widely prescribed drugs and how best to manage the process to minimize adverse effects.</p>

          <p>A government official in Spain's Murcia region has stated that an outbreak of violence between residents and migrants in the town of Torre Pacheco was fueled by social media posts from far-right groups. The disturbance, which left five people with minor injuries, allegedly stemmed from calls for a "hunt for migrants" following an earlier assault on an elderly man. For a second night, groups armed with batons roamed the streets, leading to clashes where objects were thrown and barricades were set on fire. Authorities have appealed for calm and are investigating potential hate crimes.</p>

          <p>Amid geopolitical tensions and trade disputes with China, the recycling of electronic waste is emerging as a crucial strategy for the U.S. to secure a domestic supply of rare earth metals and other critical materials. Next-generation recycling companies are developing innovative ways to extract valuable elements like neodymium, copper, and lithium from discarded electronics such as laptops, phones, and EV batteries. This "urban mining" reduces reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from China which dominates the market, and aligns with efforts to onshore production of vital technological components.

          <p>A feature article details the rise of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that has revolutionized solving cold cases by using public DNA databases to build family trees of unknown suspects. The story highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a patent attorney whose hobby led her to identify the Golden State Killer. This method, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogical research, has since been used to solve dozens of violent crimes, though it also raises complex questions about genetic privacy and the use of personal data by law enforcement.</p>

The Ingram Fire Department ordered all search teams to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor, citing a high potential for more life-threatening flash floods as additional rain falls on the already devastated region. The destructive floodwaters, which rose with unprecedented speed, have left a trail of destruction, particularly at youth camps and vacation homes along the river.

They warn that such baseless claims are actively harmful, as they erode public trust in science and distract from the real factors contributing to extreme weather events, such as climate change.</p>
