        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Total mortgage application volume in the United States decreased by 1.2% last week, breaking a four-week streak of gains. This downturn occurred even as the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate fell to its lowest point since April. While refinancing applications saw a minor increase, applications for home purchases dropped by 3%, indicating that housing affordability remains a significant barrier for potential buyers. Economic reports, particularly the upcoming monthly employment data, are expected to influence future mortgage rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a recent visit to China, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed support for President Xi Jinping's vision for a multipolar global order. Anwar's backing of the Global Governance Initiative highlights Malaysia's alignment with China's strategic goals, which emphasize sovereign equality and multilateralism. This move signals a strengthening of ties between the two nations and reflects Malaysia's solidarity with the Global South in response to what it perceives as unilateralism from Washington. The diplomatic gesture underscores a broader trend of shifting geopolitical allegiances in Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>A registered dietitian suggests that certain carbohydrates rich in protein can aid in weight loss and muscle development, challenging the common perception of carbs as detrimental to fitness goals. Foods such as quinoa, sprouted grain bread, whole wheat pasta, chickpeas, and lentils are highlighted for their protein and fiber content. These options can help individuals meet higher protein intake targets, manage blood sugar levels, and maintain steady energy. The article emphasizes that incorporating these nutrient-dense carbs can be a practical strategy for achieving a balanced and effective diet.</p>

Prosecutors dropped the charge after it was revealed that a security guard had given the man permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic chance of conviction because dishonesty could not be proven. The tributes were left by thousands of fans following the heavy metal icon's death in July at the age of 76.</p>

This article reveals that such discrepancies are common, as UCLA's official count includes non-ticketed individuals like staff and media.

          <p>The British Embassy in Cairo has temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed the concrete security barriers that had surrounded the compound for decades. The move comes amid rising diplomatic tensions between Egypt and several Western nations over pro-Palestinian protests targeting Egyptian missions abroad. Egyptian officials have accused host countries of failing to provide adequate security for their embassies. The removal of the barriers in Cairo appears to be a reciprocal action following these disputes and the recent detention of a pro-government Egyptian activist in London.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly crossed the 5% threshold, reflecting investor anxiety over several economic and political factors. Markets are reacting to a recent court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal, which could lead to substantial government refunds. Additionally, concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve are contributing to market jitters, with fears that political interference could undermine the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility. Investors are now closely watching upcoming jobs data for further signals on the economy's direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House Oversight Committee has released more than 33,000 pages of documents from the Department of Justice related to the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release, which includes old court filings and police footage, follows months of controversy surrounding the Trump administration's refusal to make additional files public. While the newly released documents do not appear to contain significant new revelations, the action represents a step toward transparency demanded by lawmakers and victims' advocates. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.</p>

He emphasized that the government wants police to prioritize street crime over "policing tweets."

          <p>The location of Adolf Hitler's Führerbunker in Berlin, now a nondescript parking lot, attracts a steady stream of tourists despite having no visible remains. This phenomenon, known as "dark tourism," involves visiting sites associated with death and tragedy. For decades, German authorities resisted officially marking the site, fearing it could become a neo-Nazi shrine. In 2006, a historical association installed a single informational plaque to provide context and counter misinformation. The site's understated nature reflects Germany's ongoing, complex struggle with how to publicly commemorate the darkest parts of its history.</p>

She faces the difficult task of balancing spending commitments with her self-imposed fiscal rules, which require day-to-day spending to be funded by taxes and aim to lower national debt.

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, Caltrans has proposed a $2.1 billion tunnel as a long-term solution for Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101 in Northern California. This highway is the only viable route connecting the remote community of Crescent City to the rest of the state, making it a critical economic lifeline. The road is built atop four active landslides and is constantly eroding, posing a severe risk to travelers. If funding is secured, the 6,000-foot tunnel would be the state's longest and could open by 2038.</p>
