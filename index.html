          <p>A House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while negatively impacting low-income households. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bottom 10% of households would see a 2% income decrease in 2027 and a 4% decrease in 2033, while the top 10% would experience a 4% increase in 2027 and a 2% increase in 2033. The bill includes tax cuts for businesses, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, offset by reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The article points out that many low earners would be worse off.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after Donald Trump proposed a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., which sent investors seeking safety in bonds. Trump's remarks followed concerns that his budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which had previously pushed the 30-year Treasury yield to levels not seen since 2023. This article also notes that Moody's downgraded the U.S.' credit rating late last week, citing the growing budget deficit and the cost of funding the existing debt.</p>

While Apple has shifted some production to India, most iPhones are still made in China, due to factors like a skilled workforce and established supply chains. Experts suggest that making iPhones in the U.S. would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling the price, and that the company had a bad experience when it began assembling Mac desktop computers in the United States in 2013.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to revoke the university's ability to enroll foreign students. The university argues that the move is a violation of the U.S. Constitution and a retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily blocking the policy from coming into effect.</p>
