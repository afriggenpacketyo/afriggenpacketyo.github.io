          <p>Former Playboy playmates Karissa and Kristina Shannon, now 35, discussed their experiences living in Hugh Hefner's mansion, describing it as traumatic and contributing to substance abuse issues. They detailed feelings of jealousy from other playmates and the impact of Hefner's influence on their religious beliefs. After leaving the mansion, the twins struggled with individuality, weight gain, and substance abuse, eventually moving back to Michigan to prioritize their mental and physical health.

Pierre Poilievre, known for his confrontational style and advocacy for a small government, leads the Conservatives. The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, are also key players influencing the election's outcome.</p>

The violations included rocket and mortar attacks that killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters, exacerbating the ongoing civil war. Civilians attempting to return home during the ceasefire were targeted, highlighting the junta's disregard for the agreement.

Glasnow had previously undergone Tommy John surgery in 2021 and his absence adds to the Dodgers' pitching concerns, as Blake Snell is already on the injured list with left-shoulder inflammation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers addressed several needs in the NFL draft, focusing on bolstering their offense with skill position players around quarterback Justin Herbert. However, the offensive line remains a potential concern, as the team only drafted one rookie prospect, Branson Taylor. The Chargers' general manager, Joe Hortiz, emphasized the importance of competition and versatility among the players. The team hopes that the additions to the offense and defense will contribute to a successful season and a potential Super Bowl run.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will no longer recognize Indigenous Peoples Day alongside Columbus Day, reversing a practice initiated by his predecessor, Joe Biden. Trump accused Democrats of undermining Christopher Columbus's legacy and the Italian-American community's appreciation for him. Columbus Day will be the sole recognition, a move that aligns with Trump's opposition to viewing American history through the lens of diversity and oppression. The decision sparked controversy, as it disregards the historical exploitation of indigenous peoples.</p>
