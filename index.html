          <p>David Huerta, president of SEIU California, faces a felony conspiracy charge for allegedly interfering with law enforcement during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. According to court documents, Huerta is accused of blocking a gate to an ICE staging ground and resisting officers' attempts to move him, leading to his arrest and hospitalization due to injuries. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while SEIU officials held a protest in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release. If convicted, Huerta could face up to six years in federal prison. </p>

          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us". Baldoni's suit alleged Lively aimed to ruin his career by falsely accusing him of sexual assault and initiating a smear campaign. The judge ruled Baldoni failed to adequately prove extortion or defamation, and that evidence did not show the New York Times acted with malice in publishing the story. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a victory, while Baldoni can amend allegations related to contract interference by June 23. </p>

This move follows other changes made by Kennedy that undermine vaccinations, such as halting routine COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women.

The program depends on the passage of a massive budget bill, which the CBO found would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs.
