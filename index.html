          <p>President Trump has announced an additional 10% tariff on Canadian goods in response to an anti-tariff advertisement aired by Ontario, featuring Ronald Reagan's criticism of tariffs. Trump called the advertisement a "fraud" and criticized Ontario officials for allowing it to run during the World Series. Ontario's Premier Ford had stated the ad would be paused on Monday to allow trade talks to resume, however, Trump claimed the ad should have been taken down immediately. Trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have persisted for months, despite the USMCA. Optimism around resolving the trade dispute remains low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Lottery's Saturday evening Lotto draw was halted due to a "technical fault" where the bonus ball failed to drop. The operator, Allwyn, paused the draw and planned to resume it with an alternative machine under independent supervision. Viewers noticed the program abruptly cut off after the bonus ball malfunctioned. Allwyn, which took over from Camelot in 2024, apologized for the delay and expected to publish verified results later that evening. The incident raised concerns about the reliability of the lottery system. </p>

          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent left-wing politician, has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland after a landslide victory over Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. Connolly, backed by major left-wing parties, pledged to be an inclusive president and a voice for peace. She secured a historic number of first-preference votes. Her campaign was characterized as a "movement" and garnered attention, especially from younger voters, due to her composed style and social media presence. Connolly's victory signifies a shift in Irish politics, with many viewing her as an anti-establishment figure.</p>

          <p>Tom Aspinall's first defense of his undisputed heavyweight title at UFC 321 ended prematurely after an accidental eye poke from Ciryl Gane. The referee stopped the fight when Aspinall could not continue due to impaired vision. Aspinall expressed his frustration at the outcome, while Gane apologized to the fans and Aspinall. The fight was considered a no contest, allowing Aspinall to retain his title, though the incident has raised questions about the future of the heavyweight division and the need for clearer rules regarding eye pokes. </p>

          <p>Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory, has been ranked the safest destination in the Caribbean by World Population Review, citing low crime rates. The island is praised for its tranquil atmosphere, calm beaches, and world-class food scene. The U.S. Department of State also lists Anguilla at a Level 1 travel advisory, advising normal precautions. Experts attribute Anguilla's safety to its isolation, limited access points, and controlled tourism environment, making it an appealing choice for travelers prioritizing safety and relaxation.

          <p>China is experiencing a surge in foreclosures, with online platforms showing a growing number of distressed properties being auctioned at discounted prices. An industry report indicated that properties in judicial auctions were selling for an average of 77% of their appraised value in the first half of 2024. Experts estimate that the number of foreclosures could exceed 1 million this year, with some suggesting the total number of foreclosed units has already surpassed 4 million. These developments have sparked concerns about a potential housing crisis reminiscent of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The shift reflects a search for alternative investment strategies amid changing market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>
