          <p>Plans for a significant rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire have been cancelled by the company Pensana, which will now pursue investment in the United States. The project was intended to process materials from a new mine in Angola, giving the UK a strategic position in an industry dominated by China. Pensana's chairman stated that the UK government's financial support was insufficient, contrasting it with the more substantial investment and price guarantees offered by the US government for a similar facility.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has condemned the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The ban was advised by a local safety group and supported by West Midlands Police, who cited public safety concerns and past incidents of violence involving the club's fans. The move has drawn criticism from political leaders who argue it sends a message that Jewish fans are not safe, while others have defended it as a necessary precaution.</p>

          <p>Three major labor unions have sued the Trump administration, alleging that a program monitoring the social media of visa holders violates First Amendment rights. The lawsuit claims the government uses AI to search for specific viewpoints, including criticism of U.S. and Israeli policy, to revoke visas, creating a chilling effect on free speech. The administration maintains that foreigners do not have the same constitutional protections and that the measures are necessary to screen for anti-American sentiment and security threats.</p>

          <p>U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology is set to stop supplying server memory chips to data centers in mainland China. This decision follows a 2023 Chinese government ban on its products in critical infrastructure, from which the business has not recovered. The move is seen as a consequence of the escalating tech tensions between Washington and Beijing. Micron will, however, continue to sell chips to China's automotive and smartphone sectors, as well as to Chinese companies with data center operations located outside the country.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has stated that cafes and food delivery apps are now significant rivals for consumers' leisure time and spending. With a growing number of people, especially younger generations, not drinking alcohol, pubs must adapt to changing social trends. The company is responding by improving its coffee offerings, creating more comfortable food-led environments, and exploring "competitive socialising" activities to attract a wider customer base and remain relevant in the evolving hospitality market.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish direct export channels for its fresh durians to China, aiming to significantly increase profits by cutting out intermediaries in countries like Malaysia and Thailand. Currently, these neighboring countries assist Indonesian growers with cold-chain logistics and phytosanitary approvals required by Chinese customs. By improving its own certification and refrigeration infrastructure, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the massive Chinese durian market, which consumes over 90% of global production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature highlights a severe environmental threat facing Shanghai, as the city is both sinking and experiencing rapidly rising sea levels. Researchers attribute at least 94% of the urban subsidence to human activities, with local sinking rates often exceeding the global average sea-level rise. As a city built on soft delta sediment, Shanghai is naturally prone to sinking, but man-made factors have drastically accelerated the process, compounding the risks posed by climate change.</p>
