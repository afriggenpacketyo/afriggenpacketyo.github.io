          <p>Marius Borg HÃ¸iby, the son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been officially charged with multiple serious offenses, including several counts of sexual assault and bodily harm. The charges follow a months-long investigation involving what Oslo police described as a "double-digit" number of alleged victims. HÃ¸iby, who is 28 and holds no official royal role, has cooperated with police but denies wrongdoing in most cases, especially those regarding sexual abuse. He remains free pending a potential trial, and the royal palace has not commented on the matter.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have indicted a Syrian teenager for allegedly supporting a foiled terrorist plot targeting a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. The teen is accused of assisting an Austrian suspect by translating a bomb-making manual and connecting him with an "Islamic State" member. He also allegedly provided a template for an oath of allegiance to the terrorist group. The planned attack, which involved driving a car with explosives into the crowd, led to the cancellation of Swift's Vienna concerts in August 2024. The Berlin court will now decide whether to proceed with a trial.</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2% in May, bringing the annual rate to 2.7%. This figure was slightly higher than economists' expectations, indicating persistent inflationary pressures even as other data shows signs of a weakening economy. The report also noted a 0.1% decline in consumer spending and a 0.4% drop in personal income, creating a complex picture for the Fed.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has launched an investigation into the University of California system for potential discrimination in its hiring practices. The probe focuses on whether the university's "UC 2030 Capacity Plan" violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by directing campuses to meet race- and sex-based employment quotas. The DOJ alleges these diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives constitute unlawful discrimination. The university has stated it is committed to fair processes and will cooperate with the investigation, having recently dropped mandatory diversity statements from hiring.</p>

          <p>A new 30-meter giant slide at a popular tourist spot in Kitakyushu, Japan, has been temporarily shut down after four people, including a toddler and a tourist, sustained broken bones while using it.

Local officials believe some incidents may be due to users not adhering to the recommended age range of 6 to 12 or other posted safety warnings.

          <p>This article explores the potential returns of investing $10,000 in a three-year certificate of deposit (CD) in the current economic climate. With top rates for this term hovering around 4.15%, savers could earn nearly $1,300 in guaranteed interest over the 36-month period. The piece contrasts this with the variable rates of money market accounts, suggesting that locking in a fixed CD rate now could be advantageous as the Federal Reserve considers future rate cuts. It emphasizes that while long-term CDs offer predictable growth, savers must be certain they won't need the funds early to avoid penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing body of scientific research indicates that exposure to wildfire smoke poses significant and potentially long-lasting health risks, extending far beyond immediate respiratory issues. Studies have shown that smoke exposure can lead to a delayed deterioration in lung function, potential reproductive harm, and an increased risk of neurological disorders and premature death. Researchers emphasize that wildfire smoke is chemically distinct and likely more toxic than typical urban air pollution. As climate change intensifies wildfires, scientists warn of a looming public health crisis and are racing to understand the cumulative effects of repeated smoke inhalation.</p>

Cramer noted that while he believes the company's turnaround under CEO Bob Iger is ongoing, the principle of 'discipline trumps conviction' necessitates taking some profits off the table after a successful period.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a 'genetic switch' that could potentially enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited to animals like salamanders. Their research, published in the journal Science, found that mice fail to regenerate because they cannot produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a specific gene responsible for this acid's production, the scientists were able to trigger ear tissue regeneration in a mouse. The researchers believe this discovery could play a significant role in advancing regenerative medicine for various tissue types in vertebrates.</p>

While Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, his deal is rumored to contain exit clauses. The speculation is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and upcoming major regulation changes in 2026, which could make Mercedes a more competitive option. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are being influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the four-time champion, adding a significant layer of intrigue to the driver market.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally launched his bid for reelection, positioning himself as a blue-collar leader with a record of reducing crime and creating jobs. Adams, who is now running as an independent, contrasted his experience with that of his chief rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani, whom he labeled an inexperienced socialist with "empty promises." The announcement comes after a challenging first term for Adams, marked by a federal investigation and criticism over his policies. The general election will see Adams face Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa in November.</p>

          <p>The Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has concluded a national "consultation" that it claims shows overwhelming public opposition to Ukraine's EU accession.

While the government announced that 95% of the 2.27 million participants voted against Ukraine's membership, the results cannot be independently verified. The move has been condemned by Ukrainian officials and Hungarian intellectuals as a manipulative tactic to divert attention from domestic issues and has caused irreparable damage to bilateral relations.</p>

Slotkin argued the party is split between those who see the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as merely survivable.

There is also concern for political prisoners, with reports that inmates from Tehran's Evin prison have been moved to unknown locations.

          <p>The once-ubiquitous hotel minibar, a symbol of travel convenience in the late 20th century, has largely disappeared from midscale hotels. The concept, which began at a Hong Kong Hilton in 1974, proved to be a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, food spoilage, and theft. By the early 2000s, major chains began phasing them out. In their place, hotels have shifted to more modern and efficient alternatives, such as 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps like DoorDash and Grubhub to provide guests with food and beverage options.</p>

          <h2>Despite Recent Breakthroughs, Practical Quantum Computing Remains a Distant Goal</h2>

          <p>Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM are investing heavily in quantum computing, with recent announcements touting significant progress in chip development and error correction. However, the technology is still in a purely research phase, with no current practical applications that can't be done on traditional computers. The primary known use case is its potential to break current encryption methods, prompting a national security race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography. Experts believe a truly useful quantum computer, requiring millions of stable qubits, is still likely more than a decade away from reality.</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Supervised Robotaxi Launch in Austin Receives Mixed Reviews</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 08:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla recently held a small, supervised, and invite-only launch for its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, yielding a mix of positive and negative experiences. While some participants, including a Wedbush analyst, praised the vehicles' smooth and impressive maneuverability, other incidents were reported, such as a car driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping in traffic. The event highlights Tesla's unique camera-based approach to autonomous driving, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar. The limited deployment in a specific area also suggests Tesla may be adopting a more contained strategy, similar to its rivals.</p>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis has detailed an ambitious plan to revive the Stellantis-owned truck brand, which has seen its sales decline by 38% since 2019. The strategy includes bringing back the popular Hemi V-8 engine, reintroducing lower-priced models, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement to lead the turnaround, acknowledged that production issues and pricing strategies had hurt the brand. He is now aiming to reclaim significant market share in the highly profitable full-size pickup truck segment by the end of 2026.</p>
