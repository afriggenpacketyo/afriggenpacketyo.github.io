        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has passed a nonbinding resolution with a 142-10 vote, strongly endorsing a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution, based on the "New York Declaration," urges Israel to commit to a Palestinian state and outlines a phased plan to end the long-standing conflict. The United States and Israel voted against the measure, with the Israeli ambassador calling it a "hollow gesture" that benefits Hamas. The declaration also includes a rare condemnation of Hamas by Arab nations for the October 7 attacks while also condemning Israel's actions in Gaza, calling for a potential international stabilization mission.</p>

          <p>Following deadly anti-corruption protests, major political parties in Nepal are demanding that President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate the parliament he dissolved. The dissolution was recommended by the newly appointed interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki and was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement. However, a coalition of eight parties argues the move was unconstitutional and that protesters' demands should be addressed by an elected body. President Poudel has urged restraint and called for new elections to be held next year, emphasizing that the democratic system remains intact despite the political turmoil.</p>

          <p>Before appointing Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is understood to have directly questioned him about his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Insiders suggest Starmer posed three specific questions regarding Mandelson's continued contact with Epstein after his conviction. This revelation intensifies scrutiny over the Prime Minister's judgment, as Mandelson was subsequently dismissed from the post after new, damaging emails from 2008 came to light. Downing Street sources now believe Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his initial answers during the vetting process.</p>

          <p>US Representative Delia Ramirez and other Illinois officials are demanding a full investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The incident occurred during a traffic stop in a Chicago suburb, sparking outrage and raising concerns about the tactics used in the Trump administration's deportation campaign. While ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer with his car, community leaders argue that a traffic violation should never result in a death sentence. The killing has heightened tensions amid an intensified ICE operation in the Chicago area.</p>

The "Unite the Kingdom" rally featured speeches criticizing UK politicians and a video appearance by Elon Musk calling for a new election. The Metropolitan Police deployed over 1,000 officers to manage the tense situation, creating a sterile zone between the groups.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed at age 31, was a highly influential and polarizing figure in American conservative politics and a key ally of President Donald Trump. He co-founded Turning Point USA, a powerful youth organization aimed at promoting conservative principles on college campuses, which played a significant role in mobilizing young voters for the Republican party. Through his popular podcast and social media presence, Kirk was known for his staunch opposition to gun control and his controversial comments on race, gender, and politics. His death is being mourned by supporters as the loss of a major voice for the MAGA movement.</p>

The legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, is aimed at mitigating potential "catastrophic risks" from advanced AI, such as its use in developing biological weapons or causing major cyberattacks. Companies with revenues over $500 million would need to publish safety frameworks and report critical incidents. While proponents see it as a necessary, light-touch approach to regulation, some industry groups argue it could stifle innovation with excessive compliance costs.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, has stated that if elected, he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should he ever travel there. Mamdani alleges that Netanyahu is a war criminal and that he would honor an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant related to alleged war crimes in Gaza. Legal experts note that such an action would be a "practical impossibility" and could create a direct conflict with the U.S. federal government, which does not recognize the ICC's authority.

The judge ruled that the state attorney general's office lacked the authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute. This decision marks a major collapse of the state's controversial, two-year effort to use laws typically aimed at organized crime to prosecute a protest movement.

          <p>The growing popularity of lip oils has raised questions about their safety, with some users, particularly women of color, reporting hyperpigmentation after consistent use. Dr. Rebecca Small, a clinical professor at UCSF, explains that because lip skin is thin, it is vulnerable to sun damage and irritation. She advises that lip oils without SPF can magnify UV exposure, and ingredients like fragrances or some plumping agents can cause inflammation, leading to darkened skin. To use lip oils safely, consumers should focus on products with beneficial ingredients like hyaluronic acid and broad-spectrum SPF, while avoiding potential irritants.</p>

          <p>In response to a historic drought that severely restricted traffic, the Panama Canal Authority is moving forward with significant investments to ensure future water security. The plans include building the Rio Indo dam to supplement the canal's main water source and constructing a "land bridge" with a natural gas pipeline to transport energy products without relying on the canal's water levels. These projects are critical for the key global trade route, as the U.S. alone accounts for about 73% of the canal's traffic. While the projects aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change, they are not expected to be completed before the next anticipated El Niño event.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive 35-10 loss to New Mexico, criticism is mounting against UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster, with some calling for his dismissal. The Bruins have started the season 0-3 and have yet to lead at any point in a game, showing a lack of discipline with numerous penalties and a porous run defense. In the article, a columnist argues that Foster appears "completely out of his depth" and places ultimate responsibility on athletic director Martin Jarmond for the hire and the program's decline. The team's poor performance has raised the possibility of its first winless season in over a century.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared that the U.S. is prepared to impose "major sanctions" on Russia, but only on the condition that all NATO allies commit to doing the same and completely cease purchasing Russian oil. In a social media post described as a letter to NATO, Trump criticized the alliance for a lack of commitment and called the continued oil purchases by some members "shocking." He also suggested NATO should impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China for its role in buying Russian energy. This ultimatum places the onus on European allies to take drastic economic steps before his administration will escalate pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Utah Governor Spencer Cox described the event as a "loss of innocence" for a state that prides itself on being a sanctuary from national political strife. In an interview, Cox recounted a phone call from President Trump, who warned him about the dangers of their jobs. Cox expressed his deep dismay that the alleged killer was a local resident, reflecting on how the country's toxic political discourse has breached Utah's "stronghold." He remains hopeful that "The Utah Way" of consensus-building can offer a path forward, despite the state's increasingly hostile political environment.</p>

          <p>An animal shelter in Billings, Montana, has been forced to close indefinitely after smoke from methamphetamine being incinerated by the FBI filled the building, sickening its staff. Fourteen employees of the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter were hospitalized with symptoms like headaches and dizziness after the smoke was inadvertently drawn into the facility's ventilation system. The shelter's 75 animals were evacuated and relocated. The incident has sparked questions about why law enforcement uses the shelter's incinerator, typically for animal carcasses, to destroy seized narcotics within city limits.</p>

          <p>The article connects the recent ICE raids under the Trump administration to previous dark chapters in U.S. history, drawing parallels to policies like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the mass deportation of Mexican Americans during the Great Depression. It features the stories of individuals whose families were directly impacted by these past events, such as being unconstitutionally deported or born in internment camps. These survivors and their descendants describe the generational trauma caused by xenophobic policies and express their alarm at seeing similar tactics of family separation and community terror being repeated today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The source of Jeffrey Epstein's nearly $600 million fortune remains a subject of intense speculation, though it was largely built by serving a few billionaire clients. Epstein acted as a financial manager for Victoria's Secret founder Les Wexner and Apollo Global Management's Leon Black, earning hundreds of millions in fees for purported tax and estate planning advice. Despite not being a licensed accountant or tax attorney, he leveraged these relationships and a network of powerful figures to build immense wealth, much of which was shielded from taxes through companies in the U.S. Virgin Islands. His value to institutions like JPMorgan Chase also came from his role as an influential client developer.</p>

By introducing innovative limited-edition flavors and improving digital marketing, he has driven a surge in customer demand, with systemwide sales reaching $20.6 million in 2024.

          <p>The article explores the paradox facing the dictionary industry: while interest in language is at a high, the business of lexicography is collapsing. Digital accessibility and search engine algorithms that prioritize knowledge boxes over traditional dictionary sites have decimated traffic and ad revenue for companies like Merriam-Webster and Dictionary.com. The piece details the recent sale and subsequent gutting of Dictionary.com's expert staff, highlighting the economic unsustainability of employing professional lexicographers. With fewer than a quarter of the full-time lexicographers working today compared to 20 years ago, the future of these cultural institutions is in serious doubt.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, his allies and supporters have launched organized online campaigns to identify and punish individuals perceived as celebrating or disrespecting his death. At least 15 people, including journalists and teachers, have reportedly been fired or suspended from their jobs after making comments online. Far-right figures are publicly shaming Kirk's critics and demanding they be de-platformed, while some Republican officials have suggested more extreme measures. The article notes the contrast between this reaction and the mockery some of the same figures directed at past victims of political violence.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police has suspended eight officers and one staff member after a BBC investigation uncovered serious allegations of misconduct at Charing Cross police station. The claims, which will be featured in a Panorama documentary, include excessive use of force, discriminatory behavior, and misogynistic comments. The police watchdog is now investigating 11 current or former officers connected to the station. A senior Met official described the alleged behavior as "disgraceful" and announced immediate steps to dismantle the current custody team, marking another damaging scandal for the troubled London police force.</p>
