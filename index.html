          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, prompted acting Governor Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency. The Jones Road Wildfire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has burned over 8,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 3,000 residents. While evacuation orders have been lifted and major roads reopened, the fire is only 10% contained, and power outages have affected approximately 25,000 homes and businesses. Fire officials are working to establish containment lines and conduct backfiring operations to control the blaze, but the full extent of the damage is still being assessed. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's stock experienced a notable increase after activist investor Elliott Management disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the company. This move fueled speculation that Elliott would push BP to shift away from its green energy strategy and refocus on its core oil and gas businesses. BP subsequently announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments, marking a strategic shift from its earlier commitment to net-zero emissions. This decision followed a period of lagging performance compared to its competitors and reduced support for its CEO and outgoing Chair during board re-election votes.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that the Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of borrowers could negatively impact the U.S. economy. The resumption of collections, which had been paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to reduce consumer spending and potentially damage borrowers' credit scores. While the policy may provide some clarity for loan payments, the timing is considered unfortunate given the current economic uncertainty and the risk of a recession. The student-loan collection will be paid to the U.S. Treasury, adding to government revenue and potentially easing a fraction of the nation’s $36 trillion debt.</p>

A US trade deal could mitigate the impact of tariffs, but the UK faces economic challenges amid global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The European Union is positioning itself as a safe haven for academics facing funding cuts and political interference in the United States. Several European universities and the EU commission have announced programs to attract top talent, offering academic freedom, higher grants, and easier visa processes. The EU's efforts are particularly focused on researchers in fields such as immunology, climate change, and social sciences, which have been targeted by the Trump administration. This initiative aims to strengthen Europe's research capabilities while providing a refuge for displaced scholars. </p>

          <h2>The Energy Consumption of AI: Is It a Cause for Alarm?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 08:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving demand for data centers, which in turn are creating demand for more energy, raising concerns about its impact on climate change goals. While data centers currently account for a relatively small percentage of global electricity demand, their share is expected to grow with the expansion of AI and cryptocurrencies. However, advancements in computer efficiency, particularly in graphical processing units (GPUs), are helping to mitigate energy consumption. Additionally, AI tools can also contribute to environmental benefits by optimizing energy distribution and designing better batteries and solar cells. </p>
