          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained during a US immigration raid on a California cannabis farm. The United Farm Workers union stated the death resulted from the enforcement action, while the Department of Homeland Security reported the man fell from a greenhouse roof and was not being pursued. The incident occurred amid a broader crackdown on undocumented immigrants, which has led to protests and a federal judge temporarily blocking some of the administration's more aggressive tactics.</p>

          <p>The Welsh rugby team has ended an 18-match losing streak by defeating Japan in a closely contested match in Kobe. This victory, their first in 644 days, allowed them to level the series 1-1 and avoid setting a new tier-one record for consecutive losses. Despite a strong second-half comeback from Japan, late scoring from Wales secured the win under challenging heat and humidity conditions. The result provides a much-needed boost for the team ahead of a new permanent head coach being appointed.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is cautiously managing its relationship with the Trump administration as it aims for a presidential victory in 2027. While ideologically aligned on some issues, the party maintains distance due to French public skepticism towards Trump and the potential negative economic impact of US tariffs on its voter base. Analysts suggest the party is balancing the benefits of association with a rising global far-right against the risks of alienating moderate voters needed for an election win. This contrasts with other European far-right parties that have more openly embraced ties with the US.</p>

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, home of the LA Clippers, in an effort to elevate the sport's profile. Over 300 tons of sand were brought into the arena, creating a unique indoor beach environment for the competition. Players and fans alike noted the professional atmosphere, which differed greatly from traditional outdoor beach venues and presented new gameplay dynamics due to the lack of wind. The event is seen as an innovative step to grow beach volleyball's audience and explore new formats for the sport.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has sparked a nationwide debate. Proponents argue it could improve educational outcomes in diverse classrooms, but critics, including teachers' associations and student bodies, warn it is impractical and discriminatory. They argue the focus should be on language skills and providing targeted support to under-resourced schools rather than creating quotas based on ethnic origin. The discussion highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has shown mediocre performance in recent international studies.</p>

The author suggests that true hope lies not in legal frameworks but in Palestinian resilience and the eventual emergence of truth about their suffering.

          <p>Federal immigration authorities arrested approximately 200 people during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operation in Camarillo led to a tense standoff, with protesters clashing with federal agents, resulting in several injuries and four arrests for assault. One farm worker was critically injured after falling from a greenhouse roof during the raid. In response to the violence, President Trump authorized agents to arrest protesters, while Glass House Farms, one of the raided sites, stated it was cooperating with authorities and providing legal aid to detained workers.</p>

          <p>A fisherman in Hawaii made a remarkable catch, reeling in a 41-pound ahi tuna from the shore of Makua beach on Oahu. The catch, which took nearly 45 minutes to land, is unusual as ahi are typically found in deep, open waters. A video of the exciting moment has gained significant attention online. A marine biologist explained that the deep-water drop-off near the west side of the island makes such a catch possible, though still rare. The fisherman shared the impressive catch with friends and family after having a traditional gyotaku fish print made to commemorate it.</p>
