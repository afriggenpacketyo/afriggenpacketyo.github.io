          <p>Shohei Ohtani contributed an RBI single in the Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Nationals, marking his return to form after a brief RBI drought. The game saw Miguel Rojas shine with a two-run homer, while Ohtani displayed no lingering effects from a previous hit by a fastball. Manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension during the game due to a prior incident, and he confirmed that Ohtani is still scheduled to pitch against Washington. The article also covers other MLB action involving Japanese players, including Tomoyuki Sugano and Yusei Kikuchi, in their respective games.</p>

Police Chief Mark Bruley suggests calling 911 to confirm an officer's identity, while former Chief Brian Higgins recommends not opening the door to unverified individuals. Higgins also advises drivers to pull over in public places during traffic stops and to be wary of unprofessional behavior from officers.

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already been backed by MPs in the House of Commons, but faces opposition in the Lords due to concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords should scrutinize but not oppose the bill, while Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson plans to introduce amendments to strengthen safeguards.</p>

          <p>China's property sector is facing a prolonged downturn, worsened by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates a significant decrease in demand for new homes in urban areas, projecting a drop to under 5 million units per year. This decline is attributed to falling population and slowing urbanization, with a shrinking population expected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, Beijing's pronatalist policies are expected to have limited effect due to deep-rooted economic and social issues.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Religious Groups Warned About Foreign Infiltration</h2>

          <p>The head of China’s United Front Work Department has cautioned religious organizations to guard against “hidden dangers in the religious field and resolutely resist foreign infiltration.” Li Ganjie's warning follows similar calls by senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, to promote the “Sinicisation of religion.” This comes weeks before the Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday, amid ongoing efforts to control religious expression and loyalty within China. The directive underscores the government's concerns about external influences on religious practices and beliefs.</p>

The article explores the political motivations behind the attack, the potential for escalation, and the mixed reactions among Israelis, highlighting the risks and uncertainties of the ongoing conflict.

These actions are part of ongoing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, despite a ceasefire agreement reached in November. Both sides have accused each other of violations, and the Lebanese army is working to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure as part of the truce.</p>

The redeployment of the USS Nimitz from the South China Sea to support the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group in the Middle East has raised concerns in Taiwan. Analysts suggest the United States needs to balance immediate operational demands in the Middle East with long-term strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific amid fluctuating conflicts. The carrier canceled plans to dock in Vietnam due to an "emergent operational requirement."</p>
