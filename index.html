He shared the news on social media following the conclusion of his two-year world tour, explaining his desire for transparency about his health struggles. Timberlake noted that the joy of performing outweighed the physical challenges, and he hopes sharing his story will prevent misinterpretations of his condition. The 44-year-old artist did not disclose further details about his treatment but expressed gratitude for being able to complete the tour despite the debilitating symptoms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court critically examined the Trump administration's legal justification for imposing widespread tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). During arguments, judges questioned the unprecedented use of the law for tariffs, noting it doesn't explicitly grant that authority and could disrupt the existing trade framework established by Congress. The case, brought by several states and small businesses, challenges the president's claim of unbounded power to revise the nation's tariff schedule. The court's decision will likely be a major test of executive power and could be appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly, demanding they take steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. The directive calls for drugmakers to offer their medicines to Medicaid patients at the lowest price available in other developed nations, a policy known as "most favored nation." Trump threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies fail to comply. This move follows a previous executive order aimed at curbing high prescription costs and caused pharmaceutical stocks to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

Injuries reported by passengers included broken ribs and a broken leg among the crew.

          <p>Investors are anticipating Amazon's second-quarter earnings report, with a key focus on the impact of U.S. tariff policies and the company's investments in artificial intelligence. While Amazon previously warned that trade policies could affect results, some analysts believe the tariffs may have inadvertently benefited the company by weakening competition from Chinese e-commerce sites. Another major point of interest is the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly how the company's substantial AI spending is translating into revenue. The report's guidance will provide insight into whether Amazon expects these economic and technological trends to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

Industry experts warn that this could harm not only consumers but also U.S. businesses like restaurants, which rely on the high margins from imported alcohol sales. Trade groups are actively lobbying for exemptions, arguing that the tariffs will hurt both American and European businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers turning off their transponders and obscuring their names to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which reportedly generates billions for Iran, undermines U.S. efforts to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Despite new sanctions, the investigation observed a dozen such transfers in a single day, indicating the activity is increasing.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Hamas Strategically Benefits from Worsening Famine in Gaza</h2>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that Hamas has a strategic interest in promoting a famine in Gaza, viewing mass civilian suffering as its last hope for ending the war on its own terms. The author contends that the humanitarian crisis generates international pressure on Israel, which Hamas uses as leverage in negotiations. This perspective suggests Hamas's intransigence in cease-fire talks is a deliberate tactic to prolong the suffering. The article concludes by urging Israel to counter this strategy by flooding Gaza with aid, thereby alleviating the crisis and undermining Hamas's position.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its blockbuster drug Mounjaro showed significant heart health benefits in a head-to-head clinical trial with Trulicity, its older diabetes treatment. The study found Mounjaro was not only as effective as Trulicity in reducing risks like heart attack and stroke but also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. The company believes these comprehensive results strengthen the case for Mounjaro to be the first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The data could bolster Mounjaro's market position, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027.</p>

          <p>On the day of his company's successful stock market debut, Figma CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not view artificial intelligence as an imminent threat to his business. Speaking to CNBC, Field expressed skepticism that AI "superintelligence" will quickly be able to replicate the complex graphics engine and collaborative technology that underpins Figma's design software. He argued that the nuances of Figma's platform are not something AI can easily learn from public internet data. His comments provide insight into the company's strategic thinking as it navigates the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent imposition of heavy tariffs on Brazil and sanctions against a supreme court judge is being viewed by critics as an unprecedented interference in the nation's democracy. The moves are widely seen as an attempt to pressure Brazil into dropping a coup-related case against his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro. Observers describe the actions as a "classic 20th-century tinpot dictator" approach, using foreign and trade policy for personal political ends. While the pressure campaign has thrilled Bolsonaro's supporters, it has provoked a backlash within Brazil, where it is seen as an assault on national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A former nurse and an unnamed mother have lost their High Court challenge against the registration of Gender Plus, England's first private clinic to offer hormone treatment to teenagers with gender incongruence. The challengers had argued that the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), acted irrationally by approving the clinic without fully considering the cautious approach recommended by the recent Cass Review. However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rational, detailed, and had patient safety as its foremost concern. The ruling allows the "outstanding" rated clinic to continue its services.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has signaled a major shift in its Middle East policy, stating it could recognize a Palestinian state as early as September. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the change, linking it to conditions such as a ceasefire and a commitment from Israel to a long-term peace process. This move departs from Britain's historical position of waiting for a negotiated peace deal before granting recognition. The policy shift is seen as a response to both domestic pressure from pro-Palestinian supporters within the UK and a similar move by France to revitalize the two-state solution.</p>

He observes that in moments of crisis, patients often turn to spirituality, sometimes with anger and sometimes with strengthened faith. Park concludes that he finds God most present not in a church, but in the hospital, believing that "when love shows up, God shows up."</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise. The company also raised its adjusted profit outlook for the year, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and signs of recovery in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been struggling with high medical costs. CEO David Joyner attributed the success to investments in pharmacy technology and labor, as well as a new drug pricing model. The positive results in these areas helped offset a decline in the company's health services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager. (not investment advice)</p>
