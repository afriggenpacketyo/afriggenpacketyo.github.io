The IPO priced above the expected range, valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion before trading began. Despite reporting significant net losses in 2024 and the first half of this year, the company, which also offers a stablecoin and custody services, demonstrated strong market interest. The Winklevoss brothers, early Bitcoin investors, continue to advocate for smart regulation and predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million in a decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee, citing the city's "deeply troubled" state regarding crime. This move follows a similar federalization of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and is presented as an effort to dismantle violent crime fueled by "failed Democrat governance." Despite the Memphis Police Department reporting a 25-year low in overall crime and a six-year low in murder rates for the first eight months of 2025, Trump emphasized his intention to "fix" the city's issues. The administration faces ongoing legal challenges regarding the constitutional authority for such deployments in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte announced the launch of "Eastern Sentry," a new mission to protect the alliance's eastern flank after Russian drones violated Polish airspace. Rutte condemned the incursions as "dangerous and unacceptable," regardless of intent, noting similar past violations in other Baltic states and Romania. The operation will integrate air and ground assets from multiple allied nations, including Denmark, France, the UK, and Germany, reinforcing NATO's commitment to defend its territory.

          <p>Tyler James Robinson, 22, has been identified as the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, arrested after a family friend contacted authorities. Details emerging from the investigation reveal Robinson's academic background, his family's Republican affiliations, and his own shift towards political engagement. Investigators recovered unfired gun casings with anti-fascist and online culture inscriptions, including "Hey fascist! Catch!" and references to video games. Robinson's roommate also provided online messages indicating the suspect's preparations, including retrieving a rifle and changing outfits after the shooting, with the suspected Mauser rifle later recovered.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers passed a Trump-backed redistricting plan aimed at solidifying the Republican majority in Congress, redrawing the state's voting map to favor a Republican candidate in a currently Democrat-held seat. This mid-decade redistricting effort, which typically occurs after a national census, was prompted by President Trump's call for states to create more winnable Republican districts. Opponents, including Democrats and activists, argue the plan is illegal, dilutes the power of Black voters, and have vowed to challenge it in court or via a public referendum. The map now awaits Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe's signature.</p>

          <p>With multiple interest rate cuts already issued and more expected from the Federal Reserve, the article explores whether renewing a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) account is a wise decision this September. Despite rates not being as high as last year, current CD rates around 4.50% still offer significant earnings and crucial protection against rate volatility, unlike variable savings accounts. Renewing now may be a final opportunity to lock in a competitive high rate before further Fed cuts potentially reduce yields across the board. This strategy helps protect funds for an extended period, making it a potentially strong option for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale" offers a fine send-off for the acclaimed British costume drama, concluding the saga of the aristocratic Crawley family and their staff in 1930. The film skillfully grounds itself in smaller social and familial dramas, using the period setting to comment on contemporary issues like tabloid scandals and generational shifts in management. It features returning beloved characters and new guest stars, delivering mischievous humor and poignant observations. While some character development is limited, the film provides a pleasurable last visit, illustrating how much society has changed and how some human dynamics remain constant.</p>

          <p>The film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Long Walk" presents a grim dystopian vision where 100 teenage boys participate in a televised survival contest with a single winner. Directed by Francis Lawrence, the movie explores themes of extreme capitalism and the consumption of human destruction as entertainment. While showcasing strong performances from its young ensemble, the article notes the film's graphic content and its muddled message regarding desensitization to violence. It effectively captures the physical and emotional degradation endured by the participants, but struggles to fully implicate the audience in its critique of power abuses.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve preparing its first interest rate cuts in a year, potentially by 50 basis points, attention is turning to the record $7.6 trillion parked in money market funds. While some on Wall Street speculate this "wall of cash" could fuel a stock market rally, experts like Peter Crane argue that money fund assets typically only decline during periods of extreme economic calamity. Most of this cash is institutional, not retail, and unlikely to shift dramatically into riskier assets unless rates hit near zero. Investors are advised to consider moving to treasury ETFs or assessing equity portfolio holes, as money market yields become less attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro called for a non-partisan condemnation of political violence following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, criticizing President Trump for blaming the "radical left." Shapiro, who himself was targeted in an attempted arson, emphasized that violence against any politician makes everyone less safe and urged leaders to "speak and act with moral clarity" rather than vengeance. He praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox for his healing words amidst the tragedy. This article highlights the need for unity and a de-escalation of rhetoric in the face of increasing political polarization and violence.</p>

          <p>The family of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko is confident that a new inquest into his 1977 death will finally lead to the prosecution of those responsible. Biko, a Black Consciousness Movement founder, died from a brain injury in police detention, with former officers later admitting to assault, though no one was prosecuted under apartheid. His son, Nkosinathi Biko, emphasized the country's need to address its violent past for democracy to take root, stating the evidence clearly points to his murder by five implicated policemen. This new inquest comes 48 years after his death and five months after a judicial inquiry into apartheid-era crimes was announced.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing where musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister and Frank Zappa opposed mandatory warning labels on albums with explicit lyrics. Co-founded by Tipper Gore, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) argued for "truth in packaging" to aid parental guidance, presenting provocative lyrics and album art. Despite musicians' arguments against censorship, the PMRC succeeded, leading to the "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers. These voluntary labels, nicknamed "Tipper stickers," sometimes paradoxically boosted sales for artists, but also led stores like Wal-Mart to stop carrying labeled records, shaping music distribution and content for decades.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, began with a shaky start as the judge interrupted his opening statement. Routh, representing himself despite lacking legal education, veered into topics like human evolution and global conflicts, leading Judge Aileen Cannon to halt his remarks and warn against making a "mockery of the court." Prosecutors urged jurors to focus on evidence, which they claim includes Routh's methodical planning, military-grade weapon purchase, and a handwritten note expressing intent to kill Trump. A Secret Service agent testified to seeing Routh aim a rifle at him, leading to shots being fired.</p>

          <p>Following Charlie Kirk's assassination, influential right-wing figures, including President Trump, have framed his death as a martyrdom, fueling calls for vengeance and intensifying "spiritual warfare" rhetoric. Figures like Sean Feucht and Pastor Matt Tuggle declared his killing a "line in the sand" and an attack on Christian beliefs, with some vigils featuring chants of "White men, fight back!" Experts warn this religious glorification and rhetoric could amplify political conflicts and provoke extremism, drawing parallels to the January 6 Capitol attack.

          <p>A South African court rejected a bid to block a Netflix documentary about Thabo Bester, the convicted sexual assaulter and murderer who faked his death to escape prison. Bester and his partner argued the "Beauty and the Bester" documentary was defamatory and violated their fair trial rights, but the judge ruled they failed to prove urgency and that the matter was "firmly in the public domain." Bester, known as the "Facebook Sexual Assaulter" for luring victims online, was recaptured in Tanzania after his elaborate escape.

Peers are making emotional pleas, with some sharing personal experiences of suffering, while others raise concerns about potential pressure on vulnerable individuals and the normalization of suicide.
