          <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is discontinuing the LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Services program within the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline next month. This program, launched in September 2022, provided specialized support for LGBTQ+ individuals under 25, but SAMHSA says the 988 Lifeline will focus on serving all help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option. The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth, expressed concern over the program's closure, noting that it has provided life-saving services to over 1.3 million young people. Studies indicate that LGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of mental health challenges and suicidal thoughts compared to their cisgender and heterosexual peers.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated his willingness to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and speak with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz during a recent meeting with international news agencies. Putin reiterated that Germany is not a neutral party in the conflict due to its support for Ukraine, particularly the supply of tanks. He also asserted that Zelenskyy's legitimacy ended with his term last year, a claim rejected by Ukraine and its allies. Putin also offered to mediate between Israel and Iran, proposing a settlement that allows Iran to pursue a peaceful nuclear program while addressing Israeli security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans on Iran but has not yet made a final decision on whether to strike the country, according to sources. The decision is contingent on Tehran agreeing to abandon its nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful purposes only. Trump stated he prefers to make the final decision at the last moment due to the volatile nature of war. Israel has already begun striking Iran, and the U.S. has assisted in intercepting retaliatory missile strikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that official U.S. records significantly underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans. The research found that the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations is 6.5 years lower than the national average, a gap nearly three times greater than reported by the CDC. Racial misclassification, where AI/AN deaths are incorrectly recorded as "White," contributes to the skewed statistics, masking the true scale of premature mortality and health disparities. The lack of accurate data exacerbates health disparities by hindering targeted responses and funding for interventions and preventative measures.</p>

          <p>The State Department has issued new guidelines for more extensive social media vetting of international student visa applicants, instructing consular officers to look for signs of "hostility" toward the United States. Applicants will be asked to set their social media accounts to "public," and failure to do so may be seen as evasive. Officials will look for indications of hostility toward U.S. citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. The State Department says the new vetting guidelines are part of an effort to ensure proper screening of visitors and enhance the safety of the U.S. and its universities.</p>

This disagreement highlights a broader division within Trump's "America First" movement regarding intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict. Some, like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, believe Iran is close to a bomb, while others, like Tucker Carlson, argue that evidence is overstated to justify military action, drawing parallels to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>

          <h2>Republican Senators Support Trump on Israel-Iran Conflict Amidst MAGA Division</h2>

          <p>Senate Republicans have largely aligned behind President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict, trusting his judgment on potential U.S. involvement. Trump has stated he has not decided whether the U.S. should get more involved, dividing his MAGA base. Sen. Lindsey Graham endorsed the use of force if diplomatic efforts fail, while other Republicans emphasized that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Democrats, however, urge de-escalation and call for congressional approval before any military action is taken.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers argue in his appeal of E. Jean Carroll's defamation case. A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019, when he denied her accusation of sexual assault. The DOJ had argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, thus warranting DOJ representation. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold, after leaving Anfield, made his debut for Real Madrid in a game against Al-Hilal. The full-back had a shaky start, being caught out of position on multiple occasions.

By the time he came off, Alexander-Arnold had played more crosses, entered the final third of the pitch more, and had more passes in the final third of the pitch than any of his teammates.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon clashes with President Trump's recent claims that Iran is on the verge of obtaining one. This has led to a public dismissal of Gabbard's testimony by Trump, signaling a potential shift in administration policy. Gabbard's anti-interventionist stance and skepticism of intelligence agencies contrast with Trump's more hawkish tendencies and desire for displays of strength. This disagreement highlights the challenges of appointing individuals with conflicting views to key positions.</p>
