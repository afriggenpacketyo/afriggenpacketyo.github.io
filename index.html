            <h2>Trump Administration Exempts Tech Devices from Tariff Increases</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-12 10:44:49 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports, following concerns from U.S. tech companies about potential price increases. The exemptions cover electronic devices and components like semiconductors and memory cards. Apple, which manufactures a significant portion of its iPhones in China, stands to benefit from this decision, as do other smartphone giants like Samsung who have been diversifying their supply chains to mitigate reliance on China. This move is considered a win for tech investors, alleviating concerns about the impact of tariffs on the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With the rapidly approaching deadline of May 7, travelers flying out of United States airports will need to show TSA agents their REAL ID-compliant driver's license, or another form of compliant identification to pass through security.

Travelers can also use a valid passport as compliant identification.

            <p>Amid ongoing tariff uncertainty spurred by the Trump administration's trade policies, Americans are adjusting their spending habits in anticipation of rising prices. Some consumers are stockpiling essential goods and accelerating planned purchases of durable items like cars to avoid potential inflation. Others are cutting back on non-essential expenses, cancelling subscriptions, and increasing savings in cash due to market volatility. Small business owners are also feeling the impact, with some experiencing reduced demand for their services. The economic instability is prompting some to reconsider their unsustainable capitalistic practices.</p>

The report highlights that many critical defense items lack a strong industrial base in the United States, citing insufficient spending and consolidation within the defense industry. The Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defense spending for next year, but the report suggests that Washington may need to make substantial new investments and prudent reforms to sustain the supply of weapons to its partners.</p>

            <p>The annual Annapolis Cup croquet match between St. John's College and the U.S. Naval Academy took place. Thousands attended, many in costume, and the competition featured several games. The Navy won the tournament, and the event was celebrated with music, picnics, and tradition. A unique aspect of the Annapolis Cup is the uneven lawn, which adds unpredictability to the games.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States have commenced discussions in Oman regarding Tehran's nuclear program, marking the highest-level engagement between the two nations since 2018. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed Iran's desire for a "fair agreement," while emphasizing the importance of equality in negotiations. The talks are expected to address regional tensions, prisoner exchanges, and potential agreements to ease sanctions in exchange for controls on Iran's nuclear activities. The meeting was disclosed by President Trump during a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

            <p>Tennessee lawmakers, who advocate for the rights of unborn children, have supported a bill that would allow public schools to check the citizenship status of students. Undocumented children could be denied enrollment or forced to pay tuition. This bill is unconstitutional, but similar laws have remained on the books. Some argue that the bill is about fiscal responsibility, as Tennessee does not have enough money for education for undocumented children, however, this may be due to the state's regressive tax policies.</p>

            <p>Despite the recent market downturn caused by Donald Trump's tariffs, right-wing media outlets have largely defended the president or focused on other issues. Fox News commentators downplayed the market upheaval and supported Trump's policies, while Newsmax highlighted positive aspects of the tariffs. The Wall Street Journal criticized Trump's tariff policy, and Ben Shapiro scrutinized the tariffs but reaffirmed his support for the president. Some journalists noted that the coverage of financial data was more honest than their coverage of other controversial events.</p>

            <p>Credit card debt doesn't disappear when you die; it becomes the responsibility of your estate. Transfer-on-death designations avoid probate, but creditors can still pursue the transferred property. Depending on state law, creditors may have a longer time to make their claims. It's important to consult with an estate planning attorney to discuss your situation and possible alternatives. If you are unable to pay off your debt, you may want to discuss your situation with a bankruptcy attorney. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles are expected to significantly impact the automotive industry, leading to a drop in vehicle sales and higher prices. The tariffs could cost the industry over $100 billion and reduce annual sales by millions of vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. Automakers may bear some of the cost increases, but they're also expected to pass them along to consumers, potentially softening consumer demand. Automakers have responded with employee pricing deals and price freezes.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's economic policies, particularly his tariff war, are being compared to Liz Truss's economic policies in the UK, which resulted in higher bond yields and mortgage rates. Both situations saw equities and bonds fall in tandem, indicating capital flight from an entire national entity. Trump's actions may weaken America, just as Truss weakened Britain, by inflicting pain on U.S. investors and risking the end of dollar dominance. This has caused Europe to see the U.S. as an unreliable ally and a destructive force for economic stability.</p>

So is canola oil, vegetable oil, avocado oil, and pretty much everything else. (not investment advice)</p>
