        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Applied Materials, a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer, fell significantly after the company issued a weak financial forecast for the upcoming quarter. The guidance, which fell short of analyst expectations, was attributed to growing macroeconomic uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. This outlook overshadowed a third-quarter performance that actually exceeded earnings and revenue estimates, highlighting investor concern over future headwinds. Bank of America subsequently downgraded the stock, citing the persistent challenges and lower visibility in the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictably profitable than in previous years due to shifting consumer behaviors and economic uncertainty. Travelers are increasingly booking flights for earlier in the summer, such as May and June, and demand for European travel is moving into the fall. In response, carriers have reduced their August schedules to align capacity with fluctuating demand and rising labor costs. This strategic adjustment aims to stabilize fares after a period of price cuts intended to attract more customers, reflecting a more complex and less predictable travel market. </p>

          <p>Following an incident where he was hit in the face by a small ball during a performance, country music star Luke Bryan has strongly condemned the trend of throwing objects at artists on stage. He referred to those who engage in this behavior as "idiots" and a sign of the "deterioration of the moral fabric." Bryan explained that while the object that hit him was minor, such actions cause unnecessary concern for his family and friends. He noted that this is not a new phenomenon, recalling that fans have previously thrown expensive cell phones on stage. </p>

          <p>In a display of military readiness, the United States has deployed two B-2 stealth bombers to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. The move comes just ahead of a high-stakes summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled to take place at the same base. These long-range bombers, capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, are considered a significant symbol of American power. The deployment underscores the serious geopolitical context of the meeting, which is focused on seeking a ceasefire in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and marks Putin's first visit to the U.S. in a decade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is reviewed as a worthy modern Western that explores themes of freedom and resilience through the story of a struggling ranch matriarch and her daughter in South Dakota. Directed by Kate Beecroft, the movie employs a docu-fiction approach, casting first-time actors to play versions of themselves, which lends an authentic, lived-in quality to the narrative. While the article suggests the film's dramatic structure is sometimes less transcendent than other works in the genre, it praises the compelling performances of its leads, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga. The review highlights the film's success in capturing the grit and warmth of women forging their own path in a harsh environment.</p>

While D.C. did experience a crime spike in 2023, the article notes that violent crime has seen a significant decrease in 2024 and 2025, aligning with a broader national trend. The fact-check clarifies that comparing D.C.'s crime rates to states is inappropriate, and when compared to other major cities, it is not the most violent. The article points out that even the AI bot on Trump's Truth Social platform offers a more nuanced view of the city's crime situation.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is expected to strengthen further, potentially becoming a major hurricane early next week. Currently a Category 1 storm, Erin is moving west-northwest over the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are urging Caribbean islands, particularly the northern Leeward Islands, to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. While the hurricane is not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, its path is being closely watched as it curves northward.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such a move as essential for U.S. national security. The argument is that direct government intervention is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential investment, possibly funded through the CHIPS Act, aims to bolster domestic high-end technology production. This development comes as Intel's CEO met with President Trump to discuss the company's future and allegations regarding his ties to China.</p>

Conversely, Ukraine seeks a complete withdrawal of Russian forces and a just end to the conflict, with President Zelenskyy expressing reluctance to cede any territory.

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the federal government following President Trump's move to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).

D.C. officials contend there is no emergency to justify the action and that it creates a dangerous confusion in the police command structure. This legal challenge represents a direct confrontation between the local D.C. government and the Trump administration over the principle of home rule.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the action. Citing the Home Rule Act of 1973, the resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to legally take control of the Metropolitan Police Department. Sponsors of the measure, including Representative Jamie Raskin, accuse the president of using a misleading narrative about the city's crime rate to justify the move. They assert that the federal takeover is an egregious attack on D.C.'s autonomy and has worsened public safety.</p>

In Pakistan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been hit hardest, and rescue efforts were complicated by the crash of a relief helicopter that killed five crew members. In India-administered Kashmir, a remote village crowded with pilgrims was severely affected, with dozens killed and many more missing.

          <p>The Salford Red Devils' upcoming Super League rugby match against Wakefield has been cancelled over significant player welfare concerns. The financially troubled club made the decision after a recent 80-6 defeat where they had to field five debutants due to an exodus of senior players. With only 17 players available for the next game, most lacking top-flight experience, the club and the Rugby Football League agreed to call off the fixture. The league's board will now determine the official outcome of the cancelled match, while discussions continue about Salford's ability to fulfill its remaining games this season.</p>

UnitedHealth's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid public backlash over rising healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation.

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, has occurred in a Northern California geothermal field known as The Geysers. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area due to the operations of one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity induces these minor quakes by causing the surrounding rock to contract and interact with different temperatures. Officials emphasize that these events are localized and not related to major fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is petitioning the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's order that placed restrictions on federal immigration raids in Los Angeles. The contested order from a federal judge prohibits law enforcement from stopping or detaining individuals based solely on factors like their race, their use of the Spanish language, or their presence at day-laborer sites. While the injunction is narrow, allowing agents to consider these factors in combination with others, it has reportedly led to a significant reduction in immigration arrests. The case raises fundamental questions about the extent to which courts can impose broad restrictions on law enforcement tactics.</p>

The Trump administration's reduction in force, announced in April, would cut the agency's staff from over 1,600 to approximately 200 employees. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the legal challenge from the employees' union must go through the civil service review process rather than the district court.

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee has indicated a degree of caution regarding future interest rate cuts, citing a "note of unease" from recent inflation data. While the July consumer price index was largely in line with expectations, a surprisingly high producer price index, particularly in services, has created uncertainty. Goolsbee stated that he would like to see at least one more inflation report before the Fed's September meeting to determine if the economy is still on a "golden path" of moderating inflation and a stable labor market. The potential impact of tariffs on prices also remains a lingering concern for policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>
