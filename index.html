          <p>Twenty years after Natalee Holloway's disappearance in Aruba, a private investigator hired by the Holloway family says unanswered questions remain despite Joran van der Sloot's confession. Van der Sloot confessed in 2023 to killing Holloway after she refused his advances, but the investigator believes he did not act alone. The investigator continues to seek information, believing others were involved in Holloway's disappearance, despite Van der Sloot's confession and subsequent conviction. Van der Sloot is currently serving prison time in Peru for another murder and will be extradited to the U.S. to serve a sentence for Holloway's murder. </p>

          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that attacked around 50 people in a Hertfordshire village has found a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk, which caused injuries requiring hospital treatment, was captured after disrupting postal deliveries and terrorizing residents for over a month. Falconer Wayne Housden has trained the bird and built an aviary for it, planning to eventually let it fly free. Housden believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner and aims to provide it with a stable environment.</p>

The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole and similar measures in the EU and UK have added to the company's difficulties.</p>

          <p>Glaciers are melting at twice the rate measured two decades ago, affecting water supply, ecosystems, and infrastructure worldwide. The collapse of a glacier in the Swiss Alps caused a landslide, highlighting the dangers of melting ice.

Communities are adapting by changing crops and implementing early warning systems, but scientists emphasize the need to slow rising temperatures to address the root cause.</p>

The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals. The UK has lost a significant portion of its saltmarshes to agriculture, but they are crucial in the fight against climate change. WWF's research shows that saltmarshes capture carbon in the soil, making them as important as trees for climate mitigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump attacked conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." Trump's criticism came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled most of his tariffs illegal. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming it gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. Leo responded that he was grateful for Trump transforming the Federal Courts and considered it a privilege to be involved.</p>
