          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to explore allowing alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity in employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement accounts. The move, long sought by the private equity and crypto industries, would require the Labor Department to review and potentially rewrite regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While investment firms support the change for offering broader choices, it may take several years before these new investment options become widely available in Americans' retirement plans.

The bird was recorded repeating the phrase "two for 25," a suspected reference to a drug deal, on a phone belonging to one of the gang members.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that restricts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in Southern California. A federal judge had ruled these tactics, which involved stopping individuals based on factors like race or language, likely violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a region with a large undocumented population.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's homelessness minister following allegations of hypocrisy related to a property she owns. Ali was accused of ending a tenancy to sell the house, only to re-list it for rent at a higher price shortly after, an action that would be restricted under the Renters' Rights Bill she was helping to advance. In her resignation letter, Ali maintained she followed all legal requirements but stated that remaining in her role would be a distraction for the government.</p>

          <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is facing backlash from the scientific community after stating the Trump administration plans to review and "update" past National Climate Assessment (NCA) reports. Critics fear this is an attempt to alter or suppress established scientific findings on climate change to align with the administration's pro-fossil fuel agenda. The move, which one scientist compared to Stalinist revisionism, follows the recent deletion of the website hosting the legally mandated reports and is seen as an attack on scientific integrity.</p>

          <p>The attempt by Texas Republicans to redraw congressional maps mid-decade has triggered a dangerous political game that could spread nationwide, with Democrats in other states threatening retaliation. This article analyzes the trend as a form of "total politics," where officials use any available legal tool for partisan advantage, regardless of the long-term damage to representative governance. The conflict highlights the weakness of legal protections against partisan gerrymandering and the potential erosion of the Voting Rights Act, threatening to strip meaning from the act of voting itself.</p>
