          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 07:56:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a £122.7 million fine by Ofwat for multiple breaches, including sewage spills and improper shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by the water industry regulator. The fine includes £104.5 million for sewage operation violations and £18.2 million for dividends paid out in 2023 and 2024 that did not reflect the company's performance. Ofwat's investigation revealed that Thames Water failed to maintain adequate infrastructure, leading to routine storm overflow spills rather than exceptional circumstances. The company, burdened by a £20 billion debt, is in discussions for new investments but faces scrutiny over past dividend payouts instead of infrastructure improvements. Optimism is low as the company faces significant challenges in addressing its environmental and financial issues.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized the Republican spending bill, arguing that it undermines the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to reduce wasteful government spending. Musk stated that the bill, projected to increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, contradicts DOGE's work, which claims to have saved $170 billion in taxpayer money since January. DOGE has implemented controversial measures, including agency cuts and government layoffs, to achieve these savings. Trump and congressional Republicans defend the bill, asserting it reduces spending in key areas and will stimulate economic growth. Musk has stepped back from his DOGE role to focus on his companies, citing challenges within the federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>The Vietnamese government is reportedly fast-tracking approvals for a $1.5 billion luxury golf resort owned by the Trump Organization, raising concerns about preferential treatment amid trade tensions with the U.S. The project, which broke ground within three months of initial filings, has allegedly bypassed domestic regulations and counters local housing plans. This development coincides with Vietnam facing potential tariffs from the Trump administration, leading to speculation that Hanoi is attempting to curry favor through business deals with the Trump family. While the White House maintains a separation between trade discussions and the Trump family's business dealings, the timing and government facilitation of the project have drawn scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the Czech Republic have condemned a cyber campaign targeting the Czech Foreign Ministry, attributing it to APT31, a group associated with China's Ministry of State Security. The attack, which began in 2022, affected critical infrastructure and led to the summoning of the Chinese ambassador in Czechia. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky stated that China is interfering in Czech society through cyberattacks, manipulation, and propaganda. The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called the cyber campaign a clear and unacceptable violation of international norms, reflecting heightened tensions over cybersecurity between China and the West.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Elon Musk's position leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to characterize it as temporary. This ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by 14 states alleging that Musk's sweeping cuts and changes to the federal government are unconstitutional because he lacks Senate confirmation. While the judge dismissed President Trump as a defendant, she allowed the case to proceed, citing credible arguments that Musk holds significant authority without proper appointment. The states also allege that DOGE gained unauthorized access to private and proprietary information.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and varying consumer adoption rates of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume in 2024 to roughly 20% by 2030, with the potential for adjustments based on regulations and customer acceptance. Toyota's strategy reflects a cautious approach to electrification, balancing investments in all-electric vehicles with the practical appeal of PHEVs.

The sport has been dominated by Mongolian wrestlers in recent years, making Onosato's achievement a significant moment for Japanese sumo. Onosato, whose real name is Daiki Nakamura, expressed his determination to uphold the title of yokozuna and bring encouragement to Ishikawa prefecture, which was affected by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2024.

          <p>The Labour government in England is reviewing environmental regulations, specifically Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements, to make it easier for small housebuilders to construct homes on smaller sites. These regulations require developers to compensate for any loss of nature on housing developments, and ministers are considering reducing these costs for smaller builders. The proposals are part of a broader package of housing reforms aimed at simplifying the planning system and speeding up house-building. The government hopes these changes will help reach its target of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2030, though critics argue that the changes could compromise environmental protections.</p>

          <p>The UN Human Rights Office reports that 47 people were injured in Gaza when crowds overwhelmed an aid distribution center run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with most injuries attributed to gunshots believed to be from the IDF. The Hamas-run health ministry reported one death and 48 injuries. The IDF stated that troops fired "warning shots" into the air, but not at people, while the GHF denied any shots were fired at the site. The GHF's aid distribution system bypasses the UN, which has criticized it as unethical, as the UN agencies warn of catastrophic hunger levels in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, calling it unconstitutional and "absurd." Judge Richard Leon criticized the order, which targeted the firm for hiring Robert Mueller, who oversaw the probe of possible coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Leon emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating that the order would be unfaithful to the Founding Fathers. The judge's ruling reflects the ongoing legal battles surrounding Trump's actions and their impact on the legal system.</p>

Trump informed their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, of the decision in a phone call.

The couple, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were convicted of providing false information to banks and fabricating bank statements. The pardon follows Savannah Chrisley's appeal to the Trump administration and her speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention.</p>

All student visa applications will now have their social media scrutinized for proof of support for "terrorist activity or a terrorist organization."

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to lift judge-ordered due process procedures for immigrants slated for deportation to third countries. The administration argues that a nationwide mandate issued by a Massachusetts judge has created a "diplomatic and logistical morass" that is imposing "significant and irreparable harm" on the government's efforts to remove criminal aliens. The judge's order requires detainees to be given notice of their destination, time to raise safety concerns, and time to contest adverse findings. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law."</p>

This dependence has national security implications, including a shortage of civilian sailors and support ships.

          <p>The article argues that the socialist left's commitment to materialism, the idea that material or economic interests are the primary drivers of human behavior, leads to a misunderstanding of the far right's rise.

However, the author contends that the far right's appeal is rooted in postmaterial values such as cultural identity and traditional hierarchies.
