          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing his decision to keep interest rates steady.  Legal challenges exist regarding Trump's authority to dismiss Powell before his term ends.  Trump's criticism stems from Powell's interest rate policies, which Trump believes are not sufficiently stimulating economic growth.  The Fed's decisions involve balancing economic growth and inflation control, a strategy Trump disagrees with (not investment advice).</p>

While Trump's pressure has been successful in increasing defense spending, some European nations struggle to meet the targets. The summit's focus underscores the significant influence of the US within the alliance.</p>
