          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi endured a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where she was questioned over the alleged "weaponization" of the Justice Department under the Trump administration. Democrats focused on controversial actions, including the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and the department's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The hearing exposed deep partisan divisions regarding the DOJ's independence, with Republicans citing politicization under the previous administration while Democrats accused Bondi of protecting the president's allies and targeting political opponents.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has proposed the creation of an "open and shared sustainable mega constellation" (OSSMC) of satellites powered by artificial intelligence. The project aims to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded low Earth orbit and promote more equitable global access to space resources. With over a million satellites already filed for launch worldwide, led by projects like SpaceX's Starlink, this initiative presents a Chinese solution for collaborative space system management. The goal is to build a shared infrastructure that benefits all of humanity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the declining fertility rate among Black Americans, suggesting that growing fears about racism may be a significant contributing factor. Historically, Black women have had higher fertility rates than white women, but this gap has rapidly closed. The author argues that constant exposure to racial animus through news and social media, coupled with political rhetoric and policies seen as hostile, may be consciously or unconsciously discouraging Black individuals from having children. This trend has profound social and political implications, potentially weakening political capital and straining familial support systems for the elderly.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 09:59:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold reached a historic high of $4,000 per ounce, driven by investor demand for a safe-haven asset amid geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, and persistent inflation. Central banks and retail investors are increasing their gold purchases to hedge against risks like U.S. sanctions and to protect against inflation's erosive effects. The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made non-yielding assets like gold more attractive compared to debt instruments, further fueling its price surge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A government shutdown has commenced after Congress failed to pass a funding deal, forcing active-duty military personnel to continue their duties without receiving timely pay. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees once the shutdown ends, military pay is not guaranteed unless separate legislation is passed. The Department of Defense has issued contingency guidance prioritizing critical missions, and financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering no-interest loans to affected service members to mitigate financial hardship.</p>

          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is guaranteed by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal workers and congressional staff will see their paychecks delayed until a funding agreement is reached. The different treatment highlights the unique status of elected officials during a lapse in federal funding.</p>

          <p>Despite the government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks on schedule, as the program is covered by mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning many other services could be disrupted. The agency's contingency plan indicates that while benefit payments will proceed, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards will be halted.

          <p>The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments concerning Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors, a practice aimed at changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The case was brought by a Christian counselor who argues the ban violates her free speech rights by censoring conversations with young patients about their gender and sexuality. Colorado officials defend the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from harmful and ineffective practices. The case could have significant implications for state authority to regulate healthcare and the scope of First Amendment protections for professionals.</p>

          <p>Two years after Hamas's surprise attack on October 7, 2023, the conflict has evolved into a systematic and brutal war with devastating consequences for Gaza. Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to unprecedented destruction and a civilian death toll exceeding 67,000, according to Hamas-run health officials. The conflict has broadened, with Israeli military operations extending into Lebanon, Syria, and Iran, backed by U.S. support. Amid accusations of genocide, which Israel denies, a new 20-point peace plan proposed by President Trump is being negotiated, offering a potential but complex path toward a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Financial planners suggest that choosing between pretax and Roth 401(k) contributions should involve considering your future effective tax rate, not just your current marginal rate. Your marginal rate is the tax on your last dollar earned, while your effective rate is the total tax paid as a percentage of your gross income, which is often much lower. Because of standard deductions and progressive tax brackets, your effective tax rate in retirement could be significantly less than your marginal rate during your working years, potentially making traditional pretax contributions more advantageous.

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor in affordability. As of early October, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is around 6.34%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.64%; refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could stabilize or even lower these rates in the near future. To secure the best possible rate, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, maintain a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and compare offers from multiple lenders.

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has expressed a willingness to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare insurance costs, a key sticking point in the ongoing government shutdown. In a social media post, she stated her disgust that tax credits from the Affordable Care Act are set to expire, which would double insurance premiums for many, including her own children. While maintaining her opposition to the ACA itself and to providing healthcare for undocumented immigrants, Greene criticized her own party for not prioritizing the issue and signaled she is prepared to break from the party line to find a solution for American families.</p>

          <p>In a party conference speech, UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick criticized what he termed "activist" judges, particularly in immigration cases, and outlined plans to give ministers more control over judicial appointments. He pledged that a future Conservative government would abolish the Judicial Appointments Commission, a body created to enhance transparency, thereby restoring direct ministerial power over the selection of judges. Jenrick argued this would prevent judges who blur the line between adjudication and activism from being appointed, ensuring judicial power remains accountable to Parliament.</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the total number of homes bought by investors decreased year-over-year, their market share grew because overall home sales were much weaker. Small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, accounting for over 90% of investor-owned homes. In contrast, large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters, shifting capital towards build-to-rent communities rather than existing homes.

However, a 2008 analysis revealed that even during this period, scientific papers predicting warming outnumbered those predicting cooling by six to one. The author of the original Newsweek story later recanted the idea, acknowledging that the early hypotheses were seriously incomplete.</p>
