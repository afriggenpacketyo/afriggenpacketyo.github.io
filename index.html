          <p>R&B singer R. Kelly was reportedly hospitalized due to an alleged overdose caused by prison officials, according to his lawyers. The attorneys claim mismanagement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and that Kelly was denied surgery. However, sources indicate Kelly was taken for routine medical care and has since returned to the North Carolina prison where he is serving a 30-year sentence for racketeering and sex trafficking. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, citing privacy and security reasons, as well as pending litigation. The tone is somewhat ambiguous due to the conflicting reports regarding the reason for his hospitalization.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has stated that the small boats situation in the English Channel is 'deteriorating' ahead of a UK-France summit on border security. More than 1,500 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats last week, bringing the year's total to over 16,000. This is 42% higher than at the same point last year. The leaders agreed that their teams should pursue high-ambition outcomes that deliver for the British and French people. The tone is concerned and urgent, focusing on the escalating issue of illegal immigration.</p>
