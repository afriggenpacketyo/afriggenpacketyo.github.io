          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has lodged a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges misrepresentations on mortgage and ethics documents related to a condominium in Massachusetts. The move comes as President Trump seeks to remove Cook from the Fed's board, an action she is challenging in court. Pulte's actions are seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to exert influence over the central bank's policies.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. trade policy exempting packages valued under $800 from import duties has been eliminated by the Trump administration, affecting millions of daily shipments. This change forces postal carriers and shippers to collect tariffs on previously duty-free goods, with experts warning of significant cost increases and logistical challenges for small and medium-sized businesses. Several international postal services, including those in the U.K., Japan, and Germany, have suspended shipments to the U.S. to adapt to the new rules. The administration argues the move closes a loophole used for illicit goods and benefits American manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra for violating ethics standards over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. In the call, she criticized the Thai army and referred to Hun Sen informally, which the court ruled undermined national interests during a period of border tension. This decision marks a significant blow to the influential Shinawatra political dynasty, as she is the third family member to be removed from the premiership. Parliament will now select a new leader, creating further political instability in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced it will not invite an official Israeli government delegation to the DSEI defence exhibition in London, citing Israel's decision to escalate its military operations in Gaza. The move was described as a "deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination" by Israel's defence ministry, which will withdraw its national pavilion. While individual Israeli defence firms can still attend, the decision reflects growing criticism from U.K. leaders over the conduct of the war and the humanitarian crisis. This follows other diplomatic pressures, including the suspension of trade talks and sanctions on West Bank settlers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city is protected by a sophisticated $14.4 billion levee system, but its long-term effectiveness is uncertain. The region faces significant challenges from rising sea levels and land subsidence, with parts of the system sinking faster than originally projected. These environmental pressures, combined with potential federal and state funding cuts under the Trump administration, raise concerns about the city's future resilience against increasingly powerful storms. Experts warn that while the new system is a major improvement, it may not be sufficient to protect against future climate-fueled hurricanes without sustained investment and maintenance.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has stated there is "no way" the U.S. can invade his country, following the deployment of American warships and troops to the Caribbean for what Washington calls an anti-drug operation. In response, Venezuela has mobilized its own warships and initiated a militia recruitment drive to bolster its defenses. The U.S. has not made any public threat of invasion, but the military presence is part of its "maximum pressure" policy against Maduro's government. Tensions remain high, with the Trump administration accusing Maduro of leading a drug trafficking cartel and offering a large bounty for his capture.</p>

Despite this pressure, the banks also showed slight improvements in their non-performing loan ratios, reflecting strong government support in managing bad debt.

          <p>Consistently waking up much earlier than desired and being unable to fall back asleep is a form of insomnia known as early morning awakening. This condition becomes more common with age due to natural shifts in circadian rhythms, declining melatonin production, and hormonal changes associated with menopause. Other significant factors include mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, as well as evening alcohol consumption, which disrupts sleep in the later part of the night. Sleep specialists recommend addressing the root cause, improving sleep hygiene with consistent schedules, and consulting a doctor or therapist if the problem persists.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Home Office has instructed its contractor, Mitie, to withdraw a job advertisement for a tutor to teach "balloon-craft" and cake decorating at the Heathrow immigration removal center. The role, which drew criticism from Conservative politicians, was intended to provide creative workshops for migrants awaiting deportation. A Home Office minister stated the role was not considered necessary, and the department is now reviewing all activities offered across its detention facilities. Rights charity Detention Action argued that such activities are part of the government's duty to support the mental wellbeing of people held in long-term detention.</p>

          <p>Germany's unemployment total has risen above three million people, a symbolic threshold not crossed in over a decade, according to the Federal Employment Agency. The increase reflects the country's prolonged period of economic weakness and a slowdown in labor demand, with 68,000 fewer job openings compared to the previous year. While officials noted that the summer holiday season contributed to the rise and expect an autumn recovery, the figures underscore the significant economic challenges facing the nation. Employer associations have criticized the government for inaction, calling the number "a disgrace" and urging immediate economic reforms. (not investment advice)</p>

While Townsend stated she did not interpret the remarks as racial, Osaka highlighted the historical stigma behind such language.

          <p>Federal prosecutors claim that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is inspiring others to commit acts of violence. In a court filing related to their pursuit of the death penalty, prosecutors argued that Mangione sought to "normalize the use of violence to achieve ideological or political objectives." They cited the recent deadly shooting at the NFL headquarters as evidence of his growing influence, noting that both attackers left behind notes expressing grievances against large organizations. The filing asserts that Mangione poses a continuing danger by cultivating supporters through a website from jail.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has slashed its annual economic growth forecast for 2025 by more than half, from 3% down to 1.4%, largely due to weaker performance expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The company, which produces the popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has been a primary driver of Denmark's recent economic boom. However, increased competition, inventory issues, and the impact of U.S. tariffs have led to a significant downward revision in its contribution to the nation's exports. This highlights the Danish economy's heavy reliance on the success of a single company and sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department is raising concerns about the potential for a centralized, politically loyal national police force. Coupled with a new executive order to create deployable federal public safety units and a shift in the FBI's mission towards violent crime, critics fear these actions could erode the tradition of local policing. Analysts suggest these moves are creating a framework that could be used to suppress dissent or challenge election outcomes in a future crisis. The focus on hiring politically loyal individuals for these new roles is seen as a particularly ominous development for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Relatives of two of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022 are asking a judge to block the public release of graphic crime scene photos and videos. Following the sentencing of killer Bryan Kohberger, the city of Moscow released some images with bodies blurred, but the families argue the images of blood and sounds of distress are still intensely traumatizing. Their lawyer contends that blurring is insufficient and that releasing such material victimizes the families again, especially given the "true crime industry" that could exploit the content. The city maintains it is legally required to release the records but attempted to balance privacy with public interest.</p>

These items, which include chemical materials, medical supplies, and electronic components, will continue to be exempt from the Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25%. The tariffs were originally imposed during President Trump's first term to address what the U.S. deemed unfair trade practices by China.

          <p>"Bugonia," the latest collaboration between actress Emma Stone and director Yorgos Lanthimos, has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, earning praise for its unique story and performances. Stone plays a powerful CEO who is kidnapped by two men (played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis) who are convinced she is an alien. The film is described as a gripping kidnap drama that also functions as a dark comedy exploring themes of conspiracy theories and societal paranoia. Critics have highlighted Stone's central performance and Lanthimos's direction in what is being called a "genre-hopping blast of suspense, sci-fi, and dark comedy."</p>

          <p>The White House has named Jim O’Neill, a deputy to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This appointment follows the firing of the previous director, Susan Monarez, who is reportedly contesting her removal. O'Neill, who lacks a medical or scientific background and has a history in investment and politics, is seen as an ally in Kennedy's efforts to overhaul U.S. vaccine policy. The leadership change has caused turmoil at the agency, with four other senior officials resigning in protest of what they call political interference and budget cuts.</p>
