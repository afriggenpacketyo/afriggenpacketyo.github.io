        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Korean state media announced the completion of the final ground test for a new solid-fuel engine intended for intercontinental ballistic missiles, with leader Kim Jong Un personally supervising. This development is significant as solid-fuel technology allows for missiles to be prepared in advance, making them quicker to launch and more difficult for adversaries to detect. Analysts suggest this signals that a full-scale missile test is imminent, possibly before the end of the year, amid deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.</p>

          <p>France is facing deepening political turmoil after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's minority government was defeated in a confidence vote, triggered by a failure to secure support for the 2026 budget. The proposed budget aimed to implement €44 billion in cuts to reduce the nation's significant deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, with options including another centrist leader, a technocratic government, or calling a snap election, all of which present significant political challenges and risk further deadlock.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has voiced significant concern that the United Kingdom might require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She argued that without a clear government plan for economic growth, rising taxes and unstable public finances could lead to this outcome, pointing to rising UK borrowing costs as a worrying indicator. In response, a Labour Party source criticized the warning, attributing the country's current economic state to the previous Conservative government's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued an immediate evacuation order for residents of Gaza City, warning of an impending large-scale operation if Hamas does not release its remaining hostages. The directive has created panic among the city's one million inhabitants, many of whom have been displaced multiple times and have no safe place to go. This escalation follows nearly a year of conflict that has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with international organizations fearing the true death toll is much higher.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, analysts predict that his successor will likely continue to view China as a strategic competitor, maintaining pressure on the complex relationship between the two nations. Ishiba announced his resignation after securing a trade deal with the United States that reduced tariffs on Japanese auto imports, stating his work on the issue was complete. While China's foreign ministry has refrained from commenting on Japan's internal politics, the leadership change in Tokyo is being closely watched for its potential impact on regional dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that populist right-wing movements in the U.S. and UK, led by figures like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, are actively attempting to rewrite national history to justify eroding democratic rights. The piece points to the Trump administration's efforts to remove 'divisive' exhibits from museums and Reform UK's call for a more 'patriotic' curriculum as examples of this strategy. This historical reframing, the author contends, is not merely a culture war tactic but a foundational step toward dismantling 20th-century progress in civil rights, worker protections, and social welfare.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to reveal its next iPhone lineup, with speculation mounting that prices may increase for the first time in five years due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The new models are expected to be manufactured in China and India, despite pressure from Washington to move production to the U.S. While CEO Tim Cook has made diplomatic efforts to shield Apple from the most severe duties, the devices still face a 25% tariff, which could lead to a $50 to $100 price increase on some models.

          <p>England's national football team, led by coach Thomas Tuchel, is preparing for a crucial World Cup qualifying match against Serbia in Belgrade's notoriously intense Rajko Mitic Stadium.

The match in the hostile Serbian capital is seen as the first true test of temperament and progress under Tuchel's leadership.

          <p>Chinese state-owned telecom giant China Unicom has been granted a license to operate satellite mobile communication services, a significant step toward the commercial rollout of a domestic competitor to systems like Starlink. The license allows the company to offer direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, which is crucial for emergency communications and expanding internet access to remote areas. This move follows a new government guideline encouraging the use of low-orbit satellites to broaden high-speed data services and comes shortly after China Unicom successfully launched four of its own low-orbit satellites.</p>

          <p>As the UK government moves to close hotels used for housing asylum seekers, tensions are rising in local communities over the potential increased use of shared houses, or HMOs. In towns like Warrington, residents have protested outside asylum hotels citing safety concerns, while in nearby Wigan, an area with many HMOs, locals report issues of intimidation and a lack of consultation. The shift in policy is creating a complex dilemma, pitting community anxieties against the government's need to find alternative, cost-effective accommodation, with critics warning it could exacerbate existing social pressures.</p>

Despite years of failed negotiations to reach a water-sharing agreement, Ethiopia maintains the dam will benefit the entire region and has largely self-funded the project after being denied aid from major international lenders.</p>
