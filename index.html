          <p>In the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, Dawn Richard, a former member of Diddy's girl group Danity Kane, testified that Diddy threatened her to remain silent about the alleged abuse of Cassie Ventura. According to Los Angeles litigator John J. Perlstein, Richard's testimony corroborates Ventura's account and supports the prosecution's RICO case by demonstrating a pattern of physical violence and witness intimidation. Richard claimed to have witnessed Diddy attacking Ventura, including an incident involving a skillet of eggs, and stated that Diddy implied there would be consequences if she didn't stay in line.

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a renowned Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, has died at the age of 98. He is celebrated as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, revitalizing male dance and creating productions like 'Ivan the Terrible' and 'Romeo and Juliet' that redefined Soviet ballet. Grigorovich's departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, due to disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first ever dancers' strike at the theatre.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, surged over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, fueled by investor confidence in the company's growth potential in the electric vehicle market.

The funds will be used to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients, as CATL anticipates slower growth in China and sees significant opportunities in the European EV market.

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie, convicted of the 2000 murder of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney, was executed by lethal injection in Indiana, marking the state's second execution since 2009. Ritchie had been on death row for over two decades and expressed remorse for his actions, but his clemency bid was rejected by Governor Mike Braun. His attorneys argued that Ritchie's legal counsel was ineffective and failed to present evidence of his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure. The execution proceeded despite challenges in federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor Co. has announced a 30% reduction in its electric vehicle (EV) technology investment plan through fiscal 2030, decreasing the investment from 10 trillion yen to approximately 7 trillion yen. The decision is attributed to lower-than-expected growth in the EV market and a two-year postponement of new EV facilities in Canada. Honda now projects that EV sales will account for around 20% of total sales in 2030, down from the previously estimated 30%, though they maintain their long-term goal of 100% electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2040.</p>
