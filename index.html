          <p>A recent barrage of Russian drones and missiles devastated parts of Kyiv, tragically killing at least six people, including a six-year-old child, and injuring over 50. One strike obliterated an entire entrance of a residential high-rise, while other vital infrastructure like a hospital, school, and kindergarten were also damaged. This escalation occurred despite US President Donald Trump's renewed threats of sanctions against Moscow, underscoring the persistent and brutal nature of the conflict. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called it a "horrible morning," urging "maximum pressure" on Moscow through sanctions, noting Trump's earlier patience with Putin.</p>

The incident, which NATS resolved within 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, led to over 150 flight cancellations and widespread disruption, expected to last days. Airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, expressed "extreme disappointment" and called for the CEO's resignation, citing a similar outage in 2023.

          <p>Nvidia's China-bound H20 AI chips are facing increased scrutiny from Beijing's Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) over potential national security risks. The CAC summoned Nvidia officials to clarify and provide documentation regarding alleged security vulnerabilities, including "tracking and positioning" and "remote shutdown" technologies. This inquiry follows reports of serious security issues and calls from U.S. lawmakers for mandatory tracking features on advanced chip exports. The article notes this adds another geopolitical challenge for Nvidia, balancing U.S. policies with its lucrative China market.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a new agreement with Pakistan, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves." Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the US, a significant reversal from a potential 29% tariff. Details remain scarce, including specific tariff rates and the identity of the chosen oil company. This article notes the deal comes shortly after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on India and criticized its trade with Russia, suggesting a strategic realignment in the region, with Trump even suggesting Pakistan could someday sell oil to India.</p>

The British firm Nscale and Norwegian energy company Aker will jointly design and build the facility, with OpenAI buying capacity. This ambitious project aims to deploy 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by late 2026, making it one of Europe's largest data centers, powered entirely by renewable energy. The initiative aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI" and expands OpenAI's global AI infrastructure efforts, following similar plans in the U.S. and UAE.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned remarks by Spain's Transport Minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids."

          <p>This article, a commentary piece, argues that the recent EU-US trade deal signifies Europe's "Suez moment," a humiliating capitulation to American pressure akin to Britain's 1956 crisis. It contends the EU made significant concessions, accepting 15% tariffs on most exports to the US while eliminating its own small tariffs on US goods. Critics, particularly from France, labeled the agreement an "admission of weakness" and an "imperial tribute." The article suggests the deal undermines the EU's goal of strategic autonomy, deepening its economic and security dependence on the US.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initiated their trade deadline activity with a minor three-team deal involving the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski and reliever Paul Gervase, along with catcher Ben Rortvedt, while sending minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. Serwinowski, a left-hander ranked as a top Reds prospect, is seen as an intriguing addition to the Dodgers' farm system. This article notes that despite this initial move, the team is still actively seeking more impactful additions, particularly for their bullpen and outfield, in a competitive seller's market.</p>

          <p>UK high streets are grappling with an "endless battle" against criminal gangs profiting from illegal tobacco and vape sales, as highlighted by extensive shop closures in Newport. This article reveals that 3,624 shops across Britain had illegal goods seized in 2024-25, often involving forced labor, illegal workers, and links to broader criminality like drug dealing and even acid attacks. Local authorities face limited powers, with many closed shops quickly reopening or relocating. The trade deprives public services of significant revenue and creates fear among residents and legitimate businesses, who call for stronger legislation and resources.</p>

          <p>Top Texas Democrats are vehemently criticizing a new GOP-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, arguing it is "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic." The proposed map, endorsed by President Trump, aims to convert five currently Democratic-held U.S. House districts into GOP-leaning seats, potentially expanding the Republican House majority. Democrats allege the plan intentionally fractures minority representation, particularly Black and Latino communities, and violates the Voting Rights Act. This article highlights the contentious political battle over redistricting, with warnings of a "dangerous domino effect" nationwide if such partisan gerrymandering proceeds.</p>
