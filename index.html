          <p>Rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy sustained a shoulder injury during the Kansas City Chiefs' season opener against the Los Angeles Chargers in Brazil, forcing him out of the game. The injury occurred after a collision with teammate Travis Kelce just three plays into the match. Worthy, a key offensive weapon expected to step up due to Rashee Rice's suspension, was seen in immediate pain and did not return, raising concerns for the team's early season prospects.</p>
