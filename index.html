          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has entered the competitive open-source AI field by making its Ernie 4.5 models publicly available on the platform Hugging Face. This marks a strategic shift for the company, whose founder previously argued that closed models like their own would remain superior to open-source alternatives. The release includes ten variants, ranging from small to extremely large parameter models, as Baidu aims to compete with emerging rivals like DeepSeek. The company claims its models show superior performance on various benchmarks, signaling a new phase in China's AI development race.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate surprisingly decreased to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target and fueling expectations of further rate cuts. The drop was more significant than analysts had forecast, providing positive evidence that inflationary pressures in the Eurozone may be sustainably easing. Despite this optimistic development, some economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile external factors, such as energy prices, continue to pose risks. The ECB is expected to proceed cautiously with its monetary policy in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has proposed significant budget cuts for 2025, reducing its development aid ministry's funding to â‚¬10.3 billion, a nearly one billion euro decrease from 2024. This marks the second consecutive year of reductions and comes amid a global trend of donor countries scaling back, including the United States under President Trump. The cuts are particularly sharp in humanitarian emergency aid, which will be slashed by 53%. Aid organizations have criticized the move as short-sighted, arguing it undermines Germany's global responsibility at a time of increasing conflict and displacement worldwide.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer was forced to scale back the plans after over 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against them, citing concerns that the changes would harm vulnerable disabled people. The revised bill will now limit cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and will not freeze the health-related component of Universal Credit. Despite the changes, some MPs remain opposed, arguing the reforms still require substantial savings with an unknown poverty impact.</p>

However, the deal notably excludes steel and aluminum, which still face a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline.

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response compared to an existing shot in a late-stage clinical trial. These positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the stand-alone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combo vaccine pending this flu efficacy data. With these new findings, Moderna plans to resubmit its applications later this year, hoping for approvals in 2026 and positioning itself as a front-runner in the combination vaccine market.</p>

          <p>Losing a job in one's early 60s presents unique financial and emotional challenges, including age discrimination in hiring and proximity to retirement without full Social Security eligibility. This article outlines a strategic approach, advising individuals to immediately file for unemployment, assess emergency funds, and secure health insurance through options like COBRA or the marketplace. For the medium term, it suggests pursuing gig work or part-time jobs to preserve savings while continuing the job search. Longer-term strategies include re-evaluating retirement portfolios for lower risk and considering downsizing or early Social Security claims if necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new historical analysis argues that the United States, currently facing its own democratic challenges, could learn from the political traditions of Latin America. The article reviews historian Greg Grandin's book, which posits that Latin American republics have a rich history of grounding their constitutions in collective social good, in contrast to the U.S. focus on individual rights. Many early Latin American independence movements were tied to abolishing slavery and guaranteeing social welfare, ideas that later influenced international human rights law. This perspective challenges the conventional narrative of U.S. superiority and suggests the region offers valuable lessons in building a more just society.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of people are living long enough to become great-grandparents, leading to a rise in four-generation families and a new caregiving dynamic. This has created what sociologists term the "club-sandwich generation," individuals who find themselves caring for their own aging parents, their adult children, and their grandchildren simultaneously. While the presence of great-grandparents offers families a valuable connection to their history and lineage, it places immense strain on the middle generation. This demographic shift highlights a societal challenge where caregiving responsibilities are expanding without adequate policy support for families stretched thin.</p>

The three European powers urged Iran to resume full cooperation with the nuclear watchdog in line with its legal obligations.

This article argues that while these regions were once a safety valve for the national housing market, their rate of new construction has fallen by more than half in the last 25 years. The slowdown is attributed not to a lack of demand, but to the same restrictive zoning laws and NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) opposition that plagued coastal cities.

In an interview, she explains that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are crucial pieces of information that create their entire perception of reality. Horowitz notes that dogs can even perceive the passage of time through the fading of scents, meaning a person's presence lingers in a room long after they've left.

This article examines the credibility of this threat, noting that while Iran and its proxies have a history of conducting assassinations and attacks abroad, a direct strike on the US homeland is a high-risk contingency. Experts suggest that while Iran almost certainly maintains clandestine cells for surveillance and targeted operations, activating them for a major attack would be an act of desperation, as Tehran currently appears to be seeking de-escalation.</p>

          <p>The chicken finger chain Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in annual U.S. sales, becoming the nation's third-largest chicken restaurant behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its simple, unchanging menu and a strategy of operating its own restaurants rather than franchising, ensuring quality control. Cane's system sales reached $5.1 billion last year, more than doubling since 2021, fueled by rapid expansion to over 900 locations. Founder Todd Graves has ambitious goals to make it a top 10 restaurant brand with over $10 billion in annual sales.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Warns Global Population Decline is Approaching Faster Than UN Projects</h2>

          <p>A new analysis suggests that global fertility rates are falling much faster than official United Nations projections indicate, meaning the world's population could begin to decline decades earlier than expected. Economist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde points to plummeting birth rates in middle-income countries like Colombia and Chile, which are now far below replacement levels and significantly lower than UN estimates. The article argues the UN's model is overly optimistic, assuming fertility rates will rebound or stabilize. If current trends continue, the global population may start shrinking as early as 2055, posing severe economic challenges worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Commentary: Los Angeles Sparks Continue Decline on Candace Parker's Jersey Retirement Day</h2>

          <p>A sports column reflects on the continued struggles of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, framing their recent loss as another symptom of the "Candace Curse." The loss occurred on the same day the team retired the jersey of superstar Candace Parker, whose departure in 2020 coincided with the franchise's five-year downturn. The article contrasts the team's past glory, including a championship with Parker, against its current state of lacking talent, direction, and playoff hopes. It argues that mismanagement by the ownership group allowed the two-time MVP to leave, initiating a spiral from which the once-storied franchise has yet to recover.</p>
