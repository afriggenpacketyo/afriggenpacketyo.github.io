          <h2>Palmer Luckey Envisions Autonomous AI Weapons as Future of Warfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 19:02:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of the defense technology company Anduril, champions AI-powered autonomous weapons as the inevitable future of warfare, asserting that current U.S. military technology is often overpriced and outdated. Anduril develops systems like the Roadrunner drone and the Fury unmanned fighter jet, which utilize artificial intelligence for surveillance, target identification, and engagement, significantly reducing the need for human operators in high-risk situations. Luckey contends that these "smart weapons" ultimately promote peace by creating a strong deterrent, though critics, including the UN Secretary General, have labeled lethal autonomous weapons as "morally repugnant." His company has rapidly grown, securing over $6 billion in government contracts worldwide, demonstrating a significant shift in defense procurement and a belief in technology's transformative power in global security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nine Palestinian students in Gaza, including Chevening scholars, have received UK government emails regarding their evacuation to pursue university studies, a significant first since the ongoing war began. Mahmoud, a 27-year-old doctor, describes the scholarship as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" but faces the heart-wrenching decision of potentially leaving his family behind amidst constant displacement, famine, and severe insecurity in Gaza. This development follows months of intense campaigning for over 80 students with UK university offers, many of whom hold fully funded scholarships. While a positive step, the message offers no guarantees, leaving dozens of other deserving scholars in limbo and raising concerns about unequal prioritization for those desperately trying to escape the dire conditions.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has recognized over 70 medical miracles in 163 years, drawing millions of pilgrims annually who seek miraculous recoveries. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates claimed cures, requiring sudden, complete, and lasting recoveries with no current medical explanation. Since 2022, two additional miracles have been acknowledged, bringing the total to 72, including documented cases like Vittorio Micheli's osteosarcoma recovery and Sister Bernadette Moriau's Cauda Equina cure. Despite historical skepticism regarding scientific rigor, independent analysis has found the office's conclusions credible, underscoring the meticulous documentation and patient scrutiny involved in such extraordinary recognitions.</p>

          <p>Anduril Industries CEO Brian Schimpf unveiled the Fury, an unmanned fighter jet designed to operate autonomously using artificial intelligence, signaling a major advancement in combat technology. This collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) is intended to work alongside manned planes, detecting and engaging enemies to protect human pilots, and is part of a U.S. Air Force development contract. Co-founder Palmer Luckey defends the concept against "killer robot" criticisms, arguing for "smart weapons" to save American lives, while assuring human intervention via a "kill switch" is always available. Fury, scheduled for its first test flight this summer, utilizes readily available commercial components to facilitate mass production, representing a new and potentially safer paradigm for future aerial warfare.</p>

Bayoumi, an alleged Saudi intelligence operative with ties to two hijackers, is believed to have conducted pre-operational surveillance of the Capitol, a likely target of Flight 93. Retired FBI and CIA officials express anger and surprise over the information being withheld, suggesting it could have aided the investigation and prevented the attacks. The evidence, uncovered during a lawsuit by 9/11 families, challenges the original 9/11 Commission's findings and raises serious questions about intelligence failures.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, alleging France was not doing enough to combat antisemitism, a diplomatic move deemed "unacceptable" by the French Foreign Ministry. France firmly rejected these allegations, stating that authorities are fully mobilized against rising antisemitic acts since the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas, and that such acts are "intolerable." The ministry criticized Kushner's actions as violating international law and undermining the transatlantic partnership and trust between allies. This diplomatic discord follows Macron's rejection of similar accusations from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and highlights ongoing tensions in French-U.S. relations, including disagreements on trade and UN peacekeeping efforts.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a prolific figure who spent decades backstage on Broadway as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 productions, has died at 96, leaving behind a remarkable legacy. He later pivoted to a successful acting career in his 60s, notably playing the iconic Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler, who hailed from a family deeply rooted in Jewish and Yiddish theater, initially doubted his acting potential. His career resurgence, sparked by a casting director's hunch, saw him work consistently for over 30 years in film and television, proving his belief that "retirement is a road to nowhere" and securing his place as an enduring performer.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Donald Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local leaders' authority. This plan follows deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, drawing fierce criticism from Democrats, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who call it an "abuse of power" and a "flagrant violation of our constitution." Trump, however, claims Chicago residents are "screaming for us to come" to address crime, despite local data showing significant drops in violent offenses. The Pentagon confirmed planning is underway for National Guard mobilization to assist ICE with "logistical support and clerical functions" in 19 mostly Republican states.</p>

          <p>In an escalation of President Trump's law enforcement crackdown in Washington D.C., some National Guard members deployed in the city will now be armed, a directive issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This decision reverses previous guidance that troops would not carry weapons, despite declining violent crime rates in D.C. and no reported threats requiring such measures. Nearly 2,000 National Guard members, including hundreds from Republican-led states, have been stationed in the city to protect landmarks and assist with crowd control.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration for treating intelligence as a "loyalty test" rather than a safeguard for the country.

          <p>A Black conservative influencer from Chicago, Danielle Carter-Walters, claims she inspired President Trump's recent comments about deploying federal troops to Chicago, citing her advocacy through her organization, Chicago Flips Red. Trump had stated "beautiful African-American ladies" in red hats were asking him to intervene in Chicago's crime. Carter-Walters defended Trump's D.C. crackdown, believing federal presence deters crime. However, Trump's threats to deploy troops to Democratic-led cities like Chicago have drawn robust criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Scott, who denounce it as tyrannical overreach and a political circus unwelcome in their city.</p>

Cramer highlights key sectors for investment, including housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, viewing them as beneficiaries of the "don't fight the Fed" mentality. He also discusses the non-monolithic nature of "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, upcoming earnings reports from Nvidia and CrowdStrike, and the political influence surrounding the Intel saga.

          <p>California faces a conflict between child-care advocates and the legal cannabis industry over a proposed tax cut that could reduce funding for social services. An industry-sponsored bill seeks to lower the cannabis excise tax from 19% back to 15% for six years, which would reduce annual state revenue by $180 million, including $81 million for subsidized child-care slots. Child-care advocates argue against the cut, emphasizing the critical need for funding amidst federal cuts and existing waiting lists. The debate highlights the instability of funding essential services with "sin taxes" and the challenge of balancing struggling industries with vital social programs.</p>
