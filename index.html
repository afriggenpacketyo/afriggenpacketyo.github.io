          <h2>China Prioritizes Yuan Stability Amid Tariff Pressures</h2>

          <p>Despite heightened trade tensions and US tariffs, China's central bank is signaling a preference for yuan stability over devaluation, setting the currency's daily reference rate at a four-month low but carefully avoiding breaching the 7.2 benchmark against the US dollar. Analysts interpret this move as a deliberate effort to stabilize the yuan rather than devalue it to offset the impact of tariffs. Standard Chartered's Ding Shuang suggests the central bank will likely maintain this strategy until further tariff announcements. This indicates China's intent to project economic stability amid trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of new US tariffs, investors are seeking safe haven assets, with analysts highlighting the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as prime candidates. The yen's undervaluation, coupled with expectations of declining US interest rates, makes it attractive, while the Swiss franc benefits from its traditional safe-haven status. Some analysts also suggest exploring "exotic" hedges like the Brazilian real. Investors are also moving towards bonds and gold as safe alternatives during these times of economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar has deepened the nation's political turmoil amidst an ongoing civil war, with analysts doubting any lasting ceasefire will emerge. While the ruling junta has declared a state of emergency and requested international aid, experts believe the deep-seated tensions between the junta and resistance forces make meaningful dialogue improbable. Analysts predict the junta will exploit the earthquake's aftermath to weaken resistance capabilities, despite declaring a temporary ceasefire for humanitarian efforts. The disaster highlights the complex interplay of natural disasters and political instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Lloyds Bank is facing accusations from business customers and whistleblowers that it failed small firms by reducing lending after the 2008 financial crisis. Allegations suggest that the bank's Business Support Unit (BSU) wrongly categorized salvageable businesses as distressed, leading to their collapse. Lloyds denies these allegations, asserting that its BSU supported thousands of customers. The accusations raise questions about the bank's commitment to supporting small businesses during a critical period for the UK economy.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using bonus structures to incentivize employees to return to the office, with some firms withholding bonuses for those who don't meet minimum attendance requirements. This trend reflects a shift from offering workplace perks to enforcing stricter attendance policies. While some executives argue that in-office work improves cooperation and creativity, many employees prefer remote work and question the fairness of these mandates, especially when executives themselves may not adhere to them. This approach highlights the ongoing tension between employers and employees regarding remote work arrangements.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is considering how to respond to the global economic turmoil caused by US tariffs, balancing the need for retaliation against the potential costs to UK consumers. While retaliation could be popular domestically and align Britain with its G7 counterparts, it could also harm relations with the EU, a more significant trading partner. The government hopes to mitigate the impact by supporting businesses and avoiding higher prices for consumers, but the decision carries both economic and political risks. The UK's approach will shape its position in the evolving global trade landscape.</p>

          <h2>Senior Venture Capitalists Leaving Big Firms Due to Changing Industry Dynamics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many senior venture capitalists are leaving large firms due to perceptions of slow decision-making and a focus on managing larger pools of money rather than working with promising founders. Some are starting their own smaller funds to capitalize on industry changes and have more control over their investments. The rise of technology platforms and increased comfort among limited partners in investing in solo managers are facilitating this trend. Some departures are also due to underperformance and the consolidation of the venture capital industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the deportation of a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador was "wholly lawless," citing a lack of evidence supporting allegations of gang affiliation. The judge ordered the Trump administration to bring the man back to the United States. The Justice Department has placed an attorney on leave after he conceded that the deportation should not have occurred. The case raises concerns about due process and the government's authority to deport individuals without proper justification.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering closing the Community Relations Service, a Justice Department office created during the civil rights movement to prevent and resolve racial and ethnic tensions. Former leaders of the agency fear that its closure could lead to increased disputes between police and minority communities. The agency has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. The proposed reorganization raises concerns about the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in US cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As stock prices and futures plummet due to rising trade tensions, exchanges may implement trading halts using market "circuit breakers." These halts are designed to provide a cooling-off period during extreme market volatility to prevent crashes. S&P futures and Russell 2000 futures have already triggered these measures. Understanding how these circuit breakers work is crucial for investors navigating the current market uncertainty.</p>

The marathon, an annual event celebrating the birth of Kim Il Sung, was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reopening, though limited, signals a gradual easing of North Korea's strict border controls, previously allowing only Russian tourists into the capital.
