          <h2>Trump Administration Faces Lawsuit Over Student Visa Terminations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 05:02:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups in Georgia, challenging the termination of legal statuses of 133 international students. The lawsuit alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending the students' statuses and making them deportable. A federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order, requiring the administration to reinstate the students' statuses and preventing the use of their identities outside the lawsuit, with a hearing set for Thursday. The lawsuit claims the actions coerce students into abandoning their studies and 'self-deporting', despite not violating their status.</p>

          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists indicates a growing concern that the United States is transitioning away from liberal democracy toward authoritarianism. The Bright Line Watch survey reveals a significant drop in the rating of American democracy following President Trump's election and into his second term. Scholars point to tactics such as expanding executive power, attacking the media, and undermining checks and balances as indicators of this shift. While some disagree, arguing Trump is addressing long-standing issues, many democracy experts express alarm over the administration's actions, drawing parallels to competitive authoritarian systems in countries like Hungary and Turkey.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have reported promising results from a phase 1 trial of a stem cell therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. The therapy involves transplanting neurons derived from donated stem cells into the brains of patients, aiming to restore dopamine production. After 18 months, the injected cells had successfully integrated into the brain with no serious side effects, and patients experienced noticeable improvements in symptoms, particularly those receiving a higher dose. The FDA has approved a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group scheduled for 2025, and while there are limitations, early findings are suggestive of a strong promise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case regarding the extent to which public schools must accommodate religious objections to curriculum materials, specifically concerning LGBTQ+ content in elementary school storybooks. Parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, object to the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters in storybooks, arguing that it conflicts with their religious beliefs and infringes upon their right to guide their children's values. The school board contends that accommodating opt-out requests is logistically challenging and disruptive, while legal experts debate whether the courts or local school boards should ultimately decide curriculum matters. The conservative-leaning court may favor religious objectors, potentially requiring opt-outs for religious reasons.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly investing in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a hedge against geopolitical tensions and market volatility, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Gold's significant gain this year has outperformed other asset classes, attracting substantial inflows into mainland-domiciled gold ETFs. Analysts suggest that gold is replacing US Treasuries and the dollar as a safe haven for investors, with some predicting further price increases. This trend reflects a broader shift in investor sentiment, with a growing preference for precious metals amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto's state visit to China signals a strategic shift as Western support wanes and Beijing seeks to strengthen its influence in the Global South. Ruto is expected to seek funding for key infrastructure projects, including the extension of the Standard Gauge Railway and a major highway project. This visit marks a departure from Ruto's initial West-leaning stance, driven by the failure to secure funding from the US and Europe, coupled with the challenges posed by US trade tariffs. Observers note that Ruto is seeking new markets, project financing, and investors amid trade tensions with the United States.</p>

He is currently playing in the Zone 22 scouting league and hopes for another shot at the majors.

          <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees may face difficulties as the Trump administration's reduction in force has led to cuts in the ranks of caseworkers who assist with coverage problems.

With ACA enrollment at an all-time high and upcoming changes to the health law, the caseworker cuts could exacerbate existing challenges for consumers.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to freeze federal grants worth billions of dollars, claiming the move is unlawful and would hamper critical disease research. University President Alan M. Garber announced the lawsuit, stating that the $2 billion funding freeze would affect studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The lawsuit alleges the withholding of federal funding violates Harvard's constitutional rights and is being used as leverage to control academic decision-making.

          <p>China's economy shows signs of improvement due to the government's stimulus package implemented in September 2024, with GDP growth reaching 5.4% in the first quarter. Policymakers have recognized the need to address falling demand, particularly in the real estate market, by allowing local governments to expand debt financing through long-term bonds. The central bank is maintaining faster credit growth but is cautious about lowering policy rates. Stabilizing the property and stock markets is crucial to mitigating the slowdown in consumer spending, requiring local governments to purchase unsold residential buildings and state-owned institutions to buy back shares.</p>

Proposed solutions include flipping the draft order to reward teams closest to the playoffs, implementing a draft lottery similar to the NBA, waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier, and establishing a salary pool system where teams negotiate with prospects. These ideas seek to balance parity, player agency, and the league's competitive landscape, with the goal of creating a more equitable and engaging system for all stakeholders.</p>

          <p>The US State Department has advised allies to refrain from using Chinese satellite services, citing concerns that they could be used to gather military information and sensitive intelligence. A leaked memo reveals that officials were instructed to warn countries that working with Chinese space providers could advance Beijing's foreign policy goals and risk the transfer of sensitive data. The memo suggests that Chinese satellite companies may create monopolistic markets controlled by Beijing, jeopardizing national security, business secrets, and citizens' privacy.</p>

          <p>The global housing crisis is being intensified by climate change-driven disasters, with extreme weather events and natural disasters eroding available housing stock and driving up prices. Climate gentrification is occurring in coastal cities as high-income individuals move to higher elevation areas, displacing low-income residents. Post-disaster, housing becomes even more expensive, with insurance costs skyrocketing in high-risk areas. Experts argue for increased housing supply, city planning that emphasizes low-risk areas, and climate-forward retrofitting to ensure affordability and climate resilience.</p>

Many car parks require users to input their registration when purchasing a ticket, but numerous cases have emerged where drivers who entered their registration correctly still received a ticket. Campaigners estimate that thousands have been affected by this issue, which involves "sticky keys" or machines that accept payment before the full registration is entered. The RAC is calling for the reintroduction of a Government-backed code of conduct to address the problem.</p>
