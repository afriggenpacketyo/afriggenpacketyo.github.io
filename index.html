          <p>Multiple explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works south of Pittsburgh resulted in two fatalities and at least ten injuries. Emergency crews responded to the incident on Monday morning, with a recovery effort concluding after the final missing employee was found deceased. The plant has since been stabilized, and an investigation into the cause of the blasts, which occurred in a mechanical regulator room, is underway. State and local officials have expressed their condolences and are monitoring the situation, while a temporary stay-at-home order for nearby residents has been lifted.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take legal action against Apple, accusing the company of anticompetitive behavior related to its App Store rankings. Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing his own xAI's Grok chatbot. The threat was made on social media platform X, where Musk questioned why his apps were not featured in Apple's "Must Have" section despite their popularity. This follows his previous criticism of Apple's plan to integrate OpenAI's technology at the operating system level.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The move comes after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following a weak July jobs report, which he claimed without evidence was manipulated. Antoni has a history of criticizing the BLS's methodology and has received backing from influential figures like Steve Bannon. The nomination has sparked concern among some economists about the potential politicization of the agency responsible for crucial economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has urged the government to adopt a balanced approach to regulating the country's fiercely competitive "quick commerce" sector. He argued against curbing competition and instead advocated for guiding the industry away from excessive cash burn towards sustainable, high-quality development. Wang highlighted that the rapid delivery sector creates new consumption opportunities vital for long-term growth. His recommendation is for policymakers to foster innovation and quality upgrades rather than pursuing a zero-sum, restrictive mindset to manage the industry's intense rivalry.</p>

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located and euthanized a mountain lion on the property; DNA samples are being used to confirm it was the animal responsible for the attack.</p>

          <p>Two armed suspects led authorities on a chaotic two-hour pursuit across Los Angeles County, carjacking three separate vehicles and managing to escape. The chase began in Lancaster with the theft of a pickup truck and involved the suspects later stealing a big rig, which they drove the wrong way on the 10 Freeway. After abandoning the big rig, they carjacked a third vehicle before ultimately fleeing on foot in downtown Los Angeles. Authorities recovered a loaded firearm from one of the stolen vehicles and believe additional suspects may have been involved in the escape.</p>

          <p>According to newly released FBI documents, a Democratic whistleblower alleged that Representative Adam Schiff approved the leaking of classified information to discredit former President Donald Trump. The whistleblower, reportedly a longtime staffer for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, made the claims to the FBI in 2017, calling the actions illegal. The documents state the staffer attended a meeting where Schiff allegedly greenlit leaking derogatory, classified information to be used to indict Trump. The report, published by Just The News, is based on documents recently provided to Congress by FBI Director Kash Patel.</p>

Under the agreement, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on certain Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices," including market access and national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The city of Huntington Park, California, a predominantly Latino community, is experiencing significant economic and social disruption due to residents' fear of increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. A local council member described the city's main commercial street as a "ghost town," with many businesses locking their doors during operating hours to protect customers. The fear of deportation has led to a sharp decline in foot traffic and commerce, which is expected to negatively impact the city's sales tax revenue.

          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard is being analyzed as a political move rather than a necessary response to a crime wave. This article from The Atlantic argues the action is based on misleading and outdated crime statistics from 2023, ignoring the significant drop in violent crime seen throughout 2024 and 2025. The move is framed as a public relations stunt that creates a dangerous precedent for using federal forces in American cities against the wishes of local governments.

          <h2>Jim Cramer Defends Trump Administration's Revenue-Sharing Deal with Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD</h2>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has commented on the Trump administration's agreement with Nvidia and AMD, which requires the companies to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. In exchange, the firms receive licenses to export their products, a reversal of previous restrictions. Cramer argued the deal is not novel, comparing the 15% cut to another form of tariff that benefits the U.S. Treasury. While acknowledging a "debatable" pay-to-play element, he views the decision to allow sales to China as more significant than the revenue mandate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is contending with two large wildfires, with more than 1,000 firefighters deployed to combat the blazes amid dry and windy conditions. The Lee fire has grown to become the fifth-largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to extreme drought and volatile fuel loads. A second major blaze, the Elk fire, has burned over 14,000 acres but is partially contained. The fires have forced evacuations in several counties and prompted air quality warnings due to heavy smoke, highlighting the explosive start to this year's fire season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's justification for federalizing D.C. police is based on a false narrative of rampant crime, similar to tactics he has used for other Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles. The article points out that violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, directly contradicting the president's portrayal of a city in chaos. It highlights that while D.C. did see a homicide spike in 2023, crime rates have fallen dramatically since. The report suggests this is a pattern of using misleading claims about crime and homelessness for political purposes.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned it is at risk of collapse after the government threatened to withdraw its funding. In a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission, employees raised concerns about a "toxic internal culture" and alleged misuse of public funds. The crisis was reportedly triggered by UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who urged the institute to pivot towards defense research and overhaul its leadership or risk losing its £100m grant. The institute stated it is undergoing organizational changes to deliver on its national role.</p>

          <p>England footballer Jess Carter has spoken about the intense fear of racist abuse she and her Black teammates face, particularly concerning penalty shootouts. She expressed a sense of relief when white teammates also missed penalties during the Euro 2025 quarter-final, fearing that if her teammate Lauren James had been the only one to miss, the racist backlash would have been "astronomical." Carter, who was a target of online racism during the tournament, said the abuse makes her feel small and not valuable. She also revealed that the psychological impact made her scared to play in the final.</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman who secretly marked his burial site with a Red Bull can. The woman, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, was the new girlfriend of Alexander McKellar, who confessed to her that he and his twin brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. After McKellar showed her the remote location, Muirhead dropped the can as a marker and later informed police. This crucial clue led authorities to recover Parsons' body and brought the case to a close.</p>

          <p>An analysis from Sky News suggests President Trump's recent actions and words reveal how central Russian President Vladimir Putin is to his political narrative. During a press conference about deploying the National Guard in D.C., Trump mistakenly said he was "going to Russia on Friday" for his summit with Putin, when the meeting is actually in Alaska. The article argues this gaffe, combined with the timing of the D.C. crackdown, shows Trump positioning himself as a bold leader before the talks. The summit will be a bilateral meeting, with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy excluded from the direct negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" and describing a "constructive discussion" just days after demanding his immediate resignation. The change in tone followed a meeting between Trump, his cabinet members, and Tan. Last week, Trump had called the CEO "highly CONFLICTED" following questions from Senator Tom Cotton about Tan's ties to China. The reversal comes as the Trump administration takes an active role in the semiconductor industry, recently striking a deal with Nvidia and AMD regarding their sales to China.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix for film and television projects. This new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all content and covered overhead costs.

The renewal will also support Meghan's lifestyle brand, As ever, which was developed in partnership with the streaming giant and includes a new season of her cooking show.</p>
