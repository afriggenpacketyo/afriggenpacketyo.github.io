          <p>Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill," a major tax and spending package. During the event, he promoted plans for the nation's 250th anniversary, which include a "Great American State Fair" and a UFC championship fight to be held on the White House grounds. The article notes that the legislation extends tax cuts and increases spending on defense and border security, while cutting funds for health and social programs. Trump's speech also included controversial remarks and repeated claims of a stolen election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strike by sanitation workers in Birmingham, UK, has entered its sixth month, leading to "apocalyptic" piles of uncollected rubbish throughout the city. The industrial action, initiated by the Unite union over proposed role downgrades linked to equal pay liabilities, has resulted in the suspension of recycling and green waste collections. Residents are expressing frustration over the persistent stench and overflowing bins, with some storing recycling in their homes out of principle. Birmingham City Council has yet to reach an agreement with the union to end the dispute.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he understands what motivates U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a connection built on shared family values. Starmer revealed that Trump personally called to offer condolences after the death of his brother, which helped forge a good personal relationship despite their political differences. The prime minister credits this rapport with helping to secure a vital deal to exempt UK industries from some U.S. tariffs. He emphasized the importance of building strong relationships with international leaders for the UK's national interest.</p>

          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market, accusing it of extensive market manipulation. The regulator issued an interim order freezing over $566 million in what it claims are illegal gains from the firm's activities. SEBI alleges that Jane Street used a manipulative strategy involving large-scale stock and futures trades to artificially influence India's Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices for profit, despite a prior warning from the National Stock Exchange. Jane Street has disputed the findings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive spending and tax package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by Donald Trump, has passed Congress and awaits his signature. The legislation is a major political victory for Trump, funding many of his campaign promises through significant tax cuts, increased defense and immigration control spending, and incentives for fossil fuels. However, the bill is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Critics and nonpartisan analysis suggest it will also lead to millions losing health insurance coverage and food aid due to stricter eligibility rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken a person into custody after they crossed the heavily fortified border from North Korea. The individual, who was unarmed, crossed the Military Demarcation Line in the central-west section of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Thursday. The person was safely guided out of the mine-filled area and is now being investigated by relevant authorities to determine their identity and reasons for crossing. The Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that no unusual military movements were detected from the North Korean side following the incident. Border crossings are rare due to the extreme danger.</p>

          <p>An infant was injured in Victorville, California, after its mother allowed her 12-year-old child to move the family car. The mother was standing nearby holding the infant when the 12-year-old, while attempting to park, caused the car door to strike her. The impact made the mother fall and drop the baby, who sustained head injuries and was airlifted to a medical center for treatment. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident, which they have referred to as "cruelty to a child," and the mother could potentially face criminal charges.</p>

          <p>Veteran advocates, legal scholars, and military family organizations are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to U.S. cities like Los Angeles erodes democratic norms. Critics argue the move violates the spirit of the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from being used for civilian law enforcement. They contend that placing service members in such roles pits them against American citizens in situations they are not trained for, risking excessive force and eroding public trust. Speakers at a news conference described the policy as putting an unnecessary strain on military families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions constitute the largest and most rapidly growing segment of the population in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the 56,000 people currently detained by ICE do not have a criminal record. This trend marks a significant shift, particularly since recent ICE enforcement actions began targeting 3,000 arrests per day. The data contradicts administration claims that the focus is primarily on violent criminals and highlights the impact of the mass deportation campaign on long-term residents.</p>

          <p>An American teenager's attempt to become the first pilot to fly a small Cessna plane to all seven continents has been stalled after he was detained on an island in Antarctica. Ethan Guo, 19, was taken into custody by Chilean authorities on King George Island after allegedly submitting a false flight plan. Chile's civil aeronautics agency stated that Guo's deviation from his filed plan activated security alerts, and he now faces charges for violating the country's aeronautical code. The incident creates a major delay in his highly-publicized journey, which is also a fundraising effort.</p>

          <p>Staffing cuts and a hiring freeze at the National Park Service are raising safety concerns at popular summer destinations like Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore. Visitors are encountering shuttered lifeguard towers and warnings that no lifeguards are on duty, which local officials fear could lead to drownings. Advocacy groups report that the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration took office and has filled far fewer seasonal positions than needed. The cuts are a result of a White House push for personnel reductions across the federal government, creating potential risks for millions of park visitors.</p>

The letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment by weakening regulations and cutting funds. The agency responded by accusing the employees of "unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda and has initiated an administrative investigation. This action represents a rare and significant escalation in the conflict between career civil servants and political leadership at the agency.</p>

Fuyao University of Science and Technology, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, founded by semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, are attracting significant attention. These institutions are part of a new philanthropic trend among Chinese entrepreneurs aimed at advancing the country's goal of "scientific self-reliance." Observers predict these well-funded, specialized universities could soon become highly selective and compete with top public institutions for the nation's brightest students.</p>
