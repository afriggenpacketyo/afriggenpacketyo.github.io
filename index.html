          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has announced a $5.5 billion plan to support the country's exporters affected by new U.S. tariffs. The package includes credit lines and tax postponements for businesses impacted by the duties, which President Trump imposed in response to the legal situation of his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro. President Lula has criticized the tariffs' justification as non-existent but stated that Brazil prefers negotiation over escalating the conflict, emphasizing the need to protect the nation's sovereignty without worsening relations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Florida's wildlife commission has unanimously approved the state's first black bear hunt in ten years, scheduled for December. Officials cite the need to manage a growing bear population and increasing human-bear interactions as the primary reasons, pointing to science-based decision-making. However, the plan faces strong opposition from environmental groups and activists, who argue the hunt is cruel and that the real problem is human encroachment on bear habitats. Critics also point to the chaotic and poorly managed 2015 hunt as a reason for concern about this revived event.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move could force conspiracy theorist Alex Jones off the air and lead to the sale of the Infowars brand and property. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction, viewing this as a final step toward accountability for Jones's harassment. The decision shifts the process out of federal bankruptcy court, where a potential sale to the satirical site The Onion was previously halted.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariffs are causing significant price hikes on imported goods like coffee, tea, and spices, putting immense pressure on small businesses such as cafes and specialty food retailers. Owners report that surging costs, up by as much as 25% since January, are eroding their already thin profit margins and forcing them to pass the increases on to consumers. Importers of these goods have limited ability to source from other countries, leaving them stuck with higher costs. This situation threatens the viability of small, independent brands that prioritize quality but lack the stockpiling capacity of larger competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

While the 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. a local government, Congress retains ultimate control.

          <p>The landmark national security trial of Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai is now in its final stage with closing arguments underway. The 77-year-old founder of Apple Daily, who also holds British citizenship, faces a potential life sentence on charges of colluding with foreign forces. His case is widely seen by international observers and critics of Beijing as a key indicator of the erosion of free speech and judicial independence in Hong Kong under the national security law imposed by China in 2020.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues California Governor Newsom Must Resist Trump's Pressure on UCLA</h2>

          <p>An opinion column argues that California Governor Gavin Newsom faces a critical decision in how UCLA responds to pressure from the Trump administration, which has frozen over $500 million in federal grants. The administration is demanding a settlement of around $1 billion over claims of antisemitism and "woke" policies. The author contends that capitulating would not only harm a vital public institution but also damage Newsom's potential presidential ambitions. The column frames the situation as a crucial test of California's ability to resist authoritarian pressure on academic freedom and higher education.</p>

          <p>Record-level flooding from a glacial lake outburst was largely contained in Juneau, Alaska, thanks to newly installed temporary barriers along the Mendenhall River. The flood, caused by a release from the ice-dammed Suicide Basin, crested at a new record height but did not cause the widespread home damage seen in previous years. Officials credited the 10,000 reinforced sandbag-style barriers with protecting hundreds of properties. These annual floods have intensified due to climate change, which is causing the Mendenhall Glacier to recede and altering the stability of the natural ice dam.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decided 2-1 that the humanitarian nonprofits who sued were not eligible to bring the challenge, stating that only the Government Accountability Office can legally contest the withholding of funds under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. The ruling is a major blow to aid organizations and is expected to have a severe impact on global health programs, including those for HIV/AIDS prevention.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, according to new rankings from Sportico. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team was last in the league with a valuation under $1 billion while in St. Louis. The surge in value is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and development of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which has become a global hub for sports and entertainment. The valuation reflects the team's success in monetizing the new venue and building a strong corporate and fan base in Los Angeles. (not investment advice)</p>

International aid organizations have condemned the use of starvation as a weapon of war, but convoys are unable to enter.
