        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued on Thursday, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, Bitcoin's price surged, possibly due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The rally was also supported by macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, reinforcing Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Additionally, positive regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act, and pro-crypto stances from U.S. leaders contributed to the market's bullish sentiment.</p>

          <p>South Africa is experiencing shock and anger following President Cyril Ramaphosa's meeting with President Donald Trump, where Trump presented videos and articles promoting a "white genocide" conspiracy theory. Despite the "serious provocation," Ramaphosa maintained composure, drawing praise from South African media and citizens, although some wished he had responded more assertively. Trump repeatedly pushed the narrative of systematic persecution of white South Africans, misrepresenting videos and articles to support his claims. The South African delegation attempted to debunk the disinformation, with some members challenging Trump's assertions directly, while the presence of white South African golfers at the meeting sparked controversy.</p>

          <p>Brazilian federal police agents investigating a Kremlin spying operation uncovered that Russian spies obtained seemingly authentic Brazilian birth certificates. Forensic analysis suggested the documents were not forged but filed in the names of fictitious newborns during the last years of the Soviet Union by K.G.B. operatives. The investigators suspect this audacious tactic aimed to provide future generations of spies with legitimate identities to continue operations against the West. Experts suggest that such long-term planning aligns with Russian espionage culture, which prioritizes creative, generational strategies over immediate gains, although some Western intelligence officials remain skeptical.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant decline after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. The legislation ends tax credits for installers like Sunrun that lease equipment to customers, impacting a substantial portion of the rooftop solar industry. Analysts described the bill as a "worse than feared" scenario for clean energy, as it takes a "sledgehammer" to the Inflation Reduction Act. While First Solar, a major U.S. solar panel producer, was less affected due to the manufacturing tax credit remaining relatively unscathed, the overall outlook for solar stocks is currently negative.</p>

The reforms aim to ease prison overcrowding, although early releases will not be permitted for the most serious offenders. The government also confirmed it would expand a pilot scheme offering chemical castration to some prisoners, with a view to making it nationwide and potentially mandatory.</p>
