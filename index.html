          <p>The ringleader of a grooming gang in Rochdale, known as 'Boss Man', has been jailed for 35 years for sexually assaulting two schoolgirls. Mohammed Zahid, 65, was convicted along with six other men for a series of sexual offenses committed between 2001 and 2006. The court heard that the victims, who were as young as 13, were treated as 'sex slaves' and exploited in various locations after being manipulated with drugs, alcohol, and gifts. This case highlights a prolonged period of severe abuse and the subsequent delivery of justice for the survivors.</p>

          <p>The Oktoberfest festival in Munich was shut down after police received a bomb threat linked to a deadly explosion at a residential building in the northern part of the city. Authorities stated a letter from a perpetrator connected the two incidents. The explosion, which killed one person, was reportedly the result of a domestic dispute where the building was deliberately set on fire. Police discovered explosive devices at the scene, prompting the closure of the festival grounds as a precautionary measure while special forces worked to defuse the bombs.</p>

          <p>A major Super League play-off semi-final is in jeopardy after Wigan Warriors announced that their opponent, Leigh Leopards, does not intend to fulfill the fixture. The dispute reportedly stems from Leigh chairman Derek Beaumont's dissatisfaction with what he considers an 'unacceptable' ticket allocation for the match. Despite the uncertainty and the official statement from Wigan, both teams have named their 21-man squads for the game. The controversy has created significant confusion just days before the scheduled high-stakes contest for a place in the Grand Final.</p>

While historical shutdowns have had minimal long-term economic impact, analysts note that a prolonged stalemate could raise concerns about the credit quality of U.S. debt, potentially leading to higher yields in the future.

          <p>Residential electricity rates across the United States have surged over 30% since 2020, outpacing general inflation and placing significant financial pressure on consumers. The price spike is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, and delays in grid infrastructure development. These high costs disproportionately affect low-income households, forcing many to choose between paying utility bills and other essential expenses. While the trend of rising prices is expected to continue, long-term shifts toward electrification and energy efficiency may eventually help reduce overall household energy spending.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. plummeted by 21% last week after interest rates rose to a three-week high.

The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.46%. This sharp decline in refinancing activity highlights the market's sensitivity to rate fluctuations and suggests that opportunities for homeowners to lower their monthly payments may be short-lived.

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on a spending bill. The impasse centers on a bitter dispute over healthcare spending, with Democrats refusing to support a Republican bill without an extension of health insurance subsidies. As a result, non-essential government services will halt, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed without pay. Essential services like border protection and air traffic control will continue, but workers will not be paid until the shutdown ends.</p>

          <p>Peruvian authorities have detained the suspected mastermind behind the brutal, livestreamed murders of two women and a teenage girl in Argentina. The suspect, a Peruvian national known as 'little J,' allegedly operated a drug gang and ordered the killings as a 'warning' over a supposed drug theft. The crime, which involved the torture and murder of the three victims, was broadcast to a private social media group, sparking shock and widespread protests across Argentina. This arrest marks a significant development in a case that has highlighted the issue of narco-femicide in the country.</p>

          <p>A new study on Jewish life in Germany reveals a significant increase in fear, social isolation, and psychological distress since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks in Israel. Respondents described a rise in antisemitic incidents in their daily lives, from graffiti to confrontations at work and school, leading many to hide their Jewish identity for safety. The report highlights a perceived lack of empathy from the broader German society and paints a grim picture of the current climate. Germany's anti-discrimination commissioner called for stronger legal protections in response to the findings.</p>

          <p>A new proclamation by President Trump imposes a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, a move that two immigrant professors argue will severely damage U.S. innovation and economic growth. In an opinion piece, they contend that skilled immigrants are vital for creating new ventures and filling critical STEM roles, especially amid a global race for AI dominance. Rather than restricting access, they propose expanding the H-1B program and distributing visa holders more broadly across the country to foster economic prosperity in underserved regions and maintain America's competitive edge.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated his intention to change how international laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted in UK courts for asylum cases. The goal is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers and foreign criminals from using claims about inferior prison or healthcare systems in their home countries to block their deportation. Starmer argued that while genuine refugees should be protected, the legal framework must adapt to the current challenges of mass migration, a position that has drawn scrutiny from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Residents of Altadena, California, are raising concerns over the ongoing removal of trees damaged in the recent Eaton fire, arguing that many trees showing signs of life are being cut down prematurely. The community, known for its lush tree canopy, has already lost an estimated 50% of its trees to the fire and initial cleanup efforts. The debate pits the county's safety assessments against residents' desires to preserve what remains of the area's natural character and the windbreaks that they believe helped protect some homes from the blaze.</p>

          <p>Despite scorching demand for housing, new apartment construction in Los Angeles is grinding to a halt, with the number of units under construction set to hit a decade low. Developers report that it has become nearly impossible to build profitably due to a combination of factors, including rising material costs from tariffs and a lack of investment capital. Major institutional investors are reportedly 'redlining' Los Angeles, wary of the city's complex and changing regulations, which makes it difficult to predict financial returns and secure the necessary funding for new projects.</p>

          <p>California's upcoming special election features Proposition 50, a measure that would redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Democrats for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. This move is a direct response to Republican-led efforts in states like Texas to create maps favorable to their party, escalating a national fight over redistricting that could determine control of the U.S. House. If passed, the proposition would temporarily override the map created by California's independent commission, a departure from the state's widely praised nonpartisan process.</p>
