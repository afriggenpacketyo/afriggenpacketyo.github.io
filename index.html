          <p>The Taliban has dismissed former U.S. President Donald Trump's call to regain control of Bagram Air Base, which the U.S. vacated during its 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump had suggested ongoing talks and issued a threat of "BAD THINGS" if the base was not returned. A Taliban spokesman cited the Doha Agreement, urging the U.S. to respect Afghanistan's territorial integrity and adhere to its commitment not to use or threaten force. The statement emphasizes Afghanistan's focus on an economy-oriented foreign policy and constructive international relations.</p>

          <p>With a federal funding deadline of September 30 approaching, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is pressing President Trump to engage in bipartisan negotiations to prevent a government shutdown. Previous funding proposals from both parties failed in the Senate, increasing the likelihood of a lapse in government services. Democrats are insisting that any funding bill include an extension of enhanced tax credits from the Affordable Care Act, a point of contention with Republicans. Both sides are positioning to blame the other should a shutdown occur. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities have arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau and charged him with second-degree murder in the death of 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Witnesses reported hearing the shooter yell "free Palestine" before opening fire and being subdued by a guest who struck him with a chair. Investigators are still determining a motive and have stated there was no known connection between the suspect and the deceased victim.</p>

          <p>Manchester City was denied a key victory against Arsenal after a 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. City manager Pep Guardiola adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead, a tactic that nearly secured the win. The match, described as a "slugfest," saw City record the lowest possession percentage of any Guardiola-managed team in his career. The result leaves both teams trailing league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League table.</p>

          <p>Abbe Lowell, an attorney who previously represented Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, has voiced significant concern about the current Trump administration's impact on the U.S. system of government. Lowell stated he has "never been as concerned" about whether the nation's institutions can withstand the pressure being applied by the executive branch. He warned that the President's actions in his second term could break the constitutional separation between the courts and executive power. Lowell has since founded a new law firm to combat what he terms government "over-reach."</p>

Senator Chris Murphy stated the U.S. is "quickly turning into a banana republic" as the federal government is being used to punish political enemies.

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government sees as a "no-brainer for growth." The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport projects a boost in jobs and the local economy, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups. Critics argue the expansion will increase noise and air pollution and undermine the UK's climate change commitments.</p>

Despite a weekend of mistakes from both drivers, team principal Andrea Stella noted the car was not well-suited to the Baku circuit.

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director in the first Trump administration, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded in recent months. Speaking on CBS, the current IBM vice chair pointed to a slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 jobs per month to less than 50,000. He attributed this to companies cutting labor costs to protect margins amid rising input costs, moving from a labor-hoarding phase to aggressively managing expenses. Cohn's assessment aligns with the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates, citing a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting Collins Aerospace, a provider of airline check-in and baggage software, has caused a second day of significant disruption at several European airports, including London Heathrow and Brussels. The failure of the 'Muse' software system on Saturday forced staff to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins, leading to hundreds of delays. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as there is no clear timeline for a secure resolution. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry to digital system failures affecting multiple airlines simultaneously.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2003, Great Britain's athletics team has failed to win a single gold medal at the World Athletics Championships, held in Tokyo. The team concluded the event with a total of five medals, their joint-lowest count since 2005, finishing 21st in the medal table. Key medal hopes were hampered by injuries, and the team also failed to secure any relay medals for the first time in two decades. The performance marks a significant downturn from the 10 medals won at both the previous World Championships and the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p>

          <p>Conservation group The Big Cat Project has shared remarkable footage of two rehabilitated Amur tigers being released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive sibling tigers reacting with intense fury, snarling and attacking the doors of their cages as they are opened, highlighting the raw power of the predators. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be living in the wild. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their habitat from poaching and loss.</p>

The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1,500m semifinals earlier in the competition for jostling. He stated after the race that he felt he had been "robbed" in the earlier event and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Luke Donald, has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the New York crowd at Bethpage if they underperform. His comments come as the American players will each receive a $500,000 payment for participating, a controversial move that breaks from the tradition of playing for free, which the European team continues to uphold. Donald theorized that with high ticket prices, fans might be more inclined to turn on a paid team that isn't delivering a winning performance. Europe aims to defend the trophy they won in Rome two years ago.</p>

The directive is part of a broader effort to limit reporters' movements within the facility, which houses the newly renamed Department of War. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated the press does not run the Pentagon and must follow the rules. The move has been denounced by press freedom organizations and some Democratic lawmakers as an assault on independent journalism and an affront to free speech.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests President Trump's urgency in pressuring Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political rivals is driven by his declining public support. The article argues that as economic pressures like rising grocery prices and stalled job growth mount, public tolerance for corruption diminishes. With falling approval ratings, even among Republicans, Trump may feel a need to consolidate authoritarian power before the 2026 elections. This puts officials like Bondi in a difficult position, weighing the risks of defying the president against the potential legal consequences if his power fades.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has approved an 8% cut to the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, reducing it to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged the reduction of €910 million comes at a time of increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over 4 million people will lose food aid as a result. The move is part of a wider trend among Western donor countries to reduce financial contributions to multilateral aid systems. (not investment advice)</p>
