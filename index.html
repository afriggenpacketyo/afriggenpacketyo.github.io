          <p>An Israeli airstrike has reportedly killed at least 20 Palestinians and wounded dozens at a popular seafront cafe in western Gaza. According to eyewitnesses and medics, the Al-Baqa Cafeteria, an outdoor venue used by journalists and local residents, was struck by a missile, leaving a large crater. This attack is part of a wider wave of Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, which has led to further displacement of families. The incident occurs amid stalled ceasefire negotiations and increasing international pressure on Israel to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

The firefighters were responding to a small brush fire on Canfield Mountain when they came under gunfire. Following an hours-long manhunt involving approximately 300 law enforcement officers, the suspected gunman was found deceased on the mountain with a firearm nearby.

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol in 1967. The case, which remained unsolved for nearly six decades, is believed to be the oldest cold case ever solved in the United Kingdom. Mrs. Dunne was found strangled in her home, and the investigation was recently reopened, leading to a breakthrough. Modern DNA testing on a semen swab from the original crime scene linked Headley, a previously convicted sexual offender, to the murder.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a major campaign finance case concerning whether federal limits on coordinated spending between political parties and their candidates violate the First Amendment. The case, brought by Republican committees, challenges a 50-year-old law and could lead to more money flowing into politics, following previous decisions like Citizens United. Unusually, the Justice Department under the Trump administration has sided with the challengers, arguing the limits are unconstitutional. A decision is expected before the 2026 midterm elections and could significantly alter the landscape of political fundraising. (not investment advice)</p>

Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance the bill with a simple majority, aiming to pass it before a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

The succession is a critical issue, as Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama chooses his reincarnation, while the Chinese government sees him as a separatist and may attempt to name its own successor.

While the news may signal that inflation is being brought under control, some economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain risks.

          <p>The German government's draft budget for 2025 includes substantial cuts to its development aid, with the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development set to receive nearly a billion euros less than in 2024. This marks the second consecutive year of reductions and comes at a time of growing global crises and displacement. Aid organizations have criticized the move as short-sighted, warning that it will have a severe human cost and undermine Germany's global responsibilities. The cuts also mean Germany's official development assistance will fall below its internationally recognized target of 0.7% of gross national income.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly agreed not to deport a key cooperating witness in the federal human smuggling case against Kilmar Ábrego García. The witness, José Ramón Hernández Reyes, who has a criminal record, has been identified by prosecutors as a crucial cooperator in the investigation. Ábrego García's case gained national attention when he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being returned to the U.S. by a Supreme Court order. The deal with the witness highlights the administration's efforts to build its case against Ábrego García, a flashpoint in the contentious debate over U.S. immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a second spell of unusually high temperatures for June, with forecasts predicting highs of 34°C (93°F), prompting analysis of the role of climate change. Climate scientists state that while a "heat dome" is the immediate cause, the intensity of such events is inevitably boosted by the warming climate. Data shows that days exceeding 32°C are now more than three times as common as they were in the late 20th century. Experts warn that this trend will continue, highlighting the need for the UK's infrastructure to adapt to more frequent and severe heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States that cuts import tariffs on certain goods has officially come into force. The agreement provides British car and aerospace manufacturers with preferential access to the U.S. market, reducing duties and potentially saving the sectors hundreds of millions annually. However, the deal notably excludes steel and aluminum, which remain subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by a July 9 deadline. This lack of resolution on steel is causing significant uncertainty and frustration for UK producers in that industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The Treasury Committee report highlighted that the 25% withdrawal penalty for early access not related to a first home purchase or retirement effectively claws back the government bonus plus 6.25% of the saver's own contributions. The committee also raised concerns that the product's dual purpose is confusing for consumers and that its rules unfairly penalize those on certain state benefits. There are growing calls to reform the product, including raising the £450,000 property price cap. (not investment advice)</p>
