          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas has directed her first film, "My Mother's Wedding," drawing inspiration from profound personal losses in her childhood. In a recent interview, she discusses how the deaths of her father and stepfather, both Royal Navy pilots, shaped her creative process and led her to write a story about a family she never had. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, explores themes of grief and family dynamics as three daughters reunite for their mother's third wedding. Thomas also reflects on her acclaimed acting career, from her early shyness to roles in "The English Patient" and "Slow Horses."</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of the Gaza Strip to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This measure applies to Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, aiming to address the severe hunger crisis as warned by food experts and the United Nations. While aid agencies welcome the step, they reiterate that a full ceasefire is necessary to prevent famine and ensure supplies reach all of Gaza's 2.1 million people. The pause comes amid continued fighting in other areas and reports of dozens of new casualties from Israeli strikes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapper Drake has cancelled his scheduled Monday concert in Manchester, citing "unforeseen ferry schedule and travel logistics" as the reason. The performance at the Co-op Live arena has been rescheduled for August 5th, with all original tickets remaining valid for the new date. This cancellation was part of his global tour, which had already included two successful shows in the city over the weekend. The last-minute announcement has drawn criticism and frustration from many fans, some of whom described the short notice and reason for the postponement as a "joke" and a "lame excuse."</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party would seek to ban all NHS doctors from striking if they win the next election. The proposal would introduce minimum service level legislation, placing doctors under similar restrictions to police and military personnel. The announcement comes as resident doctors engage in a five-day strike over pay, with the British Medical Association (BMA) arguing that wages have fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008. Badenoch criticized the BMA as increasingly "militant" and framed the proposed ban as a necessary step to protect patients and public finances.</p>

While small groups of pro-Trump demonstrators gathered, a major security operation is in place around the resort. Trump is also scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney during his trip, which has drawn anti-Trump protests in other cities.</p>

          <p>French companies are being forced to adjust their strategies in Africa as France's long-standing political and military influence, known as 'Francafrique,' collapses, particularly in the Sahel region. Countries like Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso are increasingly rejecting their former colonial power, creating a more competitive landscape where nations like China, Russia, and Turkey are gaining ground. French corporate market share has plummeted, and major firms like nuclear company Orano have faced operational suspensions and revoked licenses. In response, French businesses are shifting towards more indirect strategies, such as local partnerships and joint ventures, to maintain a presence without provoking political backlash.</p>

However, legal experts and commentators question what Maxwell could offer now and whether her testimony can be trusted, given she previously faced perjury charges for allegedly lying under oath.

          <p>This article presents a deep analysis of Donald Trump's psychology, arguing that his actions are primarily driven by an insatiable avarice, or an extreme greed for money. This desire is expressed through a relentless focus on 'dealmaking,' which serves to build his brand and personal wealth, regardless of whether the deals are successfully completed. The author contends that Trump's approach bypasses traditional market mechanisms, using personal, adversarial negotiations to generate publicity and profit. This 'egonomics' connects his narcissistic needs directly to financial gain, with policies like tariffs being tools to dominate a global prestige economy, ultimately positioning him to secure more personal wealth through ventures like cryptocurrency.</p>

Domestically, Starmer is also under pressure to recognize a Palestinian state, a move his Conservative opponents argue is ill-timed as it would "reward" Hamas for its recent attacks.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Launch Billboard Campaign Blaming Trump for Rural Hospital Closures</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has erected billboards near struggling rural hospitals in red states with the message: "If this hospital closes, blame Trump." This political tactic aims to hold the Trump administration responsible for gutting rural healthcare, citing over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). While Republicans included a $50 billion rural health fund, analyses suggest it will cover only a fraction of the losses. The campaign highlights the financial strain on rural hospitals, hundreds of which are at risk of closure, directly impacting Trump's own voter base.</p>

          <p>After enduring the pandemic and a rise in anti-Asian violence, Oakland's historic Chinatown is now facing a new challenge: the economic impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Merchants in the vibrant district, one of the oldest in the country, report that while customer traffic remains steady, consumer spending has dropped significantly on imported items like specialty foods, teas, and furniture. One long-time supermarket owner noted that costs have risen by an average of 50 percent due to the tariffs. This has forced customers to cut back on purchases, adding financial pressure to the small businesses that define the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that the political and economic climate under Donald Trump has inadvertently revived interest in socialism in the United States. It traces the decline of socialist ideas after the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of a pro-market consensus in the West. However, growing economic dissatisfaction, exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, created an opening for anti-capitalist sentiment. The author argues that Trump's presidency, characterized by cronyism and rhetoric that vilifies free exchange, has discredited market economics for many, especially younger Americans, making once-fringe socialist policies seem like viable alternatives to a system perceived as corrupt.</p>

          <p>Greece is battling five major wildfires across the country, including on the islands of Kythira and Evia, amid a persistent and severe heatwave with temperatures forecast to reach 44°C (111°F). Firefighters have been working through the night, but high winds continue to fan the flames, and the risk of new fires remains extremely high. The blazes have already caused injuries to firefighters, destroyed property, and burned significant forest areas, prompting new evacuation alerts. In response to the escalating situation, Greece has formally requested assistance from the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism for additional firefighting aircraft.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the near-disappearance of comprehensive arts and event listings from publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, arguing their loss has damaged cultural ecosystems. The author recalls how these listings once served as a vital guide for discovering emerging artists and niche subcultures, helping to launch careers and build audiences. The shift towards algorithm-driven social media and 'poptimist' journalism, which focuses on already-famous celebrities, has created a feedback loop that starves lesser-known artists of visibility. The piece argues that the loss of curated listings is not just a blow to artists but also to the historical record of a city's cultural life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that the practice of tipping in America has fraught historical origins tied to the post-Civil War era. The system proliferated as a way for employers, particularly in the restaurant and service industries, to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers, shifting the cost to the customer. This led to the creation of the federal 'tipped minimum wage,' currently frozen at $2.13 per hour since 1991, which legally requires customer tips to make up the difference to the standard minimum wage. An analyst from the Economic Policy Institute notes that this system is poorly enforced, leaving workers vulnerable to wage theft and consumer frustration.</p>

          <p>Beijing has sharply criticized a failed recall vote in Taiwan, labeling the effort as "political manipulation" that goes against the will of the people. The vote, backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), unsuccessfully targeted 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. A spokesperson for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of provoking political strife and attempting to suppress dissent to create a one-party monopoly. The statement reflects the ongoing tensions across the Taiwan Strait, as Beijing continues to exert pressure on the island, which it considers a renegade province.</p>

          <p>A recent poll and hundreds of reader responses reveal that many Americans are postponing major life milestones like marriage, homeownership, and having children due to economic stress and political anxiety. High inflation, soaring home prices, and student loan debt are significant financial barriers, while uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policies on tariffs and reproductive rights adds to the instability. Many feel the 'American Dream' is now a farce, with some planning to move to different states or even leave the country in search of a better future.

Under 'enhanced vetting' policies, visitors have few rights to refuse a search of their electronic devices.
