          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, is in the United States illegally according to the Department of Homeland Security. Soliman, who allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw an incendiary device into the crowd, entered the U.S. on a B2 visa in August 2022, which expired in February 2023, and subsequently filed for asylum. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, and Soliman is being held on a $10,000,000 bond, facing felony charges including use of an incendiary device and possible first-degree murder, though no fatalities have been reported. The victims, aged 52 to 88, were hospitalized with burns. The situation remains under investigation by the FBI.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a decline in other European countries, driven primarily by the popularity of the revamped Model Y. Despite the sales boost, a recent survey indicated that 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla due to political reasons, likely related to Elon Musk's support for the MAGA movement. Norway's EV incentives, such as VAT exemptions and access to bus lanes, also contribute to the surge in sales. The surge in sales is attributed to the firm's revamped model Y SUV, suggesting that a first batch of deliveries appears to have taken place in May, with more coming in June.</p>

          <p>Despite Chris Sale recently being recognized as the fastest to reach 2,500 career strikeouts, Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell holds the all-time record for strikeouts per nine innings at 11.1679.

Snell's high strikeout rate was a key factor in the Dodgers' decision to sign him to a five-year, $182 million contract, though he is currently on the injured list. The Dodgers have a history of valuing pitchers with high strikeout rates, with several of their pitchers ranking among the all-time leaders in strikeouts per nine innings.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing an aviation crisis due to infrastructure problems and understaffed air traffic control. Radar and radio communication systems have faced intermittent outages, leaving air traffic controllers overworked and stressed. An aviation safety writer for The Verge suggests that the problems at Newark are systemic and foreshadow issues that other airports may face. These issues include staff retention, training, and the rising cost of living outpacing air traffic controllers' salaries, leading to burnout and mandatory overtime.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer's chief executive, Stuart Machin, saw his yearly pay increase to £7 million before a cyber attack disrupted online orders and contactless payments. The increase was primarily due to share awards resulting from meeting performance targets, including profit growth. While the remuneration committee considered the cyber incident, they concluded that no adjustments to Machin's performance-related pay were needed, though they will revisit the matter next year. The company expects the cyber attack to impact profits by £300 million, but is accelerating digital transformation plans to reinforce cyber defenses.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul for a second round of U.S.-brokered peace talks, aimed at ending Russia's invasion. The talks occurred shortly after Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Ukraine is calling for a 30-day ceasefire, while Russia insists on maximalist war goals, including the annexation of Ukrainian regions and a block on Ukraine's NATO accession. Despite these ongoing talks, both sides continue to engage in military actions, including drone and missile attacks.</p>

          <p>Farid Mehralizada, a journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), faces up to 12 years in an Azerbaijani prison for explaining economics in a way that ordinary people can understand. He was violently abducted and charged with "conspiring to smuggle foreign currency," followed by additional charges of "illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery." His trial has brought back difficult memories for his RFE/RL colleague, Alsu Kurmasheva, who spent nine months in a Russian prison on similar charges. The charges against Mehralizada are typical of those leveled against journalists and civil society actors in Azerbaijan's crackdown on dissenting voices.</p>
