          <p>This article previews the highly anticipated Premier League match between Newcastle United and Liverpool, emphasizing the intense atmosphere expected at St James' Park, particularly for Newcastle's first home game of the campaign. A central narrative involves the Alexander Isak transfer saga, with Liverpool as a suitor for the Newcastle striker, adding significant tension to the fixture. The piece also details Liverpool's prior acquisition of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle had long pursued, further fueling the rivalry and complicating Newcastle's striker recruitment. Eddie Howe aims to harness crowd energy while focusing on the game, acknowledging Newcastle's formidable home record against traditional top teams.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. This moderation was attributed to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside reduced electricity and gas costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore forecasts continued moderate inflation and slower economic growth in the latter half of the year, influenced by easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. The central bank has already eased monetary policy twice this year to navigate a "downshift" in the global trade environment and rising trade tensions, signaling a path of weaker growth.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has vehemently criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, labeling it an unconstitutional affront to his appointment powers that effectively gives Democrats veto power over his judicial and U.S. Attorney nominees. He publicly urged Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon his defense of the century-old custom and expedite the confirmation of strong Republican candidates. Trump's frustration is amplified by a significant slowdown in judicial confirmations this term compared to his first. The article notes a recent court ruling against an acting U.S. Attorney, further intensifying Trump's efforts to reshape the federal judiciary and legal landscape.</p>

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., have been authorized to carry their service weapons starting Sunday night, a significant escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses previous guidance that troops would not be armed. While the exact locations and missions remain undisclosed for security reasons, the Joint Task Force-DC stated that force would only be used as a last resort in response to imminent threats. The move comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, despite local officials disputing the president's claims of rising crime.</p>

          <h2>Labor Markets Shift to 'Great Stay' and 'No-Hire, No-Fire' Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:14:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global labor markets are experiencing a significant shift from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay," characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" approach from employers. Economic insecurity and uncertainty are driving this trend, as companies delay hiring decisions without necessarily reducing headcount, and workers remain in their current roles. This phenomenon is observed in both the U.S., where nonfarm payroll growth has slowed, and the U.K., which has seen a decline in job vacancies. Experts attribute these changes to economic uncertainty, higher labor costs, and a reluctance by firms to let go of hard-to-replace talent. (not investment advice)</p>

A long-standing government commitment to dual the entire stretch by 2025 has been significantly delayed by a decade to 2035, drawing widespread criticism from campaigners.

          <p>Some Starbucks employees express significant dissatisfaction with their working conditions, citing low pay, erratic scheduling, and a perceived disconnect between corporate goals and employee needs. Baristas like Liberte Locke and Samantha Cole highlight struggles with inadequate wages, inconsistent hours, and the company's "just-in-time" scheduling practices, which disrupt personal lives and make it difficult to secure a living wage. Despite Starbucks offering benefits like healthcare and stock grants, workers feel their voices are not heard and that a corporate focus on cost-cutting has eroded the company's stated commitment to its "partners." Starbucks acknowledges the need for reform and is seeking feedback.</p>

          <p>India fears China's planned mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet could drastically reduce water flows by up to 85% during the dry season, impacting over 100 million people downstream. This concern has prompted India to fast-track its own Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam project to mitigate potential effects and counter any weaponization of the river by its strategic rival. Local resistance in Arunachal Pradesh, fearing submersion of villages, has hindered India's dam plans for years. The situation highlights escalating geopolitical tensions over water resources and the environmental impact of large-scale infrastructure projects in a seismically active zone.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency due to its infant mortality rate rising to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average and its highest in over a decade. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who die at more than twice the rate of White infants. The state's plan includes expanding prenatal services, regionalizing obstetric care, and strengthening community health programs, focusing on improving maternal health. Experts highlight that structural inequities, poverty, and limited healthcare access, exacerbated by federal funding cuts and Mississippi's non-expansion of Medicaid, are key drivers of these preventable deaths.</p>
