          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, sparking a legal battle. Illinois and Chicago leaders have filed a lawsuit, arguing there is no crisis warranting the troops' presence, and a federal judge is set to hear arguments on a temporary restraining order. This deployment is considered novel, as a National Guard from one state has not typically been federalized and sent to another. The situation highlights tensions between federal and state authorities over the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Candidates vying for California governor in 2026 engaged in in-depth interviews, addressing critical issues like Proposition 50 and congressional redistricting, immigration, homelessness, and affordable housing. While most Democrats supported Proposition 50, aimed at redrawing districts to favor their party, Republicans criticized it. The article highlights candidates' diverse stances on current Governor Gavin Newsom's policies, with some praising his economic efforts and others critiquing his handling of high-speed rail or the pandemic.

Portions of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico could receive up to 4 inches of rain, leading to scattered flash flooding. Priscilla is expected to continue weakening and become a remnant low by Friday, but dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding remain a concern.</p>

          <p>China has formalized and tightened its export rules for rare earth elements and their processing technologies, which are vital for high-tech products. The new regulations from the Ministry of Commerce restrict the export of mining, smelting, separation, and magnetic material manufacturing technologies without government permission. This move is expected to impact foreign arms manufacturers and some semiconductor firms, with licenses unlikely to be issued to them. As China holds a near monopoly on rare earth extraction and refining, these controls intensify trade tensions with the US and could affect global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleged that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim the White House immediately dismissed as "baseless and reprehensible." The U.S. military has conducted at least four strikes on alleged drug boats, killing "narco-terrorists," as part of the Trump administration's anti-drug trafficking efforts. Petro's accusation adds to mounting scrutiny of these strikes, which critics argue lack congressional authorization and risk escalating international tensions.

The deal means ABB will no longer pursue a spin-off of its robotics business. This strategic move aligns with SoftBank's broader vision to position itself at the forefront of the AI boom through various investments and acquisitions in technology. (not investment advice)</p>

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton described the group as "abortion-loving radicals" who endangered patients, reinforcing his commitment to enforcing the state's strict abortion laws. Rojas herself was previously charged under the Texas Human Life Protection Act.

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, now in its "first phase," outlines an immediate end to fighting, a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The plan calls for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 other Gazans. Gaza would then be demilitarized and governed by a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" under an "International Stabilization Force." While Israel's Netanyahu supports the plan, Hamas's full response and the long-term implications for Palestinian statehood remain key points of discussion.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan has restricted access to major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, on multiple mobile providers, according to global internet monitor NetBlocks. This follows the Taliban's 2022 ban on TikTok and a recent nearly 48-hour total internet suspension across the country. Users in Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif reported needing VPNs to access the blocked platforms, while others experienced slow or intermittent service. Although the Taliban has not officially confirmed the restrictions, rights groups have criticized previous internet cuts for their serious implications, particularly for women and girls.</p>

          <p>Anxiety is growing in Portland, Oregon, as President Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard to quell protests have intensified, despite a federal judge blocking the deployment. Trump's rhetoric, describing Portland as "war-ravaged" and "burning to the ground," has been criticized by local business owners and residents for damaging the city's image and hindering its recovery from the pandemic and prior social justice protests. While an appeals court temporarily granted federal control over Oregon National Guard troops, their deployment to Portland remains prohibited. The situation underscores a contentious federal-state dynamic and its impact on local sentiment.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning holiday decorations should shop early, as significant shortages of artificial Christmas trees, lights, and wreaths are anticipated due to trade war tariffs. One of the largest importers, National Tree Company, reports bringing in 25% less product and increasing prices by 10%. The CEO warns that while most consumers may absorb the price hike, those at the lower end of the economic spectrum could struggle. This situation, exacerbated by concerns about weaker consumer demand and drastically reduced import volumes, suggests a challenging retail season for seasonal decorative items.

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, showed little enthusiasm for arguments in a case challenging Illinois' voting regulations that allow mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days post-election. Representative Michael Bost, who won his election, claimed harm due to a reduced margin of victory and increased staffing costs. However, justices questioned the sufficiency of his alleged harm, with some suggesting his arguments were based on policy disagreement rather than individual injury. The Court's skepticism highlights the difficulty in establishing standing for candidates challenging election rules, even when they emerge victorious.</p>

Lesley had sued Campbell County officials, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated when they sided with objectors seeking the removal of certain youth books. The county denied her claims, attributing her dismissal solely to performance issues. Lesley expressed vindication, hoping the settlement sends a message to other library districts about upholding constitutional obligations against discrimination.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed national military medical center on Friday, marking his second such visit since returning to the White House in January. The White House press secretary stated the visit is for a planned meeting with troops and a checkup, though specific tests were not detailed. This follows a comprehensive annual physical in April that declared him "fully fit." Recent images of bruising on his hand, attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, had fueled speculation about his health, which Trump has consistently dismissed.</p>
