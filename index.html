          <p>President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, attended by prominent CEOs like Elon Musk and Larry Fink. Attendees reported a packed room and amusing scenes of executives sitting on the floor due to lack of seating, but also noted the president's ability to command the room's attention. Trump delivered a speech focusing on U.S. relations with the region, heavily emphasizing his domestic agenda and legacy, leaving some attendees feeling as if they had attended a Trump rally. The event was perceived as somewhat disorganized but ultimately successful in showcasing the strong relationship between the two leaders. </p>

          <p>A recent resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more agreements where minerals are exchanged for security or trade benefits, a concept called "minerals for muscle." The U.S. seeks to secure critical mineral supplies, challenging China's dominance in the supply chain. Experts suggest potential deals with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while others are skeptical, citing resource nationalism. Canada has expressed a need for trade certainty rather than such an agreement. </p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-backed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking Americans by creating bureaucratic hurdles to healthcare coverage. He contends that these requirements, framed as incentivizing work, are actually a way to remove people from healthcare. Warnock believes providing healthcare encourages work and strengthens the economy, citing a report that millions could lose Medicaid coverage if unable to meet the proposed requirements. Republicans, however, argue these requirements are sensible and prevent subsidizing capable adults who choose not to work. </p>

          <p>The UK government plans to extend the qualifying period for permanent settlement from five to ten years, affecting both new and existing migrants. This move, subject to public consultation, aims to address concerns about a surge in settlement and citizenship applications. The government claims this will make settlement a privilege earned through contribution. Critics argue it is a cruel betrayal, causing uncertainty and trauma for those who have built their lives in the UK. </p>
