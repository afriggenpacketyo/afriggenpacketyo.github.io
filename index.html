          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood has left three men dead and nine others injured, including two minors. Police are searching for three suspects captured on surveillance video and have recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence, suggesting an automatic weapon was used. The incident occurred during a violent holiday weekend in the city, though officials noted that overall homicides and shootings are down year-over-year. Authorities believe there may have been an exchange of gunfire at a gathering of around 40 people.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after an explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, have been recovered. The blast occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, whose home was also destroyed. Federal and state agencies are investigating the cause of the explosion, which also sparked a wildfire that burned about 80 acres.</p>

          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been moved from the ICU to a rehabilitation facility, over three weeks after he and his wife were shot multiple times in their home. His wife, Yvette, who shielded their daughter during the attack, was released from the hospital in June. The shooting is believed to be part of a series of politically motivated attacks that also resulted in the deaths of state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. A suspect has been arrested and faces multiple federal and state charges.</p>

          <p>Flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas have resulted in over 100 deaths and a massive search for missing persons, including children from a summer camp. The disaster was caused by a powerful weather system that dumped extreme rainfall on the flood-prone Hill Country, causing the river to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and effectiveness of their emergency warnings to residents and camps. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the area as recovery efforts continue.</p>

The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which it says has eliminated the need for the planned cuts. The initial proposal aimed to reduce staff to pre-Biden administration levels, which could have meant over 80,000 job cuts.

          <h2>UK Prison Watchdog Warns Drug Smuggling is Destabilizing Jails</h2>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales has warned that an overwhelming amount of drugs smuggled into prisons is destabilizing the entire system. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones to deliver contraband to overcrowded and understaffed facilities, fueling criminality and hindering rehabilitation efforts. The report found that a lack of purposeful activities for inmates contributes to drug use. In one survey, 39% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, a problem the inspector says poses a threat to national security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets organizations primarily engaged in family planning and abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law unconstitutionally singles them out and would have devastating effects on patients who rely on them for non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The ruling temporarily preserves federal funding for the group while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The federal Office for Civil Rights had determined California's inclusive policy violated the rights of female students under Title IX and gave the state a deadline to comply. State officials rejected this analysis, setting up a potential enforcement action from the federal government, which could include withholding federal funding. The confrontation highlights the deep national divide over civil rights protections for transgender students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas serve as a stark warning for California, which faces similar risks from extreme weather, according to experts. California's hilly topography and numerous low-lying areas along rivers make it vulnerable to the kind of rapid, devastating inundations seen along the Guadalupe River. While California's storms are typically different, climate change is increasing the risk of extreme rainfall from events like atmospheric rivers. Experts note that while California may have more robust flood-management regulations, many communities and homeless populations remain in high-risk zones.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries, suggesting the figures are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a final policy. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal is likely to increase U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the tariffs may not be as meaningful as they appear and that other economic factors are also important. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism for inserting language into a Republican spending bill that cut funding for improving weather forecasting systems, just before catastrophic floods devastated his home state of Texas. The cuts eliminated a $150 million fund for research and observation systems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This action, combined with his vacation to Greece during the disaster, has drawn parallels to his 2021 trip to Cancun during a winter storm. Critics argue that defunding these agencies makes such disasters more deadly, while Cruz has dismissed the complaints as "partisan finger pointing."</p>
