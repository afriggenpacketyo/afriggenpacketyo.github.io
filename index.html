          <p>A recently passed tax and spending bill will introduce significant changes affecting millions of Americans, with many key provisions scheduled to take effect after the 2026 midterm elections. The legislation alters Medicaid by imposing new work requirements starting in 2026, which could lead to nearly 12 million people losing coverage by 2034, and also cuts food assistance benefits. For taxpayers, the bill increases the standard deduction and raises the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions for certain households, while eliminating tax credits for electric vehicles and green home improvements.</p>

          <p>A Christian girls' summer camp in Texas, Camp Mystic, became the site of a tragic disaster when the Guadalupe River flooded with little warning, killing at least 59 people, including campers and the camp's director. The floodwaters, which rose rapidly, destroyed low-lying cabins and left a scene of devastation, with 11 campers and one counselor still reported as missing. Survivor accounts describe harrowing scenes as they were evacuated, highlighting the community's shock and grief over the sudden catastrophe. The incident has raised questions about the safety of locating camps so close to the river.</p>

The couple, remembered for their dedication to the community and their students, were vacationing near the hard-hit Camp Mystic area when the floods occurred. Their two children, Lyle and Holland, are still unaccounted for, adding to the profound grief of the community. The tragedy is part of a wider disaster where the death toll has climbed to nearly 70 across Central Texas, with search operations ongoing.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's new tax and spending bill against widespread criticism. Hassett disputed projections from non-partisan bodies that the bill would add trillions to the national debt and cause millions to lose Medicaid, arguing that the administration's economic models predict growth that will offset these costs. He dismissed the Congressional Budget Office's analysis as historically inaccurate. The program also featured Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi, who labeled the legislation the "big, ugly bill," criticizing its impact on the deficit and healthcare costs for ordinary Americans.</p>

The system failed to make an "out" call on a clear long shot from Kartal at a critical moment in the first set, forcing the umpire to replay the point. Pavlyuchenkova, who argued a game was "stolen" from her, expressed frustration that the chair umpire did not overrule the system's error.

Bessent suggested that the boards of Musk's companies, such as Tesla, would likely disapprove of his political activities.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first home victory at a chaotic and rain-affected British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Norris took the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, was given a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. Piastri had led for most of the race but finished second after serving the penalty during his final pit stop. In a surprising result, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg secured his first-ever podium finish in his 239th race, holding off Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton to take third place in front of a record crowd.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that countries without a new trade agreement by August 1 will face the tariff levels announced in April. Bessent clarified that this is not a new deadline but a firm date for implementation, stating that tariffs will "boomerang back" for nations that have not moved negotiations along. This comes as a 90-day pause on the tariffs is set to expire, increasing pressure on U.S. trading partners. Bessent suggested that several major announcements regarding new trade deals could be expected in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior officer in Hamas's security forces has reportedly claimed that the group has lost approximately 80% of its control over the Gaza Strip, leading to a collapse of its command structure. In anonymous messages shared with the BBC, the officer described a state of internal disintegration, with armed clans and criminal gangs filling the power vacuum created by months of Israeli strikes. He stated that the security situation has completely broken down and that Hamas is unable to intervene. The account suggests a significant weakening of Hamas's governance and military capabilities from within the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>Two years after a car crashed into an end-of-term party at a Wimbledon school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls who were killed say they are still fighting for answers. Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau died in the incident on July 6, 2023. The driver, who was arrested, was initially not charged after it was determined she had an epileptic seizure. However, the case was reopened in January, and the driver was rearrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. At a memorial event, the grieving families expressed their frustration with the long wait for accountability.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported a group of eight men to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle that culminated in a Supreme Court decision. The men, convicted of various crimes, were on a flight that was initially diverted after a district judge ruled they must be given a chance to speak with an asylum officer. However, the Supreme Court overturned that ruling, allowing the deportations to proceed despite South Sudan's instability. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, highlighting the administration's policy of deporting individuals to third countries.</p>

          <p>The operator of the Greek oil tanker Vilamoura, TMS Tankers, has stated that an external explosive device was the likely cause of the explosion that damaged the vessel off the coast of Libya last week. Preliminary findings from the investigation point away from an internal malfunction. The tanker, which was carrying around one million barrels of oil, suffered an explosion in its engine room, causing it to lose maneuverability. The incident is the latest in a series of similar attacks on commercial shipping in the region, with maritime security sources suspecting a limpet mine was used.</p>

Decades of political instability have left Libya's medical infrastructure in ruins, with many facilities non-functional and essential medicines unavailable. This forces desperate families to seek treatment abroad, often through perilous means, underscoring a systemic failure to provide basic services and driving a unique form of medical migration.</p>

The proposal comes as a July 9 deadline approaches, after which Washington has threatened to impose a 36% levy on Thai imports if a new deal is not reached. According to Thailand's finance minister, the country is hoping to secure a baseline tariff rate of 10% but would find a rate between 10% and 20% acceptable.

They argue that these dedicated units would provide more rapid and effective responses than traditional forces. The article also proposes integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities, such as AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming, into existing electronic warfare units to address the evolving nature of modern warfare.</p>
