          <p>The London Spirit's winning streak in The Hundred women's cricket tournament has ended with a 33-run defeat to the Trent Rockets. Propelled by an unbeaten 51 from England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the Rockets set a challenging target of 150. In response, the Spirit's batting lineup struggled, collapsing to 116 all out against a strong bowling performance, with spinner Kirstie Gordon taking four wickets. This victory marks the first for the Rockets this season, shaking up the tournament standings and leaving Welsh Fire as the only winless team.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has retracted its plan to introduce a 20% surcharge for wider burial plots following significant public criticism and a BBC investigation. The proposal, which was labeled a "fat tax" by a local funeral director, aimed to address the increased demand for larger graves due to rising obesity rates. Residents and critics argued the policy was discriminatory and would place an unfair financial burden on grieving families. After initially defending the move, the council announced it would not proceed with the controversial extra charges.</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that the death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz at Huntercombe Hospital was an unlawful killing. She was left unsupervised for 15 minutes by a staff member with fake credentials, allowing her to self-harm, and she died two days later in February 2022. The jury cited insufficient staff training and unsuitable care as contributing factors, highlighting systemic failures at the now-closed facility. Her parents, both medical professionals, hope sharing her story will prompt necessary changes in children's mental health services.</p>

The fugitives are accused of a long-running conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl into the United States. In a coordinated effort, the Treasury Department also announced economic sanctions, and the State Department offered rewards totaling $26 million for information leading to their arrests.

          <p>Perplexity AI's symbolic $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser has intensified the spotlight on the tech giant's ongoing antitrust challenges. The bid comes as Google awaits a judge's decision on remedies following a monopoly ruling, with the Department of Justice having previously suggested divesting Chrome. This situation has led analysts to re-evaluate the worth of Alphabet's individual components, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo, in the event of a forced breakup. The move underscores the significant hurdles Google faces from regulators while it simultaneously invests heavily in AI.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, dropped 15% after it announced that increased tariffs will significantly impact its profits in the upcoming fiscal year. The company projects that new duties, including those resulting from the suspension of the de minimis rule for small imports, will cost approximately $160 million. Despite anticipating continued sales growth, this forecast has led to a conservative earnings outlook that fell below analyst expectations. The announcement highlights the broader challenge retailers face in mitigating the financial pressures of recent trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in nearly ten months. This marks the fourth straight week of declines, offering a potential boost to the housing market by increasing purchasing power for prospective buyers. The drop in rates is linked to falling yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, influenced by speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Despite the recent dip, economists generally expect mortgage rates to remain above 6% for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent replacement of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner with a politically aligned economist has raised serious concerns about the future reliability of U.S. economic data. This article argues that the damage may already be done, not through direct data manipulation, but by eroding public trust. Confidence in the bureau's independence is crucial for encouraging businesses and households to respond to the surveys that form the basis of key reports like the monthly jobs numbers. A decline in survey participation, driven by a belief that the government is not interested in the truth, could severely compromise data quality.</p>

          <p>Four years after seizing power in Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has solidified its control and is slowly breaking its international isolation. Russia has officially recognized the Taliban government, while China maintains close economic and political ties, driven by the need for Afghanistan's raw materials for its Belt and Road Initiative. Meanwhile, some Western nations, including Germany, are engaging with the regime on a technical level to facilitate deportations. Despite this engagement, the country faces a severe humanitarian crisis and systematic human rights violations, particularly the suppression of women and girls from public life.</p>

          <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration aims to exempt commercial space launches from most environmental reviews, a move seen as beneficial to companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. Environmental law experts, however, argue that the order's central components may be illegal, as it attempts to bypass federal laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa). Critics warn that without proper oversight, the increasing number of rocket launches could lead to significant pollution of air and water, habitat destruction, and harm to endangered species near launch sites.</p>

          <p>Recent border clashes with Cambodia have significantly strengthened the Thai military's political influence at the expense of the civilian government. The conflict has given the army more autonomy, particularly in border regions, while domestic politics have fallen into disarray. A leaked phone call in which the prime minister appeared to criticize her own army has led to accusations of treason and her suspension from office. Analysts suggest this power shift, combined with a surge in public nationalism, could make the return of a former junta leader more plausible and keeps the possibility of another military coup on the table.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force, citing a city overrun by crime, contrasts with federal data showing a significant drop in violent crime to a three-decade low. While D.C. experienced a crime spike in 2023, that trend has since reversed, yet public perception remains that crime is a serious, rising problem. This article explores the disconnect between statistical reality and public feeling, noting that such perceptions are often influenced by partisan divides and personal experiences. Analysts caution that policy decisions should be data-driven, while also acknowledging the need to address public feelings of safety.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started suspending flights after the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants issued a 72-hour strike notice. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) initiated the notice after contract negotiations stalled, citing the airline's refusal to address key issues like wages and unpaid work. The potential strike, set to begin Saturday, could disrupt travel for 130,000 customers daily during the peak summer season. The Canadian government has urged both parties to return to the bargaining table to avoid a full-scale work stoppage.</p>

          <p>This opinion article condemns the city of Los Angeles for its failure to improve street safety, highlighting the recent death of a nine-year-old boy in a Koreatown traffic incident. The author notes the tragic irony that the city had secured federal funding to install a roundabout and other safety features at the exact intersection where the boy was killed fourteen years ago, but has yet to break ground. The piece argues that bureaucratic delays and underfunding of the city's Vision Zero initiative have led to a preventable public health crisis, with traffic fatalities worsening despite stated goals to eliminate them.</p>

          <p>Major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's are reporting a decline in breakfast sales, which they attribute to the financial pressures facing low-income consumers. As economic uncertainty grows, many people are cutting back on discretionary spending, and a morning drive-thru purchase is often the first to be eliminated. This trend reflects broader economic anxieties, including the impact of tariffs and a weakening labor market, which are reducing the real income of a core demographic for the quick-service restaurant industry. The slowdown marks a shift after nearly a decade of growth in the breakfast market. (not investment advice)</p>

The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, a significant step beyond previous methods that only screened existing chemicals. While these compounds require years of further refinement and clinical trials before they can be used in humans, the breakthrough suggests that AI could usher in a new era of antibiotic discovery to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

However, the data also reveals a growing regional gap in England, with students in London achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East. Despite a smaller A-level cohort, a record number of 18-year-olds secured their first-choice university place, particularly at more selective institutions.
