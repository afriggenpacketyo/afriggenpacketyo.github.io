          <p>Pony.ai, a Chinese robotaxi company, is collaborating with Uber to introduce driverless taxis in the Middle East, marking a significant expansion into new international markets. The initial deployment will feature Pony.ai's robotaxis on Uber's platform in a key Middle Eastern market, with plans to expand further internationally. During the pilot phase, a safety operator will be present in the vehicles until full autonomous commercial service commences. This partnership is vital for Pony.ai's global strategy and enables Uber to integrate autonomous vehicles more efficiently, seeking growth in emerging markets.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan declared that she will challenge the UK Labour government if its decisions harm Welsh communities, emphasizing that her priority is the nation and people of Wales over party loyalty. She cited the need to rethink cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, and advocated for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenue via the Crown Estate. Morgan stressed that this approach is not a split but a form of "grown-up modern government," and will not hesitate to challenge from within, even if it means shaking things up. She also attacked Reform UK and Plaid Cymru, accusing them of focusing on slogans rather than solutions.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's abrupt departure from a US visit, citing illness, and the uncertainty surrounding a planned trip to Moscow have exposed a crisis in Serbia's foreign policy strategy. The visit to the US involved attending a Republican National Committee meeting and a donor dinner hosted by Donald Trump, bypassing standard diplomatic protocols. EU officials have warned that a visit to Moscow to attend the Victory Day Parade could jeopardize Serbia's EU membership aspirations, creating a dilemma for Vucic who is keen to maintain relationships with both the West and Russia. Analysts suggest that Vucic's foreign policy decisions are increasingly driven by the need to repair his political image.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New trade data indicates that US exports are declining across most ports due to Trump's trade tariffs, with the agricultural sector being particularly affected. Ports such as Oregon and Tacoma have experienced significant decreases in exports, especially for products like soybeans and corn. This decline is linked to a decrease in containerships coming to the US as businesses cancel manufacturing orders, as well as changes in global demand due to US trade policy. Retailers are warning consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as data suggests that retail inventories may become lean in the coming months due to supply disruptions.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Ravens are facing backlash for their statement regarding the release of All-Pro kicker Justin Tucker, who is accused of multiple sexual misconduct allegations. The team's executive vice president, Eric DeCosta, praised Tucker's contributions to the team, which some critics found inappropriate given the serious nature of the accusations. Sixteen massage therapists have accused Tucker of inappropriate behavior during sessions between 2012 and 2016, allegations which Tucker has denied. The controversy highlights the challenges sports teams face when addressing serious allegations against prominent players.</p>

          <p>The US Air Force has begun ground tests of new AI-driven combat drones, intensifying its technological competition with China in the development of unmanned weapons systems. The YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A drones, developed by General Atomics and Anduril respectively, are the first unmanned aircraft in US military history to receive fighter designations. The program reflects a strategic shift towards autonomous aerial warfare, with the drones designed to fly alongside crewed fighter jets. These tests are considered a significant milestone, bridging the gap between design and flight and laying the groundwork for fielding the technology to warfighters.</p>

          <p>Daniel Kehlmann's novel, "The Director," explores the moral compromises made by Austrian filmmaker G. W. Pabst, who returned to Nazi Germany to direct films under Joseph Goebbels's supervision. The book delves into the gray areas between victim and perpetrator, questioning how far one can go in compromising their morals for the sake of art. Kehlmann draws on his father's experiences living under the Nazis to depict the rationalizations and self-deceptions that lead to complicity. The novel examines Pabst's choices through the lens of expressionist cinema, highlighting the swift flicker between right and wrong.</p>

Musk's ability to control this service gives him unprecedented geopolitical leverage, as seen in his interactions with the Pentagon regarding Starlink's use in Ukraine.

          <p>A declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua criminal gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang to operate, the Maduro regime does not cooperate with or direct the gang's movement into the United States. This revelation undercuts the Trump administration's rationale for using the wartime statute and raises questions about the Justice Department's investigation into media coverage that challenged the administration's claims.

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting, faces low public trust and a failure to secure a majority in his first attempt to become chancellor, reflecting broader issues with the CDU/CSU and SPD coalition. Merz's trustworthiness has declined due to U-turns on key policies, including working with the AfD and agreeing to debt brake reforms. He also faces criticism for his perceived misogyny and unpopularity in eastern Germany. Merz's strategy of straight-talking leadership has not improved his popularity or diminished the AfD's support.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in recent local elections. He admitted that voters were unhappy with the decision, despite the government's claim that it would free up investment in public services. The policy change, which affected around 9 million pensioners, has been criticized by former cabinet minister Louise Haigh as a "totemic" issue for voters. While Streeting defended the move as part of a broader economic strategy, he conceded that the party had "got the message loud and clear" from voters.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a significant increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but cautioned that US tariffs on EU cars could negatively affect earnings this year.

Ferrari warned that the introduction of US tariffs could reduce profitability by 50 basis points. The automaker said it would raise prices by 10% on certain models in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge, driven by exporters converting US dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their US dollar debt. The currency weakened over 3% against the US dollar on Tuesday, following a 9% rally over the previous two trading days. Experts suggest that the central bank's "notable absence" has fueled speculation that authorities are tolerating a stronger currency to gain trade concessions from the US.

          <p>Three years into Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, antiwar parents and teachers are going to great lengths to shield children from state-mandated patriotic education classes. Some schools are preparing fake schedules to conceal their efforts to shun patriotic education classes, while other parents school their children at home. These efforts are in response to the Kremlinâ€™s drive to indoctrinate children with misinformation about the war, leading to a battle for the minds of the younger generation.
