          <p>Shakeil Thibou, 20, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 29 years for the murder of Cher Maximen at the Notting Hill Carnival. Ms. Maximen, 32, was stabbed with a zombie knife during a fight and died six days later. Judge Philip Katz condemned Thibou's brazen attack in broad daylight, highlighting the devastating impact on Ms. Maximen's young daughter who witnessed the murder. Thibou was also found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon, while his brothers received sentences for violent disorder and assault.</p>

          <p>China and Russia are collaborating to construct a nuclear power station on the moon by 2035, which will power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). This project, seen as a rival to NASA's Artemis Program, aims to establish a permanent lunar base for long-term exploration and scientific research. The ILRS will be located near the lunar south pole and involve numerous international partners, with China inviting many countries and researchers to participate in its "555 Project."

          <p>The Trump administration is facing internal divisions over agreements to sell advanced AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies and widen the nation's lead in the field, others worry about inadequate protections preventing the technology from benefiting China and the potential for the world's largest data centers to be located in the Middle East instead of the United States. The deals, negotiated by administration officials with ties to venture capital, have sparked debate about whether the U.S. is outsourcing the industry of the future to a region where the Trump family has financial interests.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. The debate has sparked clashes among MPs regarding the role of doctors and safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals. Concerns have been raised about potential pressure on individuals to end their lives and the exclusion of medical staff from initiating the discussion about assisted dying with patients. The bill has undergone scrutiny and amendments, with a vote expected to take place in June.</p>

          <p>South Korean shipbuilders might anticipate increased orders due to trade tensions between the US and China, which are causing disruptions in the global shipbuilding sector. However, experts suggest that competition from China will remain fierce. The United States is set to impose higher docking fees on vessels manufactured in China, which could lead to some Chinese shipbuilders losing orders to their Korean competitors. Despite these challenges, China remains a dominant force in the shipbuilding industry.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the anxiety many people, especially women, experience when inviting friends over due to the pressure to have a perfectly clean home. Experts suggest the only rule to follow is to ensure the house is tidy enough for guests to relax, focusing on the comfort of the gathering space rather than striving for perfection. The piece also addresses the tendency to compare homes to idealized images on social media and the importance of suspending judgment about others' living spaces. The key takeaway is to prioritize spending quality time with friends over maintaining an immaculate house.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime sceneâ€”bloody, bare footprintsâ€”eventually led to the conviction of Jerry Westrom for the murder of Jeanie Childs. The article details how investigators initially cleared Childs' roommate based on an alibi and footprint analysis. Decades later, DNA evidence from the crime scene was linked to Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Ultimately, forensic analysis confirmed that the bloody footprints at the scene matched Westrom, leading to his arrest and conviction despite his denial of knowing the victim.</p>

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has urged commuters to work from home and is considering all options, including a state of emergency.

          <p>New Jersey Transit train engineers have initiated a strike, disrupting the commutes of hundreds of thousands of people in New Jersey and New York. The strike, which began after unsuccessful negotiations between the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and NJ Transit, has halted all NJ Transit commuter trains and the MTA Metro-North West of Hudson service. Commuters are encouraged to work from home, and NJ Transit has announced a contingency plan with limited bus service, but the strike is expected to cause significant transportation challenges.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has made new commitments to the European Union to address concerns about competition by unbundling its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams workplace communication app. Microsoft will offer versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 without Teams at a reduced price and allow customers to switch to the tools without Teams. These concessions are aimed at avoiding a potential antitrust fine from the European Commission, which has been investigating the tying of Teams to Microsoft's productivity tools.</p>

          <p>According to German police figures, irregular migration to Germany has significantly decreased in the past two years. Germany's new interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has implemented increased border checks, instructing police to turn back asylum-seekers, with exceptions for vulnerable individuals. While the measures have been welcomed by some, critics question their legality and effectiveness. The AfD believes the measures don't go far enough, while the Green Party warns of the effects on police officers and potential legal consequences.</p>

The piece also connects the trope to broader cultural anxieties about gender roles and financial dependence, particularly in the context of the tradwife movement and conservative political ideologies.</p>
