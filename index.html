        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 children, a new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" focuses on creating a secure environment where children feel understood and accepted. This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing for parents, teaching them to manage their children's behaviors by building emotional resilience, trust, and connection. Emotionally safe parents accept their children's emotions without judgment, view misbehavior as stress signals, and take responsibility for conflicts by apologizing and reconnecting. The core of this parenting style is open and honest communication, ensuring children feel safe expressing their emotions and being their authentic selves.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, communities commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, which sparked widespread protests against racism and police brutality. Floyd's family gathered in Houston, while Minneapolis hosted several events, including a church service and candlelight vigil. Despite initial hopes for lasting change, some observers note that the national "reckoning" with racism seems to be fading. Rev. Al Sharpton emphasized that while the conviction of Derek Chauvin was a step towards justice, the work is far from over, underscoring the need for continued efforts to address systemic racism.</p>

          <p>Top Republicans in the US Senate are threatening to block President Trump's spending bill if it fails to address the growing national debt. Senator Ron Johnson warned that his faction has enough votes to halt the bill until Trump commits to spending cuts and deficit reduction. The bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts in exchange for benefits cuts, faces a tough path through the Senate due to concerns about its impact on the deficit and healthcare access. Senator Rand Paul criticized the spending cuts as insufficient, further complicating the bill's prospects.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region.
