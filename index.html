        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six Nobel laureate economists have criticized a budget bill passed by the House, arguing that it would significantly increase the U.S. debt and exacerbate inequality. The economists, writing on behalf of the Economic Policy Institute, contend that the bill would weaken safety-net programs like Medicaid and food stamps while disproportionately benefiting higher-income households through tax cuts. They estimate that the bill would add over $3 trillion to the public debt, potentially leading to upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The economists are concerned that the proposed tax cuts, combined with cuts to social safety nets, would result in a large upward redistribution of income, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor. The Senate is expected to consider the bill amid opposition from Democrats and concerns from some Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Marshall, a former Minnesota Vikings defensive end and member of the "Purple People Eaters," has died at the age of 87 after a period of hospitalization. Marshall played for 20 years in the NFL, primarily with the Vikings, and was known for his toughness and leadership. He set an NFL record for position players by playing 282 consecutive regular-season games and also holds the record for career fumble recoveries. Marshall was a key member of the Vikings' four Super Bowl appearances and won an NFL championship in 1969, leaving a lasting impact on the team and the sport. His contributions to the Vikings were significant both on and off the field, making him a respected figure in NFL history. The team mourns the loss of a tremendous player and person. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposed rule would suspend the issuance of new work permits until U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe that would be difficult to meet given existing backlogs. Even if the 180-day processing average is achieved, asylum-seekers would be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of the current six months. Advocates are concerned that this change could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, potentially driving them to work illegally. The proposed rule seeks to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has introduced the Strong Borders Act, a bill aimed at restricting asylum claims and enhancing authorities' powers to halt immigration application processing. Immigration Minister Lena Diab stated the bill intends to combat organized crime, illegal drug and weapon flows, and to bolster the "integrity" of Canada's immigration system. Key provisions include increased police border monitoring powers and barring asylum claims from individuals in Canada for over a year. Critics argue the bill, granting authorities broader mail inspection powers, infringes upon civil liberties, while the government aims to address increasing pressure to curb immigration amid strained public services and a housing crisis. The legislation also introduces restrictions on cash transactions exceeding C$10,000.</p>

Zhongman used air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers and prevent well collapse, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This partnership reflects a strategic alignment, with Chinese companies seeking overseas opportunities and Middle Eastern countries looking to Chinese expertise for development challenges.

The government had previously ended their humanitarian parole and ordered them to self-deport, prompting warnings from Sofia's doctors that she would likely die if forced to return to Mexico. The reversal came after significant pressure from Democratic lawmakers and public outrage, with the administration granting the family humanitarian parole for one year.

Under Senate Bill 243, operators of companion chatbot platforms would be required to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters aren’t human. Platforms would also need to implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation, suicide, or self-harm expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources.

          <p>A New Mexico appeals court has rejected a lawsuit alleging that the state failed to meet constitutional provisions for protecting against oil and gas industry pollution. The court found that it was beyond the judiciary's authority to weigh whether pollution controls are adequate, deferring to the Legislature. The 2023 lawsuit from environmental groups invoked the constitution’s pollution-control clause, requiring New Mexico to prevent contamination of natural resources. The court noted the state's long history of permitting oil and gas extraction and that resource extraction must coexist with pollution control legislation. Environmental advocates have vowed to appeal the matter to the state's top court.</p>

          <p>At least 27 Palestinians were fatally shot and 161 others wounded while attempting to reach a food distribution center in Gaza run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reported this as the third day of deadly violence near the GHF hub, which the UN has accused of weaponizing aid. The Israeli military stated its troops fired warning shots near the aid hub, and that it was aware of reports of casualties and was investigating them. Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, demanded a prompt and impartial investigation, calling the situation in Gaza "unconscionable". The GHF claims it has distributed over 7 million meals since operations began about a week ago.</p>

It accuses Musk of violating "norms at an astonishing pace," calling his actions "scandalous behavior." Musk's time leading DOGE was marked by unprecedented upheaval to the federal workforce and government agencies.

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official has resigned from her role overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. This follows an order from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance. Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos stated she could no longer help the most vulnerable members of the population in her role. The resignation highlights concerns over political interference in public health recommendations, particularly regarding the exclusion of pregnant women from COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. The process to update the CDC's influential vaccine recommendations is closely watched by experts because they are tied to federal policies and programs.</p>

          <p>Pornhub is blocking access to its adult content in France to protest new regulations requiring porn sites to verify users are 18 or older. The parent company, Aylo, will display a statement on France's new regulations instead of pornographic content. The new standard requires explicit websites to verify a user's age using a credit card or government-issued ID document. Aylo argues that age verification should be done on devices rather than websites, calling the French government's measure potentially privacy-infringing and ineffective. France's digital and audiovisual communication regulator Arcom estimates that 2.3 million minors access porn websites every month in the country.</p>

Musk, who recently left the administration, stated that the bill will massively increase the budget deficit and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. The legislation includes tax breaks, increased defense spending, and a rise in the debt ceiling. Musk's comments reflect wider tensions within the Republican Party over the bill, which faces opposition from different factions. Despite Musk's criticism, Republican lawmakers plan to proceed with the bill, while some Democrats have welcomed Musk's comments.</p>
