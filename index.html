          <p>A protest in Epping, Essex, at a hotel used for housing asylum seekers escalated into disorder, with attendees throwing bottles and flares at police vehicles. The unrest, which led to one arrest, followed the recent charge of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assaults in the town. In response to previous clashes that injured eight officers, Essex Police implemented a special order requiring the removal of face coverings. Authorities have stated they will act robustly against any criminal behavior while respecting the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is pressuring the Washington Commanders to revert to their previous name, the Redskins, which was changed in 2020 due to its perception as a slur. He has threatened to block a deal for the team to build a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site in Washington, D.C., if the name is not changed back. The land for the proposed stadium is federally controlled, complicating the redevelopment plans. Trump also urged the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to return to their former name, the Indians.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons clarified his agency's broad enforcement mandate, stating that any individual encountered who is in the U.S. without authorization will be arrested, regardless of criminal history. While the agency prioritizes serious offenders, Lyons noted that so-called "collateral" arrests of non-criminals have increased due to a lack of cooperation from sanctuary jurisdictions. He also announced a renewed crackdown on companies that knowingly employ unauthorized workers.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has declared he will not resign, despite exit polls indicating his ruling coalition will lose its majority in the country's upper house of parliament. The projected defeat reflects significant voter frustration with rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals that have damaged the Liberal Democratic Party. This loss of control in the upper house is expected to significantly undermine the coalition's ability to govern effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group have signed a new peace declaration, mediated by Qatar, aimed at ending their long-running conflict. The agreement calls for a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations to restore state authority in rebel-held territories.
