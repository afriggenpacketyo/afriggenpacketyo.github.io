          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in its second-quarter revenues, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The company's adjusted net income was $24.5 billion, slightly above analyst forecasts. Despite the current price depression influenced by uncertain global demand and U.S. tariffs, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, anticipating a significant rise in oil demand in the latter half of 2025. The company has also adjusted its dividend policy for 2025 following a first-quarter profit decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, in what may be the first case involving a prisoner with a working implantable defibrillator. His attorneys have argued the device could cause unnecessary pain during the lethal injection, but courts have allowed the execution to proceed. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. The case has raised ethical questions for medical professionals and highlights ongoing debates about capital punishment methods.</p>

Key advice includes planning transfers in blocks of fixtures, balancing premium players, and quickly rectifying mistakes.

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis of England's cricket team suggests its success is critically dependent on captain Ben Stokes. The article highlights that without Stokes, the team appears vulnerable and lacks balance. As England prepares for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia, a country where they have not won a Test in over a decade, Stokes's fitness and performance are seen as paramount. The challenge is immense, given the inexperience of many English players on Australian soil and the strength of Australia's bowling attack.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has placed former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup after his 2022 election defeat. The decision, issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated previous precautionary measures by addressing supporters via his son's phone during a protest. The case has drawn international attention, with the Trump administration condemning the court's order and tying it to potential U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods. Bolsonaro's lawyers have stated they will appeal the house arrest ruling.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that Poland is experiencing a resurgence of right-wing populism less than two years after Donald Tusk's liberal coalition ousted the Law and Justice party. Despite initial optimism, Tusk's government is struggling, with his presidential candidate losing and his own popularity plummeting. The article suggests that by adopting some of his predecessors' rhetoric and failing to present a compelling future vision, Tusk is losing ground. This situation serves as a cautionary tale for other democracies, showing that simply removing populists from power is not enough to secure liberal democracy.</p>

The White House stated that the task force will coordinate security, transportation, and visa processing for the global event. The move was praised by the LA28 organizing committee, which thanked the Trump administration for its leadership and support. This follows a similar task force chaired by Trump for the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, has announced significant changes to its labor practices after a large-scale ICE raid on its facilities last month. The raid resulted in one worker's death and the detention of over 360 people. The company has terminated its relationship with the labor contractors involved and hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to improve its employment eligibility verification. Glass House stated these changes are intended to prevent a similar incident from ever happening again as it grapples with the raid's aftermath.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal worth approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement marks the largest-ever defense industry deal between the two nations and Japan's first major warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation vessel as the best choice for Australia's capability needs. This purchase is part of Australia's significant military restructuring aimed at enhancing its naval fleet and long-range strike capabilities in response to China's regional military expansion.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by 45 California counties over improper disposal of hazardous waste. The lawsuit alleged that UPS facilities disposed of corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Prosecutors noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently mating season for tarantulas in California, a period when the typically reclusive male spiders emerge from their burrows in search of a mate. This seasonal behavior, lasting from August to December, makes sightings more common in areas like Joshua Tree National Park and the Santa Monica Mountains. Experts note that while their appearance may be intimidating, native tarantulas are shy, slow-moving, and pose no serious threat to humans unless provoked. Their bites are not deadly, and their primary defense is flicking irritant hairs from their bodies.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force many communities to switch to expensive, taxpayer-funded paid departments. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews and save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. However, their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and prevent the collapse of this vital community safety net.</p>

In a social media post, Trump endorsed the ad as the "HOTTEST" out there and celebrated Sweeney as a registered Republican, contrasting it with what he called "woke" advertising failures.

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that in the event of a military blockade by China, Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just under two weeks.

However, the report concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its tracing process, which can be difficult for people who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records. NS&I states that the unclaimed amount represents a very small fraction of the total prizes awarded since 1957 and that it provides multiple ways for people to check for and trace winnings.</p>
