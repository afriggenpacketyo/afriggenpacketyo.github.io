          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, citing technological issues and staffing shortages as key problems. Duffy announced plans to meet with airline leaders to scale back Newark flights and proposed a multibillion-dollar investment to modernize the air traffic control system. He acknowledged that similar issues could arise at other U.S. airports due to outdated systems, but maintained that air travel remains safe. The Trump administration has cut probationary workers from the F.A.A. in recent months, largely as a result of Elon Musk’s large-scale reductions at federal agencies.</p>

          <h2>India and Pakistan Claim Victory After Cease-Fire</h2>

          <p>After some initial skirmishing, India and Pakistan turned on Sunday to making the case that they had come out on top in the four-day conflict. President Trump announced on Saturday that the two sides had agreed to a cease-fire with the help of U.S. mediation. India made no reference to an American role, presumably in part because it hoped to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped its fight against its neighbor and archenemy under outside pressure. Some Indian officials said that India’s actions in the conflict illustrated the tougher stance the country had taken on terrorism under Mr. Modi.</p>

          <p>The stock market's upcoming week will be heavily influenced by inflation reports and potential developments in trade negotiations. The consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) releases will be closely monitored for indications of inflationary pressures stemming from Trump's tariffs. Other economic data, including retail sales and consumer sentiment, will provide further insights into the economic outlook. Several companies outside the portfolio will report earnings, offering insights into AI spending, consumer behavior, and the impact of the U.S.-China trade war.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says that the US and China have made "substantial progress" on de-escalating the trade war as high-level talks wrapped in Geneva, Switzerland. Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng have been engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January. The treasury secretary did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine responded cautiously on Sunday to Russia’s offer of direct talks, calling it a “positive sign” but insisting that President Vladimir V. Putin must agree to an immediate cease-fire first. Mr. Zelensky did not directly address those details, but said in a social media post that he still “expected Russia to confirm a cease-fire” that would start on Monday. The leaders of France, Britain, Germany and Poland visited Ukraine over the weekend and set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry’s desperate plea to reconcile with his father highlighted a rupture that could undermine the monarchy’s attempts to model unity. King Charles III was busy last week marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany and preparing to fly to Canada to open its Parliament later this month. Harry’s emotional plea to be reconciled with his family — made in a recent interview with the BBC, in which he mused about how long his cancer-stricken father had left to live — resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, which has yet to find its footing in the still-fledgling Carolean era.</p>

          <p>The White House announced on Sunday that a trade deal with China has been struck after two days of talks in Geneva. The announcement, in a press release, comes after US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that there had been “substantial progress” in talks between his team and that of the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Geneva on defusing the trade war between the world’s two largest economies sparked by Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs. In remarks that were posted on social media by the White House, Bessent said he would give more details on Monday, “but I can tell you that the talks were productive”.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that the United States and China have reached a trade deal following negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated the agreement addresses national security concerns related to trade imbalances. While details are scarce, officials from both sides have expressed optimism about de-escalating the trade war and normalizing relations, though Trump's rhetoric about opening China to US business has raised eyebrows. Trump has emphasized the need for China to open up to American business, seemingly ignoring the existing trade relations between the two nations.</p>

US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as "difficult but useful". The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.</p>

One cafe owner in Kabul, who has hosted informal chess competitions in recent years, said he would respect the decision but it would hurt his business.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar’s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism. Assuming Trump accepts the plane as planned, the jumbo jet would first be transferred to the US air force so the military branch could configure the aircraft to meet the specifications required for presidential travel, ABC’s sources told the network. According to ABC’s sources, Trump’s attorney general Pam Bondi and his top White House lawyer David Warrington have pre-emptively concluded that it is “legally permissible” for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.</p>

He began with a variation on the classic line, of course: “I’d say ‘Happy Mother’s Day,’ but all I see are two young men out with their much-younger sisters.” The sketch went for laughs by implying how ridiculous it was that a guy like him could truly be hot for these silly, frumpy old moms, these “mature goddesses dripping in Talbot’s,” as he called them.</p>

Strict European Union regulations, including a ban on hormones, govern European farming practices. The Trump administration argues that American meat, produced without similar regulations, is better and should be more widely available in Europe. The European Union allocates a big chunk of its budget to supporting farmers, and a mix of tariffs and quotas limit competition in sensitive areas.</p>
