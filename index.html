          <h2>UK Economy Shows Encouraging Growth Despite Lingering Cost of Living Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves reports that the UK economy is showing positive signs, with a 0.7% growth in the first quarter, exceeding forecasts. This growth is attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, though analysts caution that this pace may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. Businesses express mixed reactions, with some absorbing tariffs to maintain stability and others delaying decisions due to economic uncertainty. The Bank of England's recent interest rate cuts add further complexity to the economic outlook, potentially affecting mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Trevor Bauer voiced his frustration on social media following Pete Rose's reinstatement, questioning why he remains excluded from the league. Bauer has been out of MLB for four years due to sexual assault allegations, though he was never charged with a crime and his suspension has ended. He suggests that MLB is preventing teams from signing him, despite the league stating he is eligible to play. Bauer spent the 2023 season playing baseball in Japan.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on limiting judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential policies, specifically in cases challenging President Trump's birthright citizenship policy. The administration argues that district court judges lack the authority to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in litigation. The outcome could significantly impact the executive branch's ability to implement policies and the judiciary's role in checking executive power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to Israel in his second term appears to be a stark contrast to his first, as he prioritizes regional dealmaking over unwavering support for Israel's broader interests. While still rhetorically pro-Israel, Trump has engaged in direct negotiations with Israel's adversaries without coordination, signaling a shift in US foreign policy priorities in the Middle East. This has led to frustration within the Israeli government, as Trump seems less concerned with aligning US and Israeli interests.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has intensified its operation in the Gaza Strip, conducting multiple strikes for the second consecutive night. The government has vowed to push into the Palestinian enclave to destroy Hamas, with dozens reported killed in the latest attacks. The increased strikes come as Israel's government approved plans to expand its military operation in Gaza despite calls for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal construction sites in Gaza, potentially for distribution centers as part of a new Israeli-US aid plan. The plan, however, has been rejected by the UN and faces criticism for potentially cutting off vulnerable populations. UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan, saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles. Construction is happening in the Morag Corridor.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the US and Iran are close to reaching a nuclear deal, suggesting that a military strike on Tehran could be avoided. His comments follow a statement from an advisor to Iran's supreme leader indicating Tehran was willing to make concessions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018.</p>

          <h2>Report: Yacht Crew Unaware of Wind Speed Risks Prior to Fatal Sinking</h2>

          <p>An interim report indicates that the crew of the Bayesian, a luxury superyacht that sank off Sicily, were unaware that wind speeds exceeding 73mph could cause it to capsize. Modeling suggests gusts of this speed, combined with the sails being down and the centreboard up, would likely lead to the yacht's capsize. The MAIB report details the events leading up to the sinking, which resulted in the deaths of seven people, including tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his daughter.</p>
