          <p>A parenting expert and author discusses ways to support fathers, particularly those facing challenges such as divorce or mental health issues. The article highlights the importance of acknowledging fathers' efforts and offering support rather than judgment, emphasizing that no father dreams of being away from their child. It suggests that parenting is a team sport and that fathers benefit from supportive communities and understanding. The article also touches on the impact of parental separation on children and encourages reframing negative self-perceptions. The author advocates for compassion and rewriting the narrative surrounding fathers, reminding them that their roles matter and they are not alone.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and prompting a state of emergency declaration. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that a missile and drone attack against Israel was expected in the immediate future, leading to air raid sirens sounding in Tel Aviv. Former President Trump described the attack as "excellent" and hinted at further actions to come.

          <p>Seven men in Rochdale have been found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period. The victims were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves," enduring repeated sexual assaults. The girls, who had troubled home lives, were plied with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes by the men, who worked as taxi drivers or on the local market. One of the victims stated that police and social workers were aware of the situation but did not intervene sufficiently.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a lower court's order that would have required President Trump to return control of 4,000 federalized California National Guard troops to Governor Newsom. Judge Breyer had ruled Trump's action illegal, stating that none of the conditions required for federalization existed, such as an invasion or rebellion. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to consider arguments on extending the stay or allowing Breyer's ruling to take effect. Trump reacted by saying he could use the National Guard to keep cities safe, while Newsom criticized Trump's actions as authoritarian.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily halted a judge's ruling that blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The court will take more time to consider the administration's request for relief while it appeals the lower court's decision. Judge Breyer had found that California officials were likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles. The Trump administration argued that there is no "rioters' veto" to the enforcement of federal law and that the president has the right to call forth the National Guard.</p>

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in western India, killing all but one of the 242 people on board, marking the first crash of this aircraft model.

Investigators will be examining the black boxes, maintenance records, pilot actions, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. The Dreamliner had been in service since 2014, and while there have been past manufacturing concerns, no immediate connection to this crash is apparent.</p>

Abrego Garcia's lawyers have accused the Trump administration of abusing its power in the process of returning him to the U.S. after he was initially deported due to an administrative error. Federal prosecutors have asked a federal judge to detain Abrego Garcia as his court proceedings play out, arguing that he poses a danger to the community and is a serious flight risk.</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists have issued an open letter warning of the resurgence of fascism and urging resistance to it. They draw parallels to 1925, when Italian intellectuals denounced Mussolini's regime, emphasizing the importance of defending democratic institutions and human rights. The letter highlights the undermining of the separation of powers, silencing of opposition, and attacks on cultural and scientific institutions as hallmarks of fascism. It calls for collective action, upholding facts and evidence, and fostering critical thinking to combat authoritarianism. The signatories stress the need for international cooperation and the protection of universal human rights.</p>

          <p>Despite rising tensions with Israel, analysts believe it is unlikely that Iran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait could trigger further retaliation and draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Experts suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows is unlikely and might even be physically impossible. The presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain makes it difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun sending termination notices to approximately 500,000 foreign nationals who had received temporary stays under the CHNV program. Recipients are encouraged to "self-deport immediately" using DHS's Home Mobile App, with the promise of travel assistance and a $1,000 bonus upon arrival in their home country. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling that DHS can order CHNV participants to leave the country, even as they challenge Trump's revocation of the program. The CHNV program provided temporary stays for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela due to conflicts or unsafe conditions in their home countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed planned protests against authoritarianism, stating he doesn’t “feel like a king” and faces challenges in getting approvals. Organizers of the “No Kings” protests plan a nationwide day of defiance, emphasizing that the flag belongs to the people, not Trump. The protests coincide with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which has sparked demonstrations in Los Angeles and other cities. Trump warned that any protests would be met with “very big force,” while the planned military parade is estimated to cost taxpayers about $45 million.</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular perk, are becoming less common as more companies adopt hybrid work schedules. While employees value summer Fridays as a way to prevent burnout and boost morale, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits. Experts suggest that the shift towards work-from-home Fridays has contributed to the decline of summer Fridays. The perk "can go a long way in showing employees they're valued, which can help prevent burnout, boost morale, and improve retention during a season when disengagement can run high."</p>

          <p>President Trump's planned military parade in Washington, D.C., is being criticized as an un-American display of power and self-aggrandizement. The parade, scheduled for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and Trump's birthday, is seen as a contrast to George Washington's resistance to military displays. Washington favored a parade that honored artisans and tradespeople, representing the values of a constitutional republic based on the will of the people. Critics argue that Trump's parade is reminiscent of authoritarian regimes and a warning sign for those concerned about basic rights.</p>

          <p>The traditional “religious right” is evolving into a new movement driven more by political ideology than theological principles, as described in this article. The author argues that this new religious right, aligned with the MAGA movement, prioritizes American nationalism over traditional religious values. The new movement seeks to reshape America in unprecedented ways and that this new movement is far more complex. Unlike its predecessors, this movement is less concerned with the afterlife and more focused on reshaping society in the present. The author suggests that progressives may find unexpected allies among traditional conservative believers who are alarmed by the radical vision of the MAGA movement.</p>
