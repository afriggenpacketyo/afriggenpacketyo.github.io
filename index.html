          <p>Former President Donald Trump delivered a speech to the Israeli Knesset, heralding a "historic dawn of a new Middle East" following a ceasefire agreement he helped broker. The deal led to the release of the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas, an event met with celebration in Israel. Trump received a warm reception, with many attendees wearing hats celebrating him as a peace president, and he later attended a peace summit in Egypt with other world leaders.</p>

          <p>A commentary in China's PLA Daily has emphasized the urgent need for the military to achieve "deep integration" of its equipment, personnel, and operational systems to overcome current shortcomings. The article argues that modern warfare is a "contest between systems" and that failing to advance beyond mechanized-era thinking could lead to significant disadvantages against formidable adversaries. This highlights Beijing's focus on enhancing coordinated, multi-branch combat capabilities amid rapid technological and military revolutions globally.</p>

          <p>A massive class-action lawsuit has commenced at the High Court against five major car manufacturers—Mercedes, Ford, Peugeot/Citroën, and Renault/Nissan—over the "dieselgate" scandal. The companies are accused of using illegal "defeat devices" in their diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, misleading consumers about their environmental performance. The case, described as the largest in English and Welsh legal history, could eventually involve 1.6 million car owners seeking compensation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine to bolster its capabilities against Russia. This potential move follows requests from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for stronger military support and has drawn sharp warnings from Moscow, which views it as a major escalation that could dramatically strain US-Russian relations. The missiles' 2,500 km range would put Russian cities, including Moscow, within Ukraine's reach for the first time.</p>

The controversy has been amplified by a New York City mayoral candidate's anti-Columbus stance, leading to efforts to designate the statues as historical landmarks for protection. The article provides context, noting that Columbus Day was established in 1892 partly as a response to the mass lynching of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans.</p>

          <p>In an interview, political scientist Barbara Walter argues that the current U.S. political environment is in a "high-risk zone" for sustained instability. She identifies key differences from past periods of violence, including how political leaders now weaponize tragedies instead of unifying the country, the rise of reciprocal violence from both the left and right, and the dangerous politicization of law enforcement agencies. Walter warns that these factors create a self-sustaining cycle of conflict that erodes democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The families of two hostages, Bipin Joshi and Tamir Nimrodi, are facing renewed anguish after the men were not included on the list of 20 living hostages released by Hamas on Monday. Prior to the exchange, the fate of these two individuals had been unknown, with hopes they were still alive. Their absence from the final release list, without any official confirmation of their status from either Israel or Hamas, leaves their loved ones in a painful state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>South Africa is at the center of a significant legal battle over the decriminalization of sex work, with a crucial high court trial scheduled for May 2026. Proponents, including the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), argue that criminalization violates constitutional rights and makes workers vulnerable to violence and health risks. Opponents, however, contend that sex work is inherently exploitative and that decriminalization would promote human trafficking and public nuisance.</p>

          <p>The United States has called for the immediate release of 30 leaders of Zion Church, one of China's largest underground Christian networks, who were detained in coordinated raids across several cities. This crackdown is being described by Christian groups as the most extensive persecution against the faith in China in decades. The arrests highlight the intensifying pressure on religious groups that operate outside the control of the state-sanctioned churches governed by the Communist Party.</p>
