          <p>Violent crime rates in the United States, which had spiked during the pandemic, have significantly decreased, returning to pre-pandemic levels and possibly reaching historic lows. The article notes that murder rates have fallen sharply in 2024 and early 2025, with some cities like Baltimore seeing their lowest homicide numbers in over a decade. Factors contributing to this decline include the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and targeted government interventions like community violence interruption programs. Despite these positive trends, many Americans still perceive crime as rising, highlighting a disconnect between perception and reality due to the media's focus on outlier events and the article emphasizes the importance of recognizing actual improvements in order to support effective reforms.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck the Cannes region in France during the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting approximately 160,000 homes. The outage was reportedly caused by a fire at a substation in Tanneron, with police suspecting arson as the cause, though a connection to the film festival is unconfirmed. The festival organizers quickly switched to an alternative power supply, ensuring that the closing ceremony and scheduled events proceeded without significant disruption.

          <p>President Trump is considering ending the federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially taking the mortgage giants public, which has spurred debate among investors and policymakers. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit shareholders but raises concerns about potential disruptions to the housing market and increased mortgage rates. Critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatizing Fannie and Freddie could reward Wall Street at the expense of homebuyers, while supporters argue it could generate significant revenue for taxpayers. The decision, which would unwind 17 years of federal control, remains uncertain, with the Trump administration evaluating the plan's impact on the housing market.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion article accuses broadcast networks of biased coverage of political books, favoring negative "tell-all" books about Trump while downplaying similar books about Biden. The article cites the extensive coverage given to Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" compared to the limited attention paid to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book on Biden. The author argues that networks actively promoted anti-Trump narratives while neglecting or dismissing critical reporting on Biden's failings, highlighting a perceived double standard in media coverage of the two presidents.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article scrutinizes a report cited by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to justify an FDA safety review of mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill. The report, published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is criticized for its flawed methodology, lack of transparency, and biased conclusions. Experts question the report's data sources, criteria for defining adverse events, and failure to account for confounding factors. The article raises concerns that political motivations, rather than scientific evidence, may influence the FDA's review of mifepristone, potentially restricting access to the drug.</p>

The article highlights the tension between Reeves' commitment to fiscal responsibility and the desire among some Labour members for more progressive economic measures to address inequality and support public services.

          <p>President Trump's tax and spending plans, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," are facing increasing skepticism from Wall Street, with concerns rising about the US's "twin deficit" position and the potential for inflation and recession.

Economists warn that Trump's policies could lead to unsustainable debt levels and erode investor confidence in the US economy, potentially triggering a broader global economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>A global survey reveals that UK workers are working from home more than most of their international counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week remotely. This trend, which has stabilized since 2023, is attributed to factors like commuting costs and a shift in work culture. While younger employees show a preference for office work, women and parents are more likely to resist strict return-to-office mandates. The study suggests that hybrid work has become the norm, with no strong evidence of decreased productivity, though fully remote roles may face pressure from automation and AI.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are attempting to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, largely benefiting wealthy Americans and corporations.

Economists suggest that the tax cuts have done little to help the middle class, with corporations primarily using their savings for stock buybacks. The bill's provisions, including stricter work requirements for Medicaid and Snap, are expected to disproportionately harm working-class families.</p>
