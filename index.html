          <h2>Trump Threatens Additional 10% Tariff on Countries Aligned with BRICS Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:25:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat was made via a post on his Truth Social platform as the BRICS summit convened in Brazil. This move escalates trade tensions, following the bloc's joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures and indiscriminate tariffs. The BRICS group, which recently expanded, aims to increase the influence of Global South countries and challenge Western-dominated economic institutions. Trump also confirmed that letters detailing country-specific tariff rates would be sent out, with new rates potentially taking effect on August 1st for nations without a U.S. agreement.

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party, the "American Party." Trump described Musk as going "completely off the rails" and called the creation of a third party a source of "disruption and chaos." The move signals a significant falling out between the two, who were previously allies, with Musk having led a government efficiency task force. The dispute escalated over disagreements on a federal spending bill and the termination of electric vehicle tax credits, a policy Trump had long signaled he would implement. Musk's announcement has also drawn criticism from some business figures, citing potential conflicts with his CEO responsibilities.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Chantal Weakens After Making Landfall, Causing Flash Floods in the Carolinas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:17:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rainfall and significant flash flooding concerns across the Carolinas and Virginia. The system is expected to drop up to six inches of rain in some areas, leading to flood watches and dangerous conditions. In North Carolina's Chatham County, over 100 roads were reported flooded, and a portion of a highway collapsed. The Haw River surged to near-record levels, prompting emergency officials to conduct rescues of stranded motorists and notify residents in flood-prone areas. While the storm is weakening as it moves northeast, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to persist along the Atlantic coast for several days.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has found no evidence of a so-called "client list" of associates involved in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The memo, ordered by Trump-appointed leadership, also states that investigators did not uncover evidence to support charges against any other individuals connected to the case. This conclusion is likely to frustrate those who believed Epstein's high-profile connections would be implicated. The review also released footage that officials say further confirms Epstein's death in custody was a suicide, aiming to counter widespread conspiracy theories. The memo asserts that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the primary goal of bringing justice to victims of child exploitation.</p>

          <p>Globally, women are having fewer children than ever before, a trend driven by increased economic independence and changing personal priorities that is leading to significant societal challenges. This demographic shift, with fertility rates in many countries falling below the population replacement level of 2.1 children per woman, is raising concerns about future labor shortages, economic stagnation, and the solvency of social safety nets like Social Security. While some view the trend positively due to reduced environmental impact and a drop in teen pregnancies, economists and policymakers worry about depopulation in nations like South Korea and China. The debate is intensifying over pronatalist policies, which aim to encourage higher birth rates to mitigate these long-term risks.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, a severe housing crisis is unfolding as large-scale financial institutions increasingly treat residential property as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices and rents beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investment in real estate has skyrocketed, leading to the "financialization" of homes and prioritizing profits over housing needs. This trend exacerbates inequality, fuels political discontent, and contributes to the rise of far-right movements. While investors profit from housing shortages, the article argues that this market-driven approach has failed to provide affordable homes and calls for structural changes to reclaim housing as a public good.

Despite a promising run in the tournament, the loss to a top-ranked opponent continues a worrying trend of inconsistency. Pochettino has struggled to build a cohesive unit, partly due to player availability issues, having used 55 different players in 10 months. While the tournament provided valuable experience for fringe players and showed moments of determination, the result underscores the significant work needed to establish a clear identity and a prepared, first-choice squad for the upcoming global competition.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a recent clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks. The treatment works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers reported considerable hearing improvement in all ten participants, with the most dramatic results seen in younger children. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope that similar treatments could one day address other common genetic causes of deafness, marking a significant step forward in medical science.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. In a statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, the leaders emphasized that fair governance is necessary to prevent AI from widening the digital divide. They advocate for the development of technical standards through a process involving public sector and UN agencies to ensure AI systems are trustworthy, secure, and reliable. The statement also stressed the importance of open-source collaboration, digital sovereignty, and ensuring that developing nations in the Global South have equal access to AI technologies, data, and research capacity, preventing standards from becoming market barriers.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a cherished Christian girls' camp in Texas, became the site of a horrific tragedy when the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, sweeping through low-lying cabins. The flash flood, which has claimed at least 78 lives in the region, killed the camp's director and several young campers, with others still missing. Survivors described terrifying scenes of being evacuated by military trucks as the camp was completely destroyed by the deluge. The camp has been operated by the same family for generations and is a beloved summer destination for families across Texas. The disaster has raised difficult questions about the safety of building camps so close to a river in an area prone to flash floods.</p>

          <p>The latest round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt in Doha, has concluded without any significant progress. The talks are expected to resume as mediators work to bridge the substantial gaps that remain between the two sides' positions. Hamas continues to insist on a guaranteed end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops, conditions Israel has repeatedly rejected. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he is committed to releasing all hostages and eliminating Hamas's capabilities. The diplomatic efforts are occurring amidst ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza, with the civilian death toll continuing to rise, creating a tense backdrop for the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and triggering a massive explosion that destroyed the building. Two occupants of the vehicle were rescued by bystanders just minutes before the structure was engulfed in flames and subsequently exploded. The dramatic blast, captured on video, sent debris flying but caused no additional injuries, as the commercial building was empty at the time of the incident. The crash, which involved two other vehicles, resulted in multiple people being hospitalized. The explosion caused significant damage to the Domino's and adjacent businesses, but fortunately, no firefighters on the scene were harmed by the blast.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire so far this year. Containment has reached 30% for the blaze, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Favorable weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 firefighting personnel have bolstered efforts to control the fire, which started on Wednesday. The fire is burning in a rural area and threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to several endangered species. While evacuation orders remain for over 200 people, officials are optimistic about continued progress before a potential heat wave arrives midweek, which could present new challenges for the containment effort.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired both manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo during their sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Team owner Mark Lerner acknowledged their past success but stated that recent on-field performance has not met expectations, necessitating a "fresh approach and new energy." Rizzo had been with the organization since 2009, building the team that won the franchise's only championship. The firings mark a definitive end of an era for the club as it continues a difficult rebuilding process.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to take paid bereavement leave. Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give people essential time away from work to grieve without worrying about their job. The move, which has been campaigned for by MPs and charities, is being hailed as a hugely important step in acknowledging the significant emotional impact of pregnancy loss for both parents, regardless of when it occurs during the gestation period.</p>

          <p>The UK government will offer qualified early years teachers tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract and retain them in nurseries located in disadvantaged areas. This initiative is part of a broader £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at boosting educational standards and narrowing the attainment gap among preschool children. Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. The plan, announced by the education department, seeks to address this disparity by incentivizing skilled professionals to work where the need is greatest. The strategy also includes proposals for more frequent Ofsted inspections of nurseries to ensure high standards of care and education.</p>
