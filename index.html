          <p>An international operation involving multiple countries has successfully disrupted a widespread malware network, leading to the takedown of over 300 servers and the neutralization of 650 domains. Authorities have issued international arrest warrants for 20 suspects involved in the cybercrime scheme. The malware targeted, including Bumblebee and Qakbot, was used for initial system infections, allowing cybercriminals to deploy ransomware and other malicious software. This crackdown, an extension of Operation Endgame, aims to cripple the 'cybercrime as a service' ecosystem by targeting malware variants at the beginning of the cyberattack chain.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba anticipates that his June talks with U.S. President Donald Trump will mark a significant milestone in bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba stated that Japan aims to eliminate higher U.S. tariffs and rejects settling for mere reductions. This follows a phone call between Ishiba and Trump, where they agreed to explore a face-to-face summit during the G7 gathering in Canada. Japan's negotiator is expected to continue talks in Washington, urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy for mutual benefit. The premier also plans to address rising rice prices by reviewing existing output control policies to satisfy both producers and consumers.</p>

          <p>The United States is imposing new sanctions on Sudan after determining the country used chemical weapons in its ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The sanctions will restrict US exports to Sudan and limit financial borrowing, effective June 6. The Sudanese government has condemned the move, calling it a distortion of facts. The US alleges Sudan used chlorine gas, causing painful and damaging effects, and is calling on the Sudanese government to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The conflict has resulted in over 150,000 deaths.</p>

The images show the vessel lying on its side, covered by tarpaulins, with a portion on land. An official investigation, described by Kim as a 'criminal act,' has begun, though no casualties were reported. North Korea's news agency downplayed the damage, stating the hull was scratched and some seawater entered the stern, with repairs expected to take about 10 days. The shipyard manager has been summoned by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China will now be required to justify significant increases in fines and charges imposed on private companies.

The initiative aims to address issues such as arbitrary fines and inspections, unlawful enforcement, inconsistent enforcement standards, and abuse of power. The Justice Ministry's initiative involves real-time nationwide statistical analysis of enforcement activity, emphasizing the detection of unusual increases in punitive fees, as part of the government's latest economic recovery efforts.</p>

Senator Richard Blumenthal criticized the agency as 'rash and reckless,' while Representative Mark Takano expressed concerns over the impact on veterans.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to rule on a case, Kennedy v Braidwood, which could significantly impact healthcare access for the LGBTQ+ community by potentially rolling back coverage for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the HIV prevention medication.

A ruling in favor of Braidwood could lead to widespread loss of access to free preventative healthcare, affecting millions and potentially increasing HIV infections.

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for a surge in military recruitment, stating enlistments are at a 30-year high, but military records show that the upswing began before his reelection. Experts attribute the rise to recruitment reforms introduced during the Biden administration, such as prep courses for candidates struggling with enlistment requirements. While enlistments have increased year over year, they remain below recent peaks. Trump also falsely claimed enlistments fell to record lows during Biden's last year in office, when data indicates recruitment began to recover. The increase in pay for junior enlisted troops and changes in recruitment strategy have also contributed to the improved numbers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece contends that President Biden's cognitive decline was evident, particularly after his June 2024 debate, but the real issue was the lack of widespread concern. The author suggests that Biden's inner circle and the media downplayed the situation, either due to loyalty, proximity to power, or a fear of what might come next. While mistakes were made during Biden's presidency, they were viewed as predictable policy fumbles rather than signs of derangement. The author concludes that the scandal is not a conspiracy but a collective inertia, where the truth was hidden in plain sight but ignored by many elites.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax reconciliation bill, which is now heading to the Senate, proposes a national school voucher program that uses federal tax credits for donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs). These SGOs would then distribute scholarships for private school tuition and homeschooling costs. The plan is projected to facilitate billions in capital gains tax avoidance, leading critics to label it a tax shelter for the wealthy. The voucher program would be available to households earning up to 300% of an area's median income and vouchers don't improve student test scores. Experts are divided on whether vouchers ultimately benefit students, but there is evidence suggesting they may increase college attendance.</p>

The BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago, considering inflation. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offer, stating it was above inflation. The National Education Union (NEU) also expressed concerns, threatening a dispute if the government does not fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers.
