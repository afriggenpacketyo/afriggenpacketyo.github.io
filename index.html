          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move criticized by Democrats as a "nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the right to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials have vowed to sue if the waivers are revoked, as 16 other states and D.C. have adopted California's standards, which have resulted in vehicles being 99% cleaner in terms of pollution, compared to vehicles from 1970.</p>

          <p>Gazans are experiencing increasingly severe water shortages as Israel's military offensive expands, causing further displacement and depleting fuel supplies for desalination and hygiene plants. The UN's humanitarian office warns that a complete shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible without immediate fuel deliveries. Despite Israel easing some aid restrictions, fuel remains blocked, and Gazans are forced to drink salty water, leading to kidney complaints. A Unicef representative reported an 80% reduction in production at a southern Gaza desalination plant due to electricity cuts, exacerbating the already challenging water distribution process.</p>

Additionally, the amendment renames MAGA Savings Accounts to "Trump" Accounts and expedites the phase-out of some Biden-era clean energy credits. The bill also allocates $12 billion for border security reimbursements to states and ends the tax on firearm silencers.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning that a 1,000-foot-tall "mega tsunami" could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, putting cities like Seattle and Portland at risk. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake and resulting tsunami would occur rapidly, leaving little time for preparation.</p>

It would offset these changes by tightening eligibility for food and health programs.

The program has been allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes before the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>
