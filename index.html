            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has strongly criticized the United States' trade tactics, particularly those under the Trump administration, warning that attempts to trade away China's interests for temporary gains will backfire. The ministry accused Washington of using reciprocity as a pretext for unilateral economic pressure, labeling it "unilateral bullying" and a violation of international norms. They asserted that China would take firm countermeasures against any deals made at its expense, vowing to defend its rights and uphold a fair global trading system. The statement reflects escalating trade tensions and China's determination to resist US trade coercion.</p>

            <p>Ukraine's military reported a surge in Russian drone attacks across multiple regions just hours after a 30-hour Easter truce, which was declared by Moscow, came to an end. Air raid alerts were issued for the Kyiv region and several other areas, with explosions reported in Mykolaiv. Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, raising concerns about the fragile state of the conflict and the commitment to de-escalation despite the agreed-upon pause for the religious holiday. Russia's military has not yet commented on the reported attacks, further fueling uncertainty. </p>

            <p>A tragic Easter weekend in Australia saw seven drowning deaths, including a nine-year-old boy who was trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach. Most of the fatalities were attributed to strong swells that swept people into the ocean from rocks. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described it as the "worst" spate of drownings on record for the Easter long weekend. The incidents serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of coastal activities and the importance of water safety precautions.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its key lending rates steady, with the 1-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as China focuses on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, the PBOC's move signals a cautious approach to monetary policy amid external economic pressures.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan has released research outlining its base case for the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, anticipating that the effective tariff rate will rise to between 10% and 20%. While the firm expects this to result in slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and inflation, it believes the US will narrowly avoid a recession. To navigate this volatile environment, JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes for defensive exposure and income generation, as well as hedge funds for diversification and downside protection (not investment advice).</p>
