          <p>Chinese nationals in Australia are experiencing heightened insecurity following anti-immigration protests across the country. Mary Wang, a 27-year-old IT worker, cancelled plans due to the rallies, stating she feels more vulnerable as an immigrant. This sentiment reflects a broader impact on individuals who already navigate an unfamiliar environment, with such events exacerbating feelings of not belonging. The marches highlight growing social tensions and the challenges faced by immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have jointly called for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, to be followed by a permanent ceasefire. Foreign ministers of these "Quad" countries, influential with the warring Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces, proposed a nine-month transitional process towards civilian rule. The conflict has caused tens of thousands of deaths and millions displaced, leading to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. This diplomatic effort seeks to end the violence and establish a legitimate, civilian-led government, rejecting any role for extremist groups.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck early Saturday near the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka region, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake's epicenter was located 111.7 kilometers (69.3 miles) east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, with a depth of 39 kilometers. This seismic event follows a series of five powerful quakes, including another 7.4 magnitude tremor, that hit the peninsula in July 2025. The article provides factual details about the earthquake without mentioning casualties or significant damage, suggesting a neutral to slightly concerning tone.</p>

The deal, which includes lifting sanctions on Belarus' national airline, was partly brokered by the US, with some former prisoners thanking President Trump.

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican redistricting plan, backed by President Trump, aiming to create an additional GOP-leaning House seat. The new map, now awaiting the governor's signature, would make a Democratic district in Kansas City more conservative, potentially altering the state's House delegation to seven Republicans and one Democrat. Opponents, including the ACLU, have filed a legal challenge, arguing the plan is unconstitutional, rushed, and racially divisive. This move reflects a broader national effort by Republicans to reshape congressional maps before upcoming midterm elections.</p>

Serrano photographed Epstein in 2019, four months before his death, to acquire a desired sculpture, despite Epstein's criminal past. He describes Epstein as "uninteresting" apart from his crimes, who "collected people" rather than art. Conversely, Serrano finds Trump "fascinating," creating an art installation from over 1,000 Trump-related items.

Described as a feature-length outtake reel rather than a fresh take, gag encores like the drummer mortality problem feel worn out.
