          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, delivered an emotional address following his fatal shooting on a Utah university campus. Standing beside her husband's empty podcast chair, she thanked first responders, President Trump, and Vice President Vance, vowing that her husband's voice and mission would not die. She pledged to continue his campus tour and podcast, stating that the "fire ignited within this wife" would echo globally like a battle cry, unleashing a stronger movement. The article highlights Kirk's polarizing role in American political discourse, his knack for energizing young conservatives, and his instrumental work in Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" coalition. His views on gun rights, abortion, and transgender issues were often controversial.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, moving up two divisions, matched Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez's weight at Friday's weigh-in in Las Vegas, looking exceptionally fit and shredded despite the added pounds. Crawford aims to become the first male three-division undisputed champion in the modern era, challenging the defending super-middleweight champion Alvarez for his WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, and WBO titles. The weigh-in, held before a boisterous pro-Canelo crowd, set the stage for a clash where Crawford's adaptability and ring IQ will be tested against Alvarez's natural power and extensive experience at the higher weight class. Many pundits are tipping Crawford to win, highlighting the intrigue of this era-defining fight.</p>

          <p>China's instant commerce market is rapidly evolving, driven by intense competition between giants like Alibaba and Meituan, offering consumers unprecedented promotional subsidies and swift deliveries. These platforms have expanded beyond food delivery to include a wide range of products, such as Apple's new iPhone 17 models, now available for delivery in as little as 30 minutes. This "instant commerce war" is transforming China's retail landscape, pushing both online platforms and traditional brick-and-mortar stores to enhance efficiency and customer service. The fierce competition has resulted in incredibly low prices for consumers, exemplified by a cup of coffee costing just 0.01 yuan on Taobao Shangou, marking a significant shift in retail dynamics.</p>

The GOP shared a screenshot of Beckert's alleged repost of a comment stating, "They Reap What They Sow," calling it a "chilling reaction." State Republican Chairman Ben Proto condemned the action as "grotesque" and a "betrayal of values," suggesting it endorsed political violence. This article highlights the immediate and sharp partisan reactions to Kirk's death, with Proto arguing that Beckert's words read like an endorsement of political violence and questioned the example set for children. Another similar incident involving a suspended teacher in Florida is also mentioned.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer initially defended Lord Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US, unaware that No 10 and Foreign Office officials already knew about supportive emails between Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC understands a media inquiry detailing the messages was sent to the Foreign Office, which was then passed to No 10, though Mandelson did not respond to inquiries until after Starmer's initial defense. Mandelson, who was later sacked, had expressed support for Epstein in 2008 and referred to him as his "best pal" in a 2003 "birthday book," with Epstein also paying for Mandelson's travel twice. This article details the controversy and the growing pressure on Starmer regarding his handling of the appointment, as Labour MPs express concern.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that dozens of political prisoners, released as part of a US-brokered deal, were forcibly deported to Lithuania rather than truly freed. Minsk released 52 prisoners in exchange for the lifting of sanctions on Belarus' national airline, a deal facilitated by White House special envoy John Coale. While some ex-prisoners thanked President Trump, others, including Tsikhanouskaya's senior adviser, criticized the forced exile, noting many were nearing the end of their sentences and are now separated from families without passports. The opposition calls for Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko permit political prisoners to remain in their home country, highlighting that this release falls short of the thousands Trump had called for.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, potentially adding another GOP-leaning House seat and shifting the delegation to seven Republicans and one Democrat. The plan, which splits the Kansas City area, was championed by President Trump, who praised it for helping send an "additional MAGA Republican to Congress." Opponents, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the ACLU of Missouri, immediately filed a legal challenge, calling the map "unconstitutional in a host of ways" and the process "slapdash and rushed." They argue the intent is to transform a Democratic-leaning seat into a Republican-dominated one by splitting Kansas City's Black and white residents along stark racial lines, based on years-old data.</p>

          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study found that women who experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders face a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The research, which analyzed 20 years of data from nearly 66,270 American nurses, showed a 41% higher CVD risk for stalking victims and 70% higher for those who obtained a restraining order. This association persisted even after accounting for other health factors like diet and exercise, suggesting the profound toll of such trauma on physical health. Researchers hope these results will prompt doctors to include questions about stalking and restraining orders when screening for heart health risk factors in the future, ultimately aiming to improve women's health.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, false claims, conspiracy theories, and misidentifications of the suspect spread rapidly across social media, significantly fueled by AI tools. CBS News identified multiple instances where Grok, X's AI chatbot, incorrectly named the suspect and generated altered photos before official information was released, with one AI-enhanced image reposted by a sheriff's office. Other AI services like Perplexity and Google's AI Overview also provided inaccurate details, highlighting the challenge for these tools to deliver accurate, real-time information during unfolding events. Experts warn that people often perceive AI as less biased and more reliable than human sources, making this misinformation particularly dangerous and urging caution against foreign adversaries spreading disinformation.</p>

Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, focused on social media outreach and community engagement, helping Trump secure 43% of voters under 30, a better showing than any Republican since 2004. John Della Volpe of Harvard Kennedy School noted Kirk's success in organizing young men and persuading older generations to invest in his vision, highlighting his ability to display strength and masculinity.

While the total amount of unclaimed support is rising, the article notes some progress, such as increased claims for pension credit and better data use by local authorities for free school meals.

          <p>Two separate boat accidents in the Democratic Republic of Congo this week have resulted in at least 193 deaths and scores missing, occurring in the northwestern Equateur province. One boat carrying nearly 500 passengers capsized after catching fire while traveling on the Congo River, with 146 people still unaccounted for, and the fire also ignited 15 homes on the riverbank. Another motorized boat capsized at a river confluence, killing at least 86, mostly students, due to "improper loading and night navigation," which is formally prohibited.

Neighbors expressed shock, describing him as a quiet, bright student from a close-knit, Republican Mormon family, who attended Utah State University briefly. While he had no prior criminal record, a family member told investigators Robinson became more political recently and expressed dislike for Kirk, calling him "full of hate" and "spreading hate." Engravings on bullet casings found with the rifle, including "Hey fascist!

Other valuation measures, like the 12-month forward price-to-earnings and Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratios, also show market froth comparable to historical peaks in 1929, 2000, and 2021. While high valuations reflect high expectations, which have so far been met by many AI firms, the article emphasizes that such levels do not necessarily guarantee a bubble but warrant caution from investors.

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been arrested for the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, following a 33-hour manhunt that ended after his father helped persuade him to surrender to police. Robinson confessed to his father, stating he would rather take his own life than be captured, prompting his father to contact a family friend who is a court security officer, leading to his detention. Surveillance showed Robinson at Utah Valley University hours before the shooting, and he was wearing similar clothing upon arrest. Investigators recovered the suspected weapon, a Mauser .30-06 bolt action rifle, with engraved bullet casings bearing phrases like "hey fascist! CATCH!" and Italian resistance song lyrics, with prosecutors planning to file formal charges.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination exposed a deeply flawed online discourse, where information vacuums are instantly filled with "rage bait, conspiracy theorizing, doomerism, and vitriol." Even before facts emerged, blame was assigned, and AI tools amplified misinformation. The author observes a "justification machine" where facts are rearranged to fit narratives, exemplified by unverified speculation about the killer's ideology. The bullet casing inscriptions, a mix of niche online memes and nihilistic humor, suggest a "very online" shooter whose motives defy easy categorization. This alarming trend of real-world violence stemming from fringe online life highlights the toxic architecture of platforms prioritizing engagement, flattening tragedy into content.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to terminate the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has tracked emissions from over 8,000 industrial facilities since 2009, including power plants and oil refineries. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claims this move will save American businesses $2.4 billion in regulatory costs and streamline operations, while still complying with the Clean Air Act. However, environmental and health experts, including former EPA officials, warn that ending the program will "blind Americans to the facts about climate pollution," hindering policy decisions, public health protection, and climate research. The decision aligns with the administration's broader efforts to reduce support for climate research and make it harder to study the economic and societal impact of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>A US House Republican report is escalating its scrutiny of US-China academic partnerships, identifying about 50 ongoing joint institutes and degree programs as "high-risk" and calling for their termination. Congressman John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, stated that "these partnerships must end," including programs from New York University and Johns Hopkins. The report cites concerns that these collaborations could advance Beijing’s military and technological modernization, particularly if they have links to China’s "seven sons of national defence," host military-focused entities, or have ties to defense or intelligence end-uses. This move reflects House Republicans' broader campaign to curb academic ties deemed a national security risk.</p>

          <p>Controversial artist Andres Serrano discusses his portraits of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, offering insights into his motivations and perceptions of the subjects. Serrano photographed Epstein in 2019, four months before his death, to acquire a sculpture, despite Epstein being a convicted sex offender who had solicited sex from a minor. He describes Epstein as "not an interesting guy" beyond his crimes, but a collector of people. In contrast, Serrano found Trump "fascinating," collecting over 1,000 items for an art installation on him and praising his persistence as "the epitome of the American dream." The article also touches on the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's past links to Epstein and the artist's view that the Epstein story will eventually fade like the Kennedy assassination.</p>

          <p>This article offers a stark glimpse into the life of an undocumented immigrant, "Luz," in Trump's America, who expresses profound fear of leaving her home due to intensified immigration enforcement. Luz, a Mexican immigrant who has lived in the US for 17 years, describes how the previous American approach of enabling undocumented individuals to live and work has changed under the Trump administration's "stop the illegal invasion" policy. The article details frequent ICE raids, such as one where three Latino men were handcuffed without warrants, and the emotional toll on families like Luz's, whose US-citizen daughter fears her mother will be taken. The administration's stance on deporting all undocumented individuals is pushing many to consider leaving the country they've called home.</p>

          <p>A review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests the sequel, despite the return of its original cast and director Rob Reiner, fails to recapture the sharp satire of the 1984 mockumentary classic. While agreeable silliness emerges from seeing the trio, Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls, in their solo lives, the article argues that the reverence shown by real-life music legends, who appear in cameos, saps the comedy of its outsider tension. The film is criticized for relying on gag encores, such as the recurring drummer mortality problem, and for missing opportunities for comedic friction. Ultimately, the review concludes the sequel feels more like a nostalgia lap than a fresh take, leaving the original's legacy unharmed but the new film a low-wattage experience.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that the Trump administration can terminate legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This ruling, from a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lifts a district court's stay, allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for these groups while a lawsuit proceeds. The Justice Department argued that these protections were always temporary and could be revoked without court interference, citing the "gargantuan task" of individual case evaluations. Plaintiffs, who called this the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history," expressed deep disappointment, emphasizing the irreparable harm and potential separation from families, communities, and lawful employment for those affected.</p>

          <p>The federal government is suing Uber for allegedly discriminating against passengers with disabilities, including those with service dogs. The Department of Justice claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service, charge illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and impose cancellation fees after denying service. Drivers are also accused of refusing to allow disabled individuals to sit in the front seat so they can use the back for mobility devices, leading to missed appointments and being stranded. Uber states it prohibits such discrimination and requires drivers to comply with accessibility policies, noting it established a hotline in 2023 and deactivates accounts for confirmed violations. The Justice Department seeks $125 million for affected individuals who have filed complaints.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to significantly expand high-density housing near transit hubs. Introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, the bill allows for buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, seven stories within a quarter-mile, and six stories within a half-mile, aiming to address the state's severe housing shortage. Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit would be subject to these new rules. While proponents argue drastic measures are necessary, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, claim it's an overreach that strips local authority and disproportionately affects lower-priced neighborhoods.
