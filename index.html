          <p>President Trump ordered at least 2,000 National Guard troops to California in response to demonstrations against immigration raids in Los Angeles. The protests erupted following a series of raids on workplaces by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, leading to clashes between protesters and security forces. The deployment aims to quell the unrest and maintain order amid rising tensions between the federal government and local city leaders regarding immigration enforcement policies. The situation underscores the ongoing debate and conflict surrounding immigration issues in the region. The optimism score is based on the author's tone, which is neutral and informative rather than alarmist, though the situation is tense.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News contrasts President Trump's accessibility to the press with what the author characterizes as former President Biden's relative seclusion from media scrutiny. The article cites Politico's Playbook newsletter, which noted Trump's frequent appearances before TV cameras for speeches and Q&A sessions. The author criticizes journalists for allegedly posing as defenders of democracy while simultaneously attacking Trump, arguing that they did not hold Biden to the same standard. The piece concludes by suggesting that the media unfairly portrays Trump's responses to hostile questions as dangerous blather.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow, with at least 10 shot down on approach, according to the city's mayor, while a drone attack also impacted a chemical plant in the Tula region. Simultaneously, Russian forces continued long-range strikes into Ukraine, prompting President Zelenskyy to urgently request stronger air defense capabilities from the United States. Zelenskyy framed Russia's intensifying attacks as evidence of insincerity in peace negotiations and urged Western partners to increase pressure on Putin. The intensified long-range strike operations from both sides occur amid ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles continued for a second day following immigration raids, leading to clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Federal Border Patrol agents used tear gas to disperse protesters after ICE agents arrested at least 44 immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security reported that rioters assaulted ICE officers, slashed tires, and defaced buildings. Mayor Karen Bass condemned the ICE raids, while ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons criticized the protests and vowed to continue enforcing immigration laws.

          <p>Russian officials claim Ukraine is delaying a planned exchange of 6,000 bodies of soldiers who died in action. Lieutenant General Alexander Zorin stated that Russia has brought 1,212 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers to the exchange site at the border and is awaiting confirmation from the Ukrainian side. This accusation follows previous claims from both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of endangering plans to exchange prisoners of war and soldiers' bodies.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar spending package, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street. The measure would allow the U.S. to impose a new tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Some analysts are calling it a "revenge tax," which could impact cross-border income earned by hedge funds and private equity funds. The Investment Company Institute has warned that the provision could limit foreign investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, also advocates for nationwide exclusion lists to block problem gamblers. He compares regulators to those who install "seatbelt dingers" to ensure responsible behavior within the industry. The industry has rapidly expanded since 2018, often resisting restrictions proposed by states. The regulator also notes the potential of AI to promote healthy betting behaviors.</p>

          <p>Indigenous Kawésqar fishermen in Chile claim that the salmon farming industry is damaging their ancestral way of life. Reinaldo Caro, one of the last Kawésqar fishermen, decries the contamination from salmon farms, which he says impacts the seabed with feces and medication. Marine biologist Claudio Carocca notes the vulnerability of these ecosystems to changes brought by the industry. Legislation is in its final stages to deem salmon farming incompatible with the Kawésqar's traditional way of life, though debates continue over limiting concessions on new farms.</p>
