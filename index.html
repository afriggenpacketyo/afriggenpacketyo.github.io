          <p>Marina Lacerda, a key witness in the Jeffrey Epstein case, is publicly advocating for the release of all records related to the convicted sex offender, emphasizing the need for transparency to aid victims in their healing process. Lacerda, identified as "Minor-Victim 1" in Epstein's 2019 indictment, provided crucial information that led to his arrest on sex trafficking charges. She believes releasing the files would provide victims and the American people with clarity regarding the events and individuals involved. She also recounted her experience being recruited into Epstein's network as a minor and the abuse she suffered. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the release of Epstein-related documents and the Trump administration's involvement. </p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief is calling for the government to revise or clarify laws concerning online speech following the arrest of comedian Graham Linehan for posts about trans people on X. Sir Mark Rowley defended the officers' decision but acknowledged concerns about balancing free speech with the risk of inciting violence. Linehan's arrest under the Public Order Act has sparked debate among public figures and politicians regarding free speech in the UK. Sir Mark said his officers had reasonable grounds to believe an offense had been committed, but that police more broadly had been left between a rock and a hard place when investigating online speech. The police will implement a more stringent triaging process to ensure only the most serious cases are taken forward in the future. </p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond briefly exceeded 5% before slightly declining, influenced by trade policy uncertainties, budget deficits, and broader economic factors.

The activists argue that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is unlawfully impounding these funds, leading to abrupt cuts and program closures. The protest highlights the potential consequences of these funding impediments, including increased deaths and interrupted medication access.

          <p>Gold prices reached a new record high as the World Gold Council seeks to launch a digital form of the precious metal, aiming to revolutionize London’s physical gold market. This initiative would enable digital trading, settlement, and collateralization of bullion. Investors are also seeking safe havens amid equity and bond market selloffs and global economic uncertainty. The prospect of US interest-rate cuts is boosting gold's appeal.

          <p>Three parliamentarians are advocating for an investigation into the case of former Premier League players who claim they were victims of "financial abuse." Danny Murphy, Brian Deane, and Rod Wallace, part of the V11 campaign group, invested with Kingsbridge Asset Management and lost tens of millions of pounds. The MPs described the case as a failure of regulation, accountability, and duty of care. They are calling for a thorough investigation and a fair resolution to the tax dispute. </p>

          <p>The flagship podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), CrossPolitic, is serving as a platform for promoting Christian nationalist and far-right positions. Guests have included a theocratic Canadian pastor advocating for his country's annexation by the US and a "patriot professor" endorsing authoritarian regimes and criminalization of homosexuality. The podcast's themes raise questions about the influence of this movement on Pete Hegseth's views on US foreign policy.

          <p>A concerning trend has emerged on the American right, with prominent figures seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and downplay the atrocities of the Nazi regime. This revisionism is partly an attempt to provoke and signal iconoclasm, but it also reflects a desire to undo the lessons learned from World War II about the dangers of prejudice. The article highlights how figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens are pushing anti-Semitic ideas into the mainstream discourse.

          <p>The Democratic Party's strategy of forming a tight partnership with organized labor to win back working-class voters has failed. The author contends that the party's uncritical fealty to union demands can lead to policies that threaten working-class voters' material well-being. Instead, the author suggests a return to the party’s traditional, pre-Biden stance toward labor, recognizing that the political cost of satisfying the labor movement’s every demand is rising, and the number of votes that the movement delivers in return for such fealty is shrinking. Democrats need to return to their pre-Biden relationship with organized labor. (not investment advice)</p>

The scan count, which tallies those actually inside, is sometimes half the announced attendance, leading to revenue losses. Factors contributing to low attendance include the stadium's distance from campus, late start times, and lackluster opponents.

Xi Jinping said the world faces a choice between peace or war as he held China’s largest-ever military parade, joined by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un in a show of defiance to the west. Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister, said Europe and the west’s response to war in Gaza has been a failure. Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student and a permanent resident of the US, has returned to Columbia University, more than four months after being arrested, detained and nearly deported by the Trump administration for his activism. </p>
