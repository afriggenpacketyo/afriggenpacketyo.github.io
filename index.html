          <p>Israel has deported 137 international activists to Turkey after intercepting a large aid flotilla attempting to break the maritime blockade of Gaza. The flotilla, which included nearly 50 vessels, was targeted by Israeli forces in international waters, drawing condemnation from world leaders. The action has sparked significant global protests, with millions participating in demonstrations and strikes in countries like Italy and Spain. This event occurs as discussions around a ceasefire proposal outlined by President Trump continue between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat popular from the 1940s to the 1970s, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes. Once seen as a visually interesting and affordable option for middle-class families, its decline began in the 1970s due to growing health concerns about processed meats, sodium, and preservatives. While it holds a nostalgic place for some, changing consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods and global cuisines have relegated it to a niche product. Experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a major rebranding to address modern health standards.</p>

While proponents highlight benefits like lower transaction costs and faster payments, there are significant concerns about user privacy, market volatility, and the potential for financial instability. Governments are exploring different regulatory approaches, from state-run central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to more privatized systems like the one being developed in the U.S. Experts warn that a poorly regulated private system could lead to recurrent financial crises.

          <p>A peace plan proposed by U.S. President Trump suggests that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair could play a leading role in a technocratic government overseeing Gaza after a ceasefire. This potential appointment has drawn criticism, with many citing Blair's controversial history, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his previous tenure as a Middle East envoy. Despite his past efforts in the region being viewed as largely unsuccessful and pro-Israel by Palestinians, Blair has described the new peace plan as "bold and intelligent" while not confirming his potential involvement.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal, including the release of all hostages, while indicating other aspects require further negotiation. U.S. officials view the response as positive, and Israel is reportedly preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García for human smuggling may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a hearing to examine evidence of vindictive prosecution, citing "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general and the timing of the charges. The case was initiated shortly after Ábrego García successfully sued the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation and the Supreme Court ordered his return to the U.S. This legal battle has become a focal point in the broader conflict over the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million for a redress scheme to compensate individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by its former owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. The scheme, open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees, with individual compensation potentially reaching up to £385,000. This action follows numerous accusations of sexual assault against Al Fayed, who died in 2023, and a police investigation involving 146 complainants.

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has left national parks in a precarious state, with most employees furloughed and services drastically reduced. While some parks remain partially accessible, the lack of staff for maintenance, fee collection, and visitor services has led to confusion and potential risks, including unmaintained trails and increased poaching. This situation mirrors the 2018 shutdown, which saw significant damage to park resources due to unsupervised visitor activity. The shutdown not only impacts the parks but also hurts gateway communities that depend on tourism revenue, losing an estimated $80 million in visitor spending daily.</p>

          <p>Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona was not sworn into office by House Speaker Mike Johnson this week, leaving her unable to officially begin her duties. Grijalva suspects the delay is because her signature is the final one needed on a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. This legislative move is opposed by Speaker Johnson and former President Trump. A spokesperson for the Speaker indicated Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is currently delayed by the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with crimes related to their pregnancies, according to new research. Most cases involve low-income women and allegations of substance use, with laws intended to protect children being applied to fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which critics warn could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors. Experts express concern that the U.S. may be following the model of countries like El Salvador, where pregnancy complications can lead to incarceration.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has emerged as a powerful dissenting voice, using her opinions to issue stark warnings about threats to the rule of law under the Trump administration. In a notable dissent against a ruling that limited judicial checks on the president, she cited a historical analysis of Nazi Germany's legal system to caution against unchecked executive power. As the court's conservative supermajority reshapes decades of legal precedent, Jackson's writings are seen as a direct address to the American public and lower courts about the current state of democracy. Her forceful stance has drawn both praise and sharp criticism from her conservative colleagues.</p>

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early. Risher, who became Amazon's 37th employee, was instrumental in this growth, finding the opportunity to build something at that scale incredibly exciting and a defining moment in his career.</p>

          <p>Fans of Taylor Swift are speculating that a track from her new album, titled "Actually Romantic," is a response to fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song's lyrics describe another singer who writes songs about hating Swift, which fans have connected to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a promotional film, Swift described her new song as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering.

She made the change after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the "fear, pain, death" of an animal, which instantly solidified her commitment. Goodall's primary motivations were ethical opposition to factory farming and concern for the environmental damage caused by meat production.

Her journey began in the 1960s when, without formal training, she immersed herself in the world of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Her groundbreaking observation of a chimp named David Greybeard using a twig as a tool shattered the long-held belief that only humans made tools. This discovery, and the deep, trust-based relationships she formed with the animals, helped bridge the gap between humans and other species, leaving a lasting legacy in science and conservation.</p>
