        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and CUNY testified before a U.S. House committee regarding antisemitism on their campuses. The university officials condemned antisemitism but defended their commitment to protecting free speech, detailing disciplinary actions taken while pushing back against claims that campuses are unique hotbeds for such bias. Democrats on the committee criticized the hearing as political theater, arguing it distracts from the administration's moves to dismantle the Department of Education, which investigates civil rights violations. Republicans, however, accused the universities of allowing antisemitism to persist unchecked through hiring and union practices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has disclosed that a secret scheme was established to relocate thousands of Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked their personal data. The breach, which occurred in 2022, exposed the details of nearly 19,000 people who had applied for UK resettlement, with the government only learning of it when the data appeared on Facebook in 2023. So far, 4,500 individuals have been moved to the UK under the £400m program, the existence of which was concealed by a super-injunction until a court lifted it. Defence Secretary John Healey offered a sincere apology for the serious error.</p>

          <p>Russia has granted citizenship to Daniel Martindale, an American man who spied on Ukrainian military facilities for Moscow's intelligence services. According to Russian state media, Martindale spent two years in Ukraine following the 2022 invasion, transmitting coordinates of troop locations while posing as a missionary. The head of the Russian-occupied Donetsk region stated Martindale had proven his loyalty and was extracted in a special operation. In a video, Martindale expressed gratitude, calling Russia his home and family, and stating that becoming a citizen was a dream come true.</p>

          <p>The Russian government has formally rejected President Trump's demand for a ceasefire in Ukraine within 50 days, labeling the proposal an unacceptable ultimatum. Trump had threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries doing business with Russia if a deal was not reached. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister stated that Moscow prefers a diplomatic path but will continue its military operation until its goals are met, urging Washington to take this position seriously. The Kremlin spokesperson described Trump's announcement as significant and said it required time for analysis, signaling continued diplomatic and military tension.</p>

          <p>The FBI has arrested Benjamin Song, a 32-year-old former U.S. Marine Corps reservist, in connection with a July 4th attack on an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas.

According to the criminal complaint, Song is accused of firing AR-15-style rifles at federal and local law enforcement officers, injuring one. He now faces multiple federal charges, including attempted murder of a federal officer, as authorities continue their investigation into the coordinated attack.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any information on Jeffrey Epstein that she deems credible, responding to pressure from his supporters. The statement follows backlash against Bondi after she said there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list," a comment that angered many in the MAGA base who believe a cover-up is protecting influential figures. Despite previously urging supporters to move on from the topic, Trump is now deferring to his attorney general's judgment.

The pressure stems from an economic model focused on industrial output, where fierce competition and weak domestic demand are squeezing corporate profits and, in turn, worker compensation.

          <h2>Bipartisan Lawmakers Reintroduce Comprehensive Immigration Reform Legislation</h2>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at addressing border security and the status of undocumented immigrants. The bill proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a seven-year path to legal status for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The reintroduction comes as the Trump administration's mass deportation program faces legal challenges and protests. Proponents argue the legislation provides a necessary alternative to the current cycle of amnesty versus deportation, benefiting families and the economy.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an ambitious five-year renovation project costing £50 million. The historic Victorian glasshouse, which opened in 1848, requires extensive repairs due to rusting ironwork caused by its internal tropical rainforest environment. The project involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass and carefully relocating 1,300 plants, some of which are centuries old. A key goal of the makeover is to upgrade the heating system to air and water source heat pumps, making the landmark building net-zero in emissions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its product can help people feel calm and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that the ad's language, including phrases like "crafted for calm," implied benefits that are not permitted on the national register for food and supplement marketing. The ruling also noted that claims about the drink's ingredients reducing stress hormones were in breach of advertising codes. Trip, a popular non-alcoholic CBD brand, stated it has removed the claims while it seeks further advice.</p>

          <p>Julian Smith, a former Northern Ireland Secretary, has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron for his handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum, describing it as "extremely cavalier." Smith argued that holding the vote without a clear plan for either outcome was unforgivable, especially given the complex issue of the Irish border, and likened the approach to an "Eton game." Speaking on a BBC podcast, Smith, who served as chief whip under Theresa May, reflected on the ensuing political turmoil as a "pretty disastrous period" where moderate positions hardened into purism on both sides.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for insurrection, South Korea's former spy chief Kim Jae-gyu is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim, who was a longtime friend of the president, claimed he acted to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, while prosecutors argued it was a power grab. The retrial was granted based on evidence that Kim was tortured into a confession and that his original military trial was unjust. The case re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history and forces a national reflection on democracy, justice, and the controversial legacies of both men.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff, a long-time political adversary of Trump, dismissed the claim as a baseless and weak attempt at political retribution. A memo from Fannie Mae investigators noted possible "occupancy misrepresentation" but did not accuse Schiff of fraud. Schiff's spokesperson stated he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and Maryland and followed all laws. Schiff suggested the accusation was an attempt to distract from the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.</p>

Johnson stated that while he trusts the president, Bondi needs to clarify the situation.

The surprise defeat, with 13 Republicans joining Democrats, stalls the legislation, which was a top priority for the crypto industry during the House's "Crypto Week." The bills included the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins and another to clarify oversight between the SEC and CFTC. The failure represents a rare legislative rebuke of Trump from within his own party and creates uncertainty for the future of digital asset regulation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has struck down a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports. The Biden-era policy was designed to prevent healthcare expenses from negatively impacting Americans' credit scores and access to loans. However, the judge ruled that the CFPB had exceeded its authority. Consumer advocacy groups called the decision a disappointing setback that sides with corporate interests over the public. Conversely, credit industry associations praised the ruling, arguing that information about unpaid medical debts is an important factor in assessing a borrower's ability to pay.</p>
