          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy with its dark brown hair still intact. Archaeologists believe the well-preserved female remains date back to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which thrived from 1000 to 1470 A.D. The discovery highlights the rich archaeological heritage of the Lima region, where experts say it is common to find such pre-Hispanic funerary remains due to the area's long history of human habitation.</p>

The pandas are being transferred to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, leaving only two giant pandas remaining in Japan.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention on endangered species, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for eel trade if adopted. The measure, set to take effect in 2027, aims to protect dwindling eel populations globally but could significantly impact markets that rely on eel imports.</p>

The new setup involved teams making selections from their home cities while top prospects gathered in Los Angeles, leading to an awkward and slow-paced event marked by technical glitches. Critics argue the decentralized format lacks the excitement and personal connection of having all teams, players, and families together in one arena for the momentous occasion.</p>
