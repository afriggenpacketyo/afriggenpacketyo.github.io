          <p>Kathleen Kingsbury reflects on the deportation of Qian Xuesen, a Chinese rocket scientist, by the U.S. government in 1955, highlighting the long-term implications of this decision. Despite being cleared of sedition and espionage charges, Qian was traded back to Communist Beijing and played a pivotal role in developing China's missile and space programs. Kingsbury draws parallels between this historical event and the Trump administration's targeting of foreign students and researchers, cautioning against xenophobia-driven policies that could undermine American scientific dominance. The article suggests that the U.S. should learn from past mistakes to avoid repeating them in the current political climate. </p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities anticipate a public notice easing the blanket ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and the opening of registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue advocating for the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, implemented after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This move is viewed as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two nations, potentially leading to solutions for other bilateral issues.</p>

          <p>Businesses near Fort Bragg in North Carolina are facing financial burdens due to the base's name changing back to Fort Bragg after a brief period as Fort Liberty. Ralph Rodriguez, owner of Fort Liberty Pawn & Gun, estimates it will cost him $30,000 to change his signage, uniforms, and licensing. The name change was initially prompted by a campaign promise to restore Confederate officer names to military installations, but it was later reversed, leaving businesses to adapt. Some businesses are sticking with the name Liberty, while others are switching back to Bragg, highlighting the challenges and costs associated with the renaming process.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, cautions that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the China-US rivalry. While he believes full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, he suggests the U.S. could gradually expand sanctions targeting specific Chinese entities, potentially pushing China out of the US dollar system. Lian argues that implementing full-blown sanctions, such as cutting China off from SWIFT or freezing its US dollar assets, would be difficult and damaging to the system itself. He notes that excluding China from SWIFT could lead countries to shift to China's alternative payment system, CIPS, undermining Swift's importance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the trade court's ruling would undermine presidential power and destabilize trade negotiations. The appeals court's decision provides temporary relief for the administration while it prepares to argue for a longer stay during the appeals process. The ruling invalidated tariffs issued as part of Trump's plan to reshape international trade, but Trump officials insist they have alternative options for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case.

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year, largely due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. The report, which surveyed over 900 business travel professionals, revealed that positive sentiment fell from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025. Nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, and a third have changed or are considering changing policies regarding travel to or from the United States. The report suggests that the decisions of the Trump Administration are causing long-term concerns, particularly regarding business travel costs and visa processing problems.

She argues that Britain cannot afford their economic policies and that the country deserves leaders who do not "treat economics like a branch of showbiz."
