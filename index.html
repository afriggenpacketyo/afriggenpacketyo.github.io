        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved a bill providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill is necessary to support law enforcement officers making split-second decisions, while Democrats express concerns that it could lead to unjustified violence against Black people. The bill allows an immunity hearing to determine if an officer acted recklessly outside their duties and requires law enforcement departments to track use-of-force complaints. Civil rights attorneys have voiced concerns that the law could embolden misconduct, while others believe its impact will be limited due to federal lawsuits remaining unaffected. </p>

          <p>The BBC reports on the evacuation of a small group of injured Gazan children to Jordan for medical treatment after 19 months of war, offering a glimpse of hope amidst the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Four sick children, along with their parents, were transported from Gaza to Amman, Jordan, where they will receive medical care. While Jordan aims to bring 2,000 sick children for treatment, Israeli restrictions have slowed the evacuation process. The article highlights the dire conditions in Gaza, where the majority of the population faces famine due to the Israeli blockade and continued bombing, according to the UN. The article recounts the story of one Gazan child who underwent a triple amputation in Jordan due to a rare skin condition.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its intention to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, potentially marking a turning point in Turkish politics. This decision has sparked celebrations and raised questions about the future of Kurdish political movements and the broader political landscape in Turkey. Experts suggest that the dissolution of the PKK could lead to a shift in political dynamics, particularly for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). Uncertainties remain regarding the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential impact on neighboring nations, especially in northern Syria where the YPG, considered an offshoot of the PKK, holds control.</p>

Milei's government defends the changes as a way to "make Argentina great again," while critics worry about the impact on the country's tradition of openness. The decree also introduces fees for foreigners accessing public health care and education, aiming to ensure the sustainability of these systems amidst government spending cuts.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. The IMF expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate in the coming years but believes the country is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. This is because Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, contracting manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship the products. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, but heightened trade tensions and trade policy uncertainty pose risks to the outlook.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices, releasing 100,000 tons per month for three months through July, in addition to previous auctions. The shortage is attributed to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was initially cautious but decided on the release with a condition that the same amount of rice is bought back within a year. The government is considering relaxing the buyback requirement to encourage more distributors to participate in auctions.</p>

The expansion reflects the region's growing aviation market, with airports in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions poised for extensive development.

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a tax bill that would cut billions in climate-related funding and prematurely phase out clean energy tax credits to fund President Trump's tax cuts. The bill targets key climate and energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, impacting renewable energy, manufacturing, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Simultaneously, the bill proposes streamlining permitting for fossil fuels and rescinding Clean Air Act pollution funding. Environmental groups and renewable energy companies are lobbying against the cuts, arguing they are vital to support new industries and that 75% of the affected credits and spending cuts would affect local economies in Republican districts.</p>

The document, bought for just $27.50 in 1946, has been tucked away in the archives for decades, its true identity unknown. The professors believe it is from the town of Appleby, Cumbria, and its journey to Harvard involves the Lowthers, a land-owning family who gave the Magna Carta to Thomas Clarkson, a leading abolitionist of the 1780s.</p>

The commission hopes the change will benefit consumers by helping reduce prices and improve access to convenient apps.
