          <p>Brett James, the Grammy-winning songwriter known for co-writing Carrie Underwood's hit "Jesus, Take the Wheel," has died at age 57 in a plane crash. The small aircraft, which was registered to James, crashed in a wooded area near Franklin, North Carolina, with no survivors among the three people on board. Tributes have poured in from the music and sports communities, including from ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit and country singer Jason Aldean, who remembered James for his immense talent, humility, and profound impact on their lives and careers. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed significant issues with counterfeit goods and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party online marketplace. Shoppers seeking deals have sometimes received fake and potentially dangerous products, as the retailer allegedly relaxed its seller vetting process to compete with Amazon. The report found numerous instances of sellers using stolen identities of legitimate businesses, including a pizza parlor, to open accounts and sell fraudulent items like luxury face creams and health supplements. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its vetting procedures for sellers in health and beauty categories, stating that trust and safety are top priorities.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, resigned from his position after facing intense pressure from the Trump administration to pursue criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The resignation occurred shortly after President Trump publicly stated, "I want him out," and reports emerged that Siebert's office had concluded a five-month investigation without finding sufficient evidence to indict James on allegations of mortgage fraud. This development has heightened concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and its historical independence, as critics argue it is part of a broader effort to target the president's political rivals.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the individual accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year. The prosecution's final witness, an FBI special agent, presented evidence suggesting Routh spent a month conducting surveillance while living out of a gas station. Prosecutors allege that Routh, who is representing himself, had a methodical plan involving a military-grade weapon and burner phones to kill the then-presidential nominee. Routh was allegedly spotted by a Secret Service agent before he could act and now faces five criminal charges, including attempted assassination.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military has conducted a third "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat in international waters suspected of trafficking narcotics, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." The strike is part of a broader administration strategy to target drug cartels, which have been designated as terrorist organizations, and comes amid heightened tensions with Venezuela, though no country of origin was named for this specific vessel.

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would involve its sale to a group of American investors, including Oracle. While Trump expressed optimism and plans to meet Xi at the APEC summit, Chinese state media offered a more reserved account, stating Beijing welcomes negotiations based on market rules. A key unresolved issue appears to be the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm. The development marks a shift in a long-running dispute that previously saw Trump threaten to ban the popular social media platform over national security concerns.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over three decades, has caused shock and sympathy within her community. Kaur, whose asylum application was denied years ago, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during a routine check-in, a practice she had followed for 13 years. Her family and lawyer report she is in distress and being denied proper care, while politicians like Congressman John Garamendi are requesting her release. ICE maintains that Kaur has exhausted all legal remedies and that they are enforcing a judge's removal order from 2005.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old Hawaiian monk seal named Moana was found dead on Mānana Island, having become entangled in fishing gear from a practice known as "jug fishing." This method uses strong lines and a floating jug, which can lead to exhaustion and death for marine animals if the line breaks. The death of Moana, one of only about 1,600 Hawaiian monk seals remaining, has prompted renewed calls from wildlife officials for more responsible and sustainable fishing practices. Authorities are urging fishers to avoid high-risk methods, report lost gear immediately, and use equipment like barbless circle hooks to protect the endangered species.</p>

The writer ironically frames these events as signs of American strength and moxie, while also touching on other administration policies, such as those from the Department of Health and Human Services under Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The piece uses sarcasm to critique what it portrays as hypocrisy and authoritarian tendencies, culminating in a suggestion that everyone, including Kimmel, should wear hats proclaiming they are "right about everything," mocking a hat worn by the president.</p>

The committee, however, was tied on whether to require a formal prescription, with the chair breaking the tie to vote against it. This move away from a broad, universal recommendation is expected to decrease vaccine uptake and create confusion, as it places a greater burden on patients to initiate vaccination discussions.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke the licenses of broadcast networks have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media. Broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox require licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used to address issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is invoking it based on perceived political bias.

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St James's Park in central London. Jennings, who has previously sculpted King Charles III and the Queen Mother, stated his intention to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of the late monarch. He plans to consult with the Royal Family and listen to public sentiment before finalizing the design, which will be revealed in 2026. The broader memorial project, with a budget between £23m and £46m, will also include a statue of Prince Philip and new gardens.</p>

          <p>Russia has revived Intervision, a Soviet-era song contest, as its alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event, a brainchild of President Vladimir Putin, features 23 countries, including allies from the Brics and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation groups like China, Brazil, and South Africa. The contest is framed by the Kremlin as a way to promote cultural cooperation but is viewed by critics, particularly Ukraine, as a political project to showcase Russia's international friendships and divert attention from the war. The contest emphasizes traditional and family values, distinguishing itself from the kitschier style of Eurovision.</p>

          <p>Recent multi-billion pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Microsoft and Google are highlighting a growing confidence in the United Kingdom's potential as an AI superpower. During President Trump's state visit, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced strong support for the UK's tech research capabilities, and Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment to expand its AI infrastructure in the country. This influx of capital is seen as a significant boost to the UK economy, positioning the Silicon Valley-London-Cambridge "Golden Triangle" as a global hub for AI development, though some critics worry about over-reliance on American technology.</p>

While promoting his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed that a "Peaky Blinders" movie is forthcoming from Netflix but kept plot details confidential to maintain the surprise for fans.

          <p>Federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse approximately 100 protesters outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago. Demonstrators, including two congressional candidates, were attempting to block government vehicles during "Operation Midway Blitz," an immigration crackdown in the city. At least three arrests were made during the clashes, which saw agents in riot gear fire projectiles from a rooftop. Illinois's lieutenant governor, who was present earlier, condemned the response as an attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate and silence peaceful protesters.</p>

          <p>UCLA has released new campus protest regulations ahead of the fall term, formalizing interim policies that ban unauthorized encampments and the use of masks during policy violations. While some rules align with Trump administration demands to crack down on demonstrators, such as prohibiting protests at Royce Quad, others expand free speech zones and permit pre-approved overnight events, which the White House wants to ban. The university stated the guidelines aim to balance free speech with safety and are not a direct reaction to federal pressure, though they come as UCLA faces the threatened loss of research funding over its handling of past protests.</p>

          <p>Estonia has requested an urgent consultation with its NATO allies under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government condemned the incursion as "brazen," prompting NATO to immediately scramble jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden to intercept the aircraft. This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4 due to Russian aerial activity, following a similar incident with Poland. The event has significantly heightened tensions, with top EU officials calling it a dangerous provocation and a test of the West's resolve.</p>
