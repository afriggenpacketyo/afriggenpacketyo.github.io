            <p>Technology stocks experienced a significant downturn on Tuesday, reversing earlier gains as market optimism surrounding potential tariff reductions waned. The Nasdaq saw a sharp decline, with major tech companies like Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, and Nvidia all experiencing losses. The market's initial rally was fueled by hopes of negotiated tariff reductions, but these hopes were dashed by concerns that agreements would not be reached before new tariffs take effect. This volatility follows recent market turbulence sparked by President Trump's tariff plans, with trading volume reaching near two-decade highs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US small businesses are bracing for financial hardship as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs are set to take effect, imposing new import duties on goods from across the globe. Many small businesses fear they will have to raise prices for consumers or absorb the costs themselves, impacting their bottom lines. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable due to their limited financial flexibility compared to larger corporations. Some businesses are already reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans to cope with the increased costs. This situation occurs as consumer confidence is already slumping, raising concerns about the broader economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the capture of two Chinese men fighting for Russia in the eastern Donetsk region, stating Ukraine has information that there are "significantly more" Chinese nationals fighting alongside the Russians. Zelenskyy has requested his top diplomat to contact Beijing and find out how China is going to react to this. This development puts into question China's declared stance for peace and undermines Beijing's credibility as a responsible permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, according to Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga. The U.S. State Department described the discovery as disturbing, noting that continued cooperation between these two nuclear powers will only further contribute to global instability.</p>

            <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that Apple should manufacture iPhones in the U.S. to avoid new tariffs, tech analyst Laura Martin expressed skepticism, citing significantly increased costs. Martin stated that moving Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would take years and that complete domestic production is likely impossible. Other analysts have echoed this concern, with some estimating that a U.S.-made iPhone could cost as much as $3,500. Martin also noted that Trump's tariffs will push Apple's costs approximately 50% higher. (not investment advice)</p>

However, production of the smaller XT5 crossover will continue at the plant until at least the end of 2026. A GM spokesman said the changes are unrelated to tariffs, and are part of the brand's plans to offer a full lineup of all-electric cars, crossovers and SUVs. Cadillac has rolled out six new or updated products in the past year or so, including EVs and gas-powered vehicles.</p>

            <p>The UK government is actively considering nationalizing British Steel to secure the future of the Scunthorpe plant, which is owned by Chinese firm Jingye. Discussions have intensified due to US tariffs and stalled talks about financial support for transitioning to less polluting technology. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said all options are on the table, including buying materials to keep the blast furnaces operational. Nigel Farage called for immediate nationalization to prevent closure, while Starmer emphasized the UK's commitment to a functioning steel industry despite challenges from Trump's tariffs.</p>

            <p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres described Gaza as a "killing field" as Israel has blocked the entry of all goods and resumed the war against Hamas. The heads of six UN agencies appealed to world leaders to act urgently to ensure food and supplies reach Palestinians. Israel blockaded Gaza on 2 March, after the first stage of a ceasefire expired. Guterres said Israel, as the occupying power, had obligations under international law to ensure that food and medical supplies get to the population. Because of the blockade, all UN-supported bakeries have closed, markets are empty of most fresh vegetables and hospitals are rationing painkillers and antibiotics.</p>
