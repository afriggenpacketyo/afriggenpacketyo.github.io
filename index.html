          <p>The lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell stated his client did a "wonderful job" during two days of meetings with a top Justice Department official, answering questions about approximately 100 different people without holding back. The attorney emphasized that Maxwell has been treated unfairly and is now telling the truth, though no offers of clemency have been made in exchange for her cooperation. Meanwhile, President Trump deflected questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting focus should be on others like Bill Clinton, and said he has not thought about a pardon for Maxwell.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, known as the "doomsday mom," was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece's ex-husband. This sentencing follows her existing life sentences in Idaho for murdering two of her children. Prosecutors argued her motives were money and sex, driven by a desire to be with her new husband, Chad Daybell, and justified by their "twisted" religious beliefs about zombies. During the hearing, victims' families delivered emotional statements, describing her as the source of their family's tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Centuries-old Hawaiian petroglyphs have become visible again on a beach in Oahu for the first time in years, attracting tourists and locals. These ancient lava rock carvings, known as kiʻi pōhaku, were revealed after seasonal ocean swells washed away the sand that covered them. The stick figure-like etchings were created by Native Hawaiians, and while their exact meaning is uncertain, researchers believe they may represent birth records or commemorate other significant events. The images depict human forms, canoes, and various other objects from the islands' history.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has reached her first semi-final of 2025 by defeating Maria Sakkari in straight sets at the Washington Open. Raducanu staged an impressive comeback in the second set, winning five consecutive games after being down 5-2. She attributed her success to hard work building her confidence and acknowledged the brutal heat, which made her feel "a bit wobbly" during the match. This victory continues a strong tournament run for Raducanu, who previously beat Naomi Osaka and the seventh seed, Marta Kostyuk.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland to open a new course at his Trump International Golf Links, local opinions remain sharply divided. Some residents, who refused to sell their properties during the course's development, express resentment over the transformation of the natural landscape and Trump's past behavior. However, others in the area point to the positive economic impact, including the jobs the resort provides. Despite planned protests and polls showing widespread unfavorable views of Trump in Scotland, the visit highlights the complex legacy of his business ventures in his mother's homeland.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are pushing for legislation, such as the No Secret Police Act, to prohibit federal agents from wearing non-tactical masks that conceal their identities during law enforcement actions. The move is a response to images of masked agents conducting immigration arrests, which have raised concerns among civil liberties advocates. While federal action is unlikely with a Republican majority, states like California and New York are considering similar bills. Law enforcement groups oppose the ban, citing new digital threats like doxing and the need to protect officers' identities during protests.</p>

          <p>A contributor article argues that the public shaming of the couple caught in an apparent affair on a concert kiss-cam, while seemingly cruel, is actually a healthy societal function. The author posits that the widespread humor and ridicule are not signs of decadence but reflect a society that still takes marriage vows seriously. This collective laughter is presented as a recognition of shared human fallibility and a rejection of elite rationalizations for infidelity, ultimately reinforcing traditional community values about loyalty and commitment.</p>

While also mentioning paying down the national debt as a priority, he suggested the rebate could be targeted at people of a certain income level. Experts are uncertain whether such a plan could be implemented without congressional approval and have raised concerns that it could potentially fuel further inflation in the economy.

          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe died by suicide and that there were "shortcomings" in the mental healthcare he received in the months prior. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive the 55-year-old to be in a crisis, even after his wife informed them he was asking for help to end his life. The coroner noted that Thorpe had not been seen in person by mental health services for over four months before his death at a railway station.</p>

          <p>A review of Marvel's new movie, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," finds it to be a visually handsome reboot with a strong cast, but one that ultimately lacks a sense of fun. The film dispenses with the team's origin story and dives directly into a portentous, world-ending conflict with the villain Galactus. This focus on apocalyptic menace comes at the expense of developing the quirky, bickering family dynamic and playful chemistry that are central to the appeal of the classic comic book characters, leaving the adventure feeling overly serious.</p>
