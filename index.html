          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six staff members following an investigation into the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. A new report deemed the incident, where a gunman killed an attendee and grazed Trump's ear, an "operational failure." The agency acknowledged its accountability and has since implemented reforms, including improved technology and better coordination with local law enforcement, to prevent future security lapses. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days without pay, come nearly a year after the attack.</p>

          <p>Authorities have found more suspected asbestos fragments at five locations near a contentious bonfire site in south Belfast, raising public health concerns ahead of the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. Despite the discovery and risks to a nearby electricity substation, police have decided not to assist in dismantling the structure, citing a lower risk compared to intervention. The situation highlights deep-seated cultural and political tensions, with bonfire builders making minor concessions while local politicians remain divided over the proper course of action.</p>

          <p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that emergency room visits for tick bites are at their highest rate in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute the increase to record-high tick populations and a longer tick season, likely driven by climate change. Ticks can transmit numerous illnesses, including Lyme disease, making the rise in bites a significant public health concern. Health officials are urging the public to take preventative measures, such as using insect repellent and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is compelling former Biden administration aides to testify in a congressional probe into Joe Biden's health by waiving executive privilege, a legal shield he once fought fiercely to protect. This move is a stark reversal from his stance during the Jan. 6 investigation, when he argued that overriding a former president's privilege would do "grave damage" to the presidency. Constitutional experts worry this sets a dangerous precedent, potentially turning the privilege into a political weapon used by successive administrations against their rivals and chilling candid advice.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House. The meeting coincides with Nvidia becoming the first company to close a trading day with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the meeting's agenda is unclear, Nvidia has been grappling with the Trump administration's export controls on its advanced AI chips to China, which the company says has effectively closed off a $50 billion market. The discussion could touch on these national security-related trade restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>
