          <p>A transgender darts player, Noa-Lynn van Leuven, has publicly spoken out against a new World Darts Federation policy that prohibits biological males from competing in women's events. In a social media post, van Leuven expressed heartbreak over the decision, framing it as a loss for the transgender community in sports and arguing that the pursuit of "fairness" is resulting in exclusion. The policy follows a trend in various sports and comes after some female competitors refused to play against van Leuven, who has since moved to a different professional circuit.</p>

          <p>FICO's CEO, Will Lansing, has responded to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regarding the cost of its credit scores for mortgages. Lansing argued that the $4.95 price for a mortgage score is a minimal part of the overall $6,000 in closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. This defense comes after the FHFA allowed lenders to use rival VantageScore and criticized FICO for its price increases, which Lansing countered by highlighting FICO's dominant market share and superior predictive accuracy.

          <p>Colombia experienced a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a positive trend of decline. The Amazon region was the most severely impacted, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of destroyed forest. Authorities attribute the surge to factors like land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, illicit crop cultivation, and wildfires exacerbated by climate change. Despite this spike, the overall deforestation rate remains below 2021 levels.</p>

President Trump has yet to make a final decision, stating he will do so after being briefed on recent talks led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, financial experts suggest it may be an opportune time for savers to renew maturing certificates of deposit (CDs). Current CD rates remain high, often over 4%, providing a secure way to grow savings before potential future rate cuts. The article advises savers to act before their CDs automatically roll over, potentially into accounts with lower rates, and to shop around for the best available terms. This period of paused rates offers a window to lock in favorable returns for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

The brand, Breezy Swimwear, claims that the tour's name and merchandise create consumer confusion with its own annual "Breezy Bowl" fashion event, which has been held since 2023. The lawsuit, filed in a Florida court, seeks an injunction to stop Brown from using the name and demands monetary damages equal to the profits made from the allegedly infringing marks. Brown's tour recently began its U.S. leg in Miami.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm system has prompted states of emergency in New York City and New Jersey, bringing torrential rainfall and dangerous flash floods to the U.S. East Coast. Forecasters warned of rainfall rates up to three inches an hour, leading to submerged highways, suspended commuter rail service, and widespread flight cancellations. Officials urged residents to avoid travel and for those in basement apartments to move to higher ground, as the combination of saturated ground and intense downpours created hazardous conditions throughout the region.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide this year, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he was aware Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre and other employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. In their statement, the family questioned what Trump knew about Epstein's criminal activities and when, demanding answers for survivors. The White House responded by reiterating that Trump had banned Epstein from his club for inappropriate behavior toward female employees.</p>

          <p>England pace bowler Chris Woakes is expected to miss the rest of the final Test match against India after suffering a shoulder injury on the first day of play. Woakes was injured while trying to stop a boundary and left the field in visible discomfort. The injury is a significant blow to England's already depleted bowling attack, which is missing several key players. At 36, the injury also raises concerns about the future of Woakes's international cricket career, particularly ahead of the upcoming Ashes tour.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that changes to federal student loan programs under the new "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will create significant barriers for students pursuing professional degrees in fields like law and medicine. The new law caps federal loans at $50,000 per year, leaving a substantial funding gap for expensive programs at universities like the UC system. The author fears this will prevent many working-class students from entering these critical professions and urges the state of California to create its own loan programs to bridge the gap and maintain a talent pool of future doctors and lawyers.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that recent agreements between elite universities like Columbia and Brown and the Trump administration are compromising academic freedom. Facing accusations of civil rights violations and the threat of withheld federal funding, these institutions have agreed to demands such as cutting DEI programs, altering curricula, and cracking down on student protests. The article argues these settlements, particularly the comprehensive Columbia deal, create a blueprint for political coercion that could ripple across all of higher education, emboldening the administration to exert control over campus policies and speech.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, with 250 remaining to protect federal property. The troops were part of a larger 5,000-member force deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to address protests related to federal immigration policies. The deployment was met with strong opposition from California state and local leaders, who argued it was unnecessary and pulled resources from other critical duties. The withdrawal was praised by local politicians, who are pushing for all remaining troops to be removed.</p>

The U-turn came after thousands of young Ukrainians participated in the largest anti-government protests since Russia's full-scale invasion, demanding the government protect the agencies' autonomy. The independence of these bodies is a crucial condition for Ukraine's EU candidacy and for maintaining the trust of Western partners who provide critical financial aid for the country's war effort and economy.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell after the company reported second-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, which was slightly below analyst expectations. While net income was high due to investment gains, revenue from transactions missed estimates as retail trading volume slowed compared to the previous quarter. The company's subscription and services revenue also grew but fell short of projections. Coinbase announced plans to expand its offerings beyond crypto to include tokenized real-world assets and derivatives to boost consumer engagement. (not investment advice)</p>
