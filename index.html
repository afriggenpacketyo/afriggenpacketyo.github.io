          <p>President Trump confirmed that U.S. personnel are being moved out of certain areas in the Middle East due to escalating tensions with Israel and Iran, stating it could be a dangerous place. The State Department had already ordered the departure of nonessential staff from the embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, citing increased security risks. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from various locations across the Middle East. Trump reiterated that Iran cannot possess a nuclear weapon, as the administration continues to work toward a deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The United States is conducting a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to heightened security risks. Non-essential staff and their dependents are being removed, though officials have not specified the exact nature of the threat. This decision coincides with stalled talks regarding Iran's nuclear program, as the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, which could be used for nuclear weapons, in exchange for easing economic sanctions. President Trump expressed diminishing confidence in reaching a deal with Iran, contributing to the overall sense of instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted raids at a Los Angeles car wash, resulting in the arrest of several undocumented workers, including Jesus Cruz, who had worked there for over a decade. The raids, part of a broader White House strategy, have intensified anxieties among immigrant communities in Los Angeles County, where a significant portion of the population lacks legal status. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to inquiries about the legal status of those arrested or the specific goals of the operation. Mayor Karen Bass emphasized the widespread fear among Angelenos, unsure of where and when ICE may strike next, prompting concerns about daily activities like sending children to school or going to work.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, while the jury found him not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding accuser Kaja Sokola and could not reach a verdict on the third degree rape charge involving Jessica Mann. The jury reported tense deliberations, including an alleged threat made by one juror to another. Weinstein expressed his belief that he was not receiving a fair trial amidst the infighting. Despite not being found guilty on all counts, Weinstein's publicist considered the split verdict a victory, while Sokola's lawyer emphasized the significance of her testimony in bringing down a man who believed he was untouchable.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, who passed away at 82, is remembered as a visionary musician whose work with the Beach Boys defined the sound and spirit of Southern California. His ability to blend complex musical elements into seemingly effortless songs placed him among the greats like Phil Spector and George Martin. Wilson's genius lay in his control of emotion, articulating feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment through his music. Despite battling mental illness, Wilson continued to create, leaving behind a legacy of timeless classics and a profound influence on popular music.</p>

Khalil, who has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March, missed the birth of his first child due to his detainment.

          <p>Frito-Lay has closed its manufacturing plant in Rancho Cucamonga, ending over five decades of snack food production and eliminating hundreds of jobs. The plant, a major employer since 1970, gained cultural significance as the birthplace of Flaminâ€™ Hot Cheetos. PepsiCo Foods U.S., the parent company of Frito-Lay, confirmed the closure and stated its commitment to supporting affected employees with pay and benefits. The closure is part of a broader pattern of PepsiCo facility shutdowns amid declining snack sales, as the company aims to "right-size the cost" of its snacks division.</p>
