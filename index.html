        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid record-high home equity levels in the United States, homeowners have several affordable options for borrowing. A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) currently offers the lowest interest rates, with the advantage of a variable rate that could decrease further following anticipated Federal Reserve cuts. Alternatively, a home equity loan provides the stability of a fixed interest rate, protecting borrowers from future market volatility. For seniors aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage presents a unique option where repayment is deferred until the home is sold or the owner passes away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has brought significant disruption to Northern Ireland and Scotland, with high winds and heavy rain prompting multiple weather warnings from the Met Office. The storm has led to the cancellation of flights and trains, the closure of major roads like the M1 and Foyle Bridge, and an advisory for schools in several counties to close early. An amber warning for wind gusts up to 80mph is in effect for western areas, while yellow warnings for wind and rain cover all of Northern Ireland, causing widespread public safety measures.</p>

          <p>Newly-elected UK Green Party leader Zack Polanski has proposed a tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to end what he calls "rip-off Britain" and fund essential public services. In his conference speech, he argued this revenue could support universal free childcare, special needs education, and rural bus routes. Polanski, who identifies as an "eco-populist," also strongly defended migrants and refugees while criticizing the Labour Party for, in his view, following the lead of Reform UK on immigration policy, thereby shifting the party's focus to social inequality.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Sean Combs, federal prosecutors pushed for a significant prison sentence, arguing that his crimes involved not just prostitution but also "staggering" violence. The judge expressed skepticism about Combs's remorse, noting that the music mogul has not fully accepted factual guilt for the conduct for which he was convicted. The court also indicated it may consider testimony and evidence from charges on which Combs was acquitted as relevant context for the sentencing, highlighting the coercive nature of his actions.</p>

          <p>Following direct pressure from the Trump administration, both Google and Apple have removed apps from their stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The move came after Attorney General Pam Bondi demanded Apple remove the 'ICEBlock' app, citing safety risks and arguing it puts law enforcement officers in danger. The controversy was heightened by reports that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had recently used such an app to track agents, prompting the tech companies to take action.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on an agricultural facility in Ukraine's Kharkiv region ignited a massive fire, resulting in the deaths of approximately 13,000 pigs and injuring one farm worker. Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack as an act of "deliberate terror" aimed at civilian infrastructure with no military purpose. This incident is part of a broader Russian assault on Ukraine's gas and energy facilities, which Moscow claims is targeting the country's military-industrial complex, while Kyiv insists it is meant to disrupt the upcoming heating season.</p>

          <p>A new review of Taylor Swift's 12th studio album, "The Life of a Showgirl," labels the project a "charmless chore" and suggests it is the product of creative burnout. The article contends that despite being produced by pop hitmaker Max Martin, the album lacks the passion and novelty of their past collaborations. The songwriting is described as resting on familiar themes but expressed in crasser terms, while the overall production feels "freeze-dried" and uninspired, failing to convey a sense of genuine joy or artistic progression for the superstar.</p>

The suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot and killed by police at the scene.

          <p>After being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for more than 100 days, journalist Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador. Guevara, who had been a reporter in the Atlanta area for two decades after fleeing El Salvador, was arrested on minor charges that were later dismissed while he was livestreaming a protest. His arrest prompted immigration officials to reopen a dormant deportation case against him. Press freedom organizations have widely condemned his detention and deportation as a threat to journalists' rights in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tactical analysis of Florian Wirtz's first nine appearances for Liverpool suggests his underwhelming start is not due to a lack of quality but rather his deployment in a sub-optimal role. The article argues that manager Arne Slot has asked Wirtz to drop deeper to help with build-up play, a physically demanding task that limits his opportunities in attacking positions where he excelled for Bayer Leverkusen. The increased intensity of the Premier League has also been a factor, though Wirtz's high running stats indicate a strong commitment to the team's system.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Bedouin community of Umm al-Khair in the occupied West Bank is facing intensified intimidation and land seizure by Israeli settlers from the adjacent illegal settlement of al-Karmil. The situation is exemplified by the actions of Yinon Levi, a sanctioned settler implicated in the recent murder of a villager, who continues to operate construction equipment to prepare land for new settler outposts. These actions, protected by the Israeli military, are effectively encircling the Palestinian village, threatening to sever community ties and displace residents.</p>

          <p>A growing body of data reveals that recent college graduates are facing a uniquely difficult job market, with the unemployment rate for "new entrants" to the workforce hitting a nine-year high. The historical advantage of holding a bachelor's degree has diminished, as the unemployment gap between college and high school graduates has shrunk to its narrowest point in decades. Many young graduates report applying for hundreds of positions without success, leading to financial strain, emotional distress, and a widespread feeling of being left behind in their careers.</p>

The case sets a significant precedent by being the first time paternity has been established in a UK court through the use of commercially available DNA databases. This legal victory now opens a path for the claimants, who often faced childhood bullying for being mixed-race, to apply for British citizenship and connect with their paternal families.</p>

          <p>In a poignant personal essay, the author recounts the sudden and overwhelming realization at age 55 that the possibility of having children has passed. She describes this finality as a "finite gusto of the wallop," triggering a mix of sadness for the maternal bond she will never experience and remorse for not having planned for a family sooner. The reflection delves into the complex emotions of mourning a future that will not happen, intertwined with the physical and emotional turbulence of menopause and memories of her own late mother.</p>

          <p>England head coach Thomas Tuchel has made a significant statement by excluding superstar Jude Bellingham from his latest squad, emphasizing that player selection will be based on current form rather than reputation. Despite Bellingham's desire to be included after recovering from surgery, Tuchel chose to reward the players who contributed to a recent dominant 5-0 win over Serbia. This decision signals a new approach where no player is guaranteed a spot, reinforcing the manager's philosophy that the team's strength should not depend on any single individual.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funds designated for major public transit projects in Chicago, including a critical extension of the Red Line subway system. The director of the Office of Management and Budget stated the hold was to ensure compliance with a new rule against "race-based contracting," a justification also used to freeze $18 billion for New York transit projects. Critics view the move as a political tactic to exert pressure on Democratic-led cities amid the ongoing partial federal government shutdown.</p>
