          <p>Twenty-nine people have been arrested in connection with the violence that recently erupted in Northern Ireland. The unrest began after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, County Antrim, and spread to other areas, resulting in injuries to 64 police officers. Detectives are investigating online posts related to the disorder, and several individuals have been charged with sending menacing messages and encouraging offenses. The violence has raised concerns among migrants, with some feeling unsafe and avoiding certain areas, highlighting the need to address anti-migrant sentiment and misinformation. The North West Migrants' Forum is calling for more support and awareness of migrants' contributions to society.</p>

          <p>Two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot in their homes in what Governor Tim Walz described as a "politically motivated assassination" attempt. State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured but survived. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, has been taken into custody and charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder.

          <p>At least 34 Palestinians were killed in new shootings near food distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern Gaza Strip. Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire to control crowds attempting to reach the aid hubs. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reported the fatalities, marking the deadliest incident yet in the near-daily shootings around the GHF centers. The GHF system, backed by Israel and the United States, aims to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, but it has faced criticism from U.N. agencies and major aid groups, who argue it is insufficient and allows Israel to use aid as a weapon.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The approval came with the condition that U.S. Steel and Nippon sign a national security agreement with the U.S. government, which they have now done. This agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions such as relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with the transaction expected to be completed promptly.</p>

          <p>Global investors appear to be underestimating the potential impact of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, as stock markets have largely sustained positive momentum despite ongoing warfare. Experts warn of the risk of a major escalation in the Middle East, particularly concerning the energy market. While energy markets have reacted most noticeably, with crude oil prices experiencing significant gains, they remain below levels seen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some strategists suggest that the market may be mistaking a lull in fighting for lasting peace and recommend buying into energy assets as a safe haven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests against overtourism are spreading across Europe, with demonstrators in Barcelona and Mallorca spraying tourists with water guns and holding signs demanding a reworking of the local economy. Residents claim that their cities are being handed over to tourists, leading to rising rents and the displacement of locals. Traditional stores are being replaced by tourist-oriented businesses, exacerbating the issue. While some governments are taking measures like ordering Airbnb to remove vacation rentals, Airbnb argues it is not responsible for overtourism.

          <p>WhatsApp is launching three new ad features in a global rollout across the messaging app. The new ads will not be shown in the same place as people's private chats, nor will the contents of their messages be used to decide which ads to display. Instead, WhatsApp will use the country, city, and language of the user, as well as their interaction with other ads and which channels they follow. People who have linked their WhatsApp account to Facebook or Instagram will see more personalized ads. These new features will appear in a section called Updates.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has insisted on pushing through plans to cut the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, despite potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The measures include making it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The current work capability assessment will be scrapped in 2028, and eligibility for Pip will be tightened, requiring claimants to prove they need a higher degree of assistance. The welfare package could push an extra 250,000 people into relative poverty.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the political debate surrounding energy efficiency standards for appliances in the United States. While energy efficiency has generally improved over the past half-century, recent administrations have taken differing approaches. The Biden administration pushed for stricter standards to save energy and money, while the Trump administration has rescinded dozens of energy-efficiency rules, arguing that consumer choice and market-driven innovation lead to better products. The appliance industry relies on federal government to streamline expectations, and there is debate over whether further tightening energy standards will harm performance.</p>

          <p>President Trump opposed a recent Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. U.S. officials stated that Trump conveyed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it was not a good idea. The conversation between Netanyahu and Trump occurred after Israel launched a massive attack on Iran last week. Netanyahu did not directly confirm or deny the reports when asked about it, and a spokesperson for Netanyahu later stated that the reports were false.</p>

          <p>Ongoing trade instability and turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East are set to dominate talks at the G7 summit in Canada. Allies are likely to question whether U.S. President Donald Trump stands with them or against them on major geopolitical points. Uncertainty arises from the White House's economic and foreign policy, including trade tariffs and a potential global trade war. Bilateral meetings between Trump and leaders seeking trade deals are expected to take place, but the odds of significant agreements are uncertain.</p>
