Tripadvisor's system relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions, categorized as boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews.

          <p>A former senior economic planner in China, Xu Lin, suggests that China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years, considering the likelihood of a protracted rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural problems. Xu, who previously helped draft Beijingâ€™s five-year plans, argues that a higher target is inappropriate given China's shrinking population, falling savings and production rates, and other domestic challenges. He emphasized that a 4% growth rate would be positive if it leads to expanded employment and controlled debt ratios.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed increasing frustration with Vladimir Putin, criticizing the Russian leader for escalating attacks on Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles. Trump stated that Putin "has gone absolutely CRAZY!" and is "needlessly killing a lot of people." He also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his public statements. The attacks, which resulted in casualties, have prompted Trump to consider further sanctions against Russia, marking a shift from his previous emphasis on a friendly relationship with Putin.</p>

          <p>Americans across the country commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, with gatherings in Houston, where he grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was killed. The murder of Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. On Sunday, Floyd's family gathered in Houston for a service led by Rev Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held several commemorations. Some observers note that the national "reckoning" with racism seems to be fading as President Trump begins to roll back police reforms.</p>
