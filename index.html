          <p>Friday's UK newspapers extensively covered the dismissal of Lord Mandelson, the former US ambassador, prompting significant scrutiny of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's judgment. Several outlets highlighted reports from security services about Mandelson's long-standing friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, which allegedly surfaced during his vetting process, though Downing Street has denied these claims. Conservative figures criticized the Prime Minister for appointing a candidate deemed unfit, while Mandelson's allies asserted his transparency regarding the Epstein relationship. His departure sparked headlines like "Home in disgrace," and discussions have begun about potential replacements for the crucial Washington post, including former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband.</p>

          <p>China has emerged as the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024, representing 16% of all investment in the three-province cluster. This significant backing includes plans for a light-rail line, an "aerotropolis," and potential property development, with only Thailand itself investing more. A Chinese consortium, including China Railway Construction Corporation, has also joined a Thai group to complete a 220km high-speed railway line through the corridor, a project expected to finish in five years after a pandemic-induced suspension. This substantial commitment underscores China's strategic economic engagement in Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>A controversial bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales is set for a two-day debate in the House of Lords, with opponents citing "massive problems" and supporters urging respect for the Commons' prior approval. Critics, including Baroness Luciana Berger, argue the legislation lacks proper scrutiny and clarity on practical implementation, tabling an amendment for further evidence gathering. However, Lord Falconer, championing the bill, emphasizes the elected Commons' decision should be respected, while acknowledging the Lords can refine the legislation. The bill proposes allowing terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, requiring approval from two doctors and a panel.</p>

Trump received a largely positive ovation from the crowd at Yankee Stadium and met with the team, where he praised star player Aaron Judge, who subsequently hit two home runs. Boone highlighted the deep emotional significance of the night for New York City and the team, underscoring the unique atmosphere created by the presidential presence during the solemn 9/11 commemoration.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a warning to Mexico, threatening countermeasures if the country proceeds with plans to raise tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50% from the current 20%. Beijing urged Mexico to "think twice," emphasizing the mutual importance of their trade relationship and the potential negative impact on economic cooperation. Mexico's proposed tariff hike, which requires Congressional approval, is part of a broader budget proposal affecting $52 billion in imports. China views such measures as a challenge to free trade, particularly amidst its ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., and has historically responded with restrictions on critical mineral exports.

          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five expert tips to help parents manage fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children. She advises allowing children autonomy in choosing what they eat and when to leave the table, as this can encourage them to try new foods and reduce mealtime battles. Stirling-Reed also stresses avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," instead modeling balance and variety, and prioritizing enjoyment at the dinner table. Engaging children in food preparation and exposing them to a wide range of quick, nutrient-dense foods are also recommended, along with consulting a GP for persistent concerns.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, members of Congress are significantly curtailing outdoor events and public appearances due to heightened anxiety over political violence. Several Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ruben Gallego, have postponed rallies and town halls, citing "an abundance of caution." Republican Rep. Nancy Mace announced she would not hold public events "anytime soon" and plans to carry a firearm when legally permitted. House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged the profound impact on colleagues, emphasizing the need for leaders to advocate their ideas peacefully, as lawmakers rethink security protocols for public engagements.</p>

          <p>A new immigration holding facility in West Texas, designed to house up to 5,000 immigrants in large white tents, has drawn criticism as a "giant tent city" from Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar. The facility, known as Camp East Montana, opened last month under a $1.24 billion contract awarded to Acquisition Logistics, a company with no prior public record of running such operations. Concerns have been raised about the detainees' conditions, including reports of inadequate food making people sick and a lack of information provided to them. Local officials, like El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, are seeking access and vigilance over the facility's operations.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," marks a departure from his recent introspective works, aiming to create joy and explore diverse cultures after a challenging personal period. The album subtly incorporates Asian and Middle Eastern musical elements, featuring instruments like the sitar and tabla, and a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh on the track "Sapphire." While Sheeran made efforts to authentically engage with these cultures, some critics note that the influences are often assimilated into his mainstream pop sound, rather than deeply integrated. Despite this, the article suggests "Play" is an enjoyable record that plays to his strengths, with "Sapphire" already topping India's streaming chart.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military strike on a vessel off Venezuela, which the Trump administration claimed was carrying drugs, is facing scrutiny as new information suggests the boat was heading back to shore when fired upon. National security officials reportedly disclosed this detail during a closed Capitol Hill briefing, raising questions about the strike's legality and the use of military force for law enforcement. Democratic senators, led by Sen. Tim Kaine, argue the administration lacks "legitimate legal justification" and that the armed forces are not empowered to kill suspected criminals without trial. The Trump administration defends the action as self-defense against drug cartels, but doubts persist regarding identification and evidence.</p>

Nasdaq's strategic $50 million investment in Gemini further bolstered institutional confidence, with plans to offer clients access to Gemini's custodial services. Despite widening losses reported in 2024 and 2025, the successful pricing indicates continued investor interest in crypto IPOs, even amid consolidation in major cryptocurrency prices.

The country also prioritized patient experience, with initiatives like colorful hospital environments and counselling centers. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledges these insights are informing government plans.
