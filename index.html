          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promoted two IRS agents, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, who had previously alleged political interference in their investigation of Hunter Biden.  The promotions follow the agents' whistleblowing to Congress and to CBS News, and contrast with President Trump's revocation of Hunter Biden's Secret Service protection.  Shapley and Ziegler will now advise on IRS reform.</p>
