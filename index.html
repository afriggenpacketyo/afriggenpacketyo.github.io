          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting strong investor demand. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop earlier in the year due to competition in China's EV market, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, demonstrating its continued dominance in the sector.</p>

Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, has been critical of the ICE facility, while McIver denies the charges against her, calling them "purely political."

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident where a Mexican navy ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. The ship, en route to Iceland, accelerated unexpectedly in reverse shortly after departing from a Manhattan pier, according to preliminary findings. Investigators are working with Mexican authorities to inspect the ship's engine and interview the remaining crew. The NTSB's initial report is expected within 30 days, and the agency is asking for any video footage from the public. The bridge has been declared safe following the accident.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China saw a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This is in contrast to market concerns about rising Treasury yields and Moodyâ€™s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects a broader trend of investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since the start of the trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar and China's economic recovery are contributing factors.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old Cal State Fullerton student, Simon Daniel, drowned during a fraternity trip to Lake Havasu after entering swift-moving waters in the Copper Canyon area. Recent rainfall had led to hazardous swimming conditions, including strong currents, crosswind and swells. Daniel was swept away by a wave while three fraternity brothers risked their lives attempting to rescue the six students. Rescue teams recovered his body the next morning, and a candlelit vigil was held in his memory. Both Cal State Fullerton and UC Santa Barbara are offering crisis counseling services to students.</p>

The investigation began in April 2024 when suspected illegal aliens entered a vehicle driven by Regalado, who led law enforcement on a chase, crashed into the Rio Grande, and swam to Mexico. In November 2024, another incident occurred involving Grajeda and Regalado, leading to another pursuit and the discovery of illegal aliens.</p>

LÃ³pez leads the anti-corruption and justice program for the human rights organization Cristosal and has been a critic of President Nayib Bukele. Cristosal says Lopez was arrested at her home late on Sunday evening by armed police and her whereabouts remain unknown, denouncing her arrest as "short-term enforced disappearance".

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in passing President Trumpâ€™s tax and budget legislation due to conflicting demands from various Republican factions. Conservatives are pressing for more spending cuts and the elimination of clean energy tax credits, while moderate Republicans from competitive districts are opposing Medicaid cuts. Republicans from high-tax states are seeking to lift the cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT). These divisions highlight the ideological, political, and regional interests within the GOP, making it difficult to secure enough votes for the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, as a quick solution to delays in the construction of new Air Force One jets. This arrangement has drawn condemnation from Democrats and Republicans, with ethics lawyers suggesting the Qataris are using the gift to curry favor with the administration. Despite Qatar's denial, the plan involves secret coordination and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane for presidential use. The process began with the White House Military Office and Boeing compiling a list of late-model 747s on the market.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are experiencing significant bleaching due to warming ocean temperatures. Marine scientist Greg Asner stated that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, causing the algae that give corals their vibrant hues to be pushed out. The rising heat is speeding up coral deaths, with it now taking weeks or even days to kill a reef, compared to years in the past. The decline is worse in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands, but the problem is most severe in the Caribbean and Florida. Efforts are underway to educate tourists and promote underwater nurseries to help corals recover.</p>
