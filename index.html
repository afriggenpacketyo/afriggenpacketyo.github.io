          <p>Spain is hosting a meeting of the "Madrid Group," bringing together European and Arab nations to explore ways to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares has called for an arms embargo against Israel and suggested targeted sanctions against individuals obstructing the two-state solution. Spain also plans to propose the suspension of the EU's trade partnership with Israel, currently under review. This initiative comes as international pressure mounts on Israel to de-escalate its military offensive against Hamas and address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A recent Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least seven children of a Palestinian doctor, with two more missing and presumed dead. The doctor's husband and another child were injured in the attack, which targeted a structure near Israeli forces. The Israeli military is investigating whether uninvolved civilians were harmed, while videos show emergency workers retrieving bodies from the site. This incident is part of an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hamas, contributing to the already high civilian toll in Gaza, with the conflict having killed over 50,000 people according to Gaza's Health Ministry.</p>

          <p>An article in a Chinese military magazine details a strategy for Beijing to subdue Taiwan by targeting its critical infrastructure, potentially leading to a "win without fighting."

Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, invited the royal couple. The King will deliver the "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament, emphasizing Canada's sovereignty and rejecting U.S. takeover claims. The visit is interpreted as a sign of solidarity with Canada, following Trump's suggestions that it should become the 51st U.S. state.</p>

The company employs a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews.

          <p>Aston Villa has filed a complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial decision to disallow a goal during their match at Old Trafford. The referee's decision to blow the whistle before the ball entered the goal prevented VAR from intervening. Villa captain John McGinn criticized the decision, while BBC pundits agreed that the referee made an error by deeming the goalkeeper to be in control of the ball. The club believes the decision had a significant impact on their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.</p>
