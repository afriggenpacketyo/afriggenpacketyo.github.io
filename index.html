        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case concerning the president's power to dismiss officials from independent agencies, a move that could overturn a nearly century-old legal precedent. This decision follows President Trump's firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, which the court has allowed to proceed pending the case. The central issue is the 1935 Humphrey's Executor ruling, which has historically shielded such agencies from direct political interference by limiting the president's removal powers. Dissenting justices warn that overturning this precedent could erase the intended bipartisanship and independence of these critical government bodies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the loose-knit political movement Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs federal agencies to investigate and disrupt any illegal activities and funding associated with the group. However, the legal and practical impact of this designation remains uncertain, as the U.S. lacks a specific domestic terrorism statute for charging individuals or groups. Legal experts note that Antifa is not a formally structured organization, which complicates the enforcement of such a directive and raises questions about its implementation.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has publicly predicted that his son, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, will get an opportunity to start for the Cleveland Browns at some point during the current NFL season. Despite Shedeur being third on the depth chart behind veterans Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, his father advised him to remain patient and prepared for his chance. Deion Sanders also confirmed that other teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles, showed interest in his son during the draft, but Shedeur was keen to avoid a long-term backup role.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a significant policy change for the H-1B visa program, requiring employers to pay a new $100,000 fee for each new application. This fee targets highly skilled foreign professionals, particularly in the tech and finance sectors, and is intended to encourage companies to prioritize hiring American workers. The White House clarified that the one-time fee applies only to new applicants in the upcoming lottery cycle, not to current visa holders or renewals. Exceptions can be made for employment deemed essential to the national interest by the Secretary of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>India is launching an ambitious $18.2 billion "Semiconductor Mission" to build a complete domestic chip supply chain, from design to manufacturing and packaging. The initiative aims to reduce reliance on imports and capture a larger share of the global electronics market as it shifts away from China. While the government has approved ten major projects, including fabrication plants with partners like Taiwan's Powerchip, experts caution that significant challenges remain. Overcoming fierce competition, developing a robust ecosystem, and strengthening infrastructure and intellectual property laws will be critical for India's success in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A group of U.S. citizens, supported by Representative Maxine Waters, has petitioned the United Nations to investigate federal immigration raids under the Trump administration, alleging they constitute a form of "ethnic cleansing" against Latinos. The petition, filed by civil rights attorney Luis Carrillo, calls for an independent probe into potential human rights abuses, including unlawful detentions and excessive force. It argues that domestic legal channels have failed to stop these practices. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the petition as inflammatory rhetoric that endangers law enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has claimed a link between the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, a position not supported by current scientific consensus. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a proponent of this theory, which aligns with his broader skepticism of established medical interventions. This move is part of a larger administration trend questioning the safety of proven medical treatments for pregnant women, including COVID vaccines and antidepressants. Medical experts emphasize that untreated pain and fever during pregnancy pose significant health risks to both mother and child.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas has created significant confusion and uncertainty for immigrant workers and their employers. While the White House has clarified the fee applies only to new applications, immigration lawyers are advising caution, particularly regarding travel for current visa holders who may need to file for extensions or employer changes. Attorneys express concern that the high cost will have a chilling effect on the program, which is crucial for staffing skilled positions in sectors like technology and healthcare. Questions also remain about the process for obtaining a national interest exemption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway called the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. Through an executive order, applicants can receive an employment-based visa by making an "unrestricted gift" of $1 million to the Department of Commerce. This program differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa by not requiring direct investment into American businesses. The administration suggests the funds will be used broadly to "promote commerce" and pay down national debt, effectively creating a pay-to-play system for U.S. residency.</p>

          <p>NHS England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, who died from cancer at age 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to take further action, such as ordering more tests or seeking a second opinion, to prevent avoidable deaths. This initiative aims to standardize best practices and improve early detection of serious illnesses, particularly in younger patients whose symptoms may be overlooked.</p>

          <p>China has started the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, which will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of Beijing's governance, aimed at achieving ambitious goals like reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions in October, the plan is expected to navigate significant domestic and international challenges. Experts suggest that while the plan will set key priorities, it will need to be flexible, prioritizing qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to adapt to turbulent times.</p>
