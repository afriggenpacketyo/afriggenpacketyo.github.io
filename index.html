        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the intensifying supply chain competition between the United States and China is poised to reshape global manufacturing. Eight developing countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Brazil, are expected to benefit from the relocation of manufacturing from China due to lower labor costs and strong trade ties with Western markets. This shift is driven by Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúfriendshoring‚Äù initiative and the ‚ÄúChina+1‚Äù strategy, prompting multinational corporations to diversify production to mitigate tariff exposure. Chinese firms are also exploring lower-cost regions, particularly within the Belt and Road Initiative, potentially establishing these eight economies as critical links in evolving global supply chains.

          <p>Istanbul's jailed mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent political rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court, facing charges of threatening and insulting a top judicial official.

Imamoglu, who has been detained since late March on separate corruption charges, faces over seven years in prison and a political ban if convicted. He denies all allegations, claiming the charges are politically motivated due to his plans to run against Erdogan in the 2028 presidential election.</p>

          <p>Israel has accused Iran of deliberately targeting civilians with missile strikes, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. This accusation comes amid escalating conflict, with Iran launching a wave of missiles at Israel, some of which evaded Israeli air defenses. Israel has responded with strikes on Iranian military targets, including missile launchers and facilities associated with the Quds Force. The fighting has led to the cancellation of planned talks on Iran's nuclear program between the U.S. and Iran, with the Israeli Defense Minister warning that Tehran's residents would "pay the price" for the attacks.</p>

          <p>As leaders of the world's largest advanced economic powers gather for the G7 summit in Canada, ongoing trade instability and turmoil in Ukraine and the Middle East are expected to dominate discussions. Uncertainty surrounding these issues largely stems from the White House's economic and foreign policies, prompting allies to question President Trump's alignment with them on major geopolitical matters. Trade talks are anticipated on the sidelines, but the likelihood of significant deals remains uncertain, with Canada abandoning the traditional communique to avoid disunity. Experts suggest that Trump's trade tariffs could hinder coordination among the G7 nations, who are striving to address global challenges.</p>

The doctor was convicted of killing two people and torturing nine others in a military hospital in Homs, Syria, displaying sadistic tendencies during the torture.

          <p>New guidelines at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals may allow doctors to refuse treatment to unmarried veterans and Democrats, following an executive order. The rules, which have already taken effect in some VA medical centers, eliminate language requiring healthcare professionals to care for veterans regardless of their politics and marital status. Medical experts have expressed concern that these changes could lead to discrimination against veterans based on personal characteristics not explicitly prohibited by federal law. The VA maintains that all eligible veterans will still receive the benefits and services they have earned.</p>

While California officials are working to bridge the gap with state funding, wildfire experts emphasize the need for adequate resources and personnel to safely conduct prescribed burns.

          <p>A large deployment of U.S. Air Force KC-135R and KC-46A tankers over the Atlantic has sparked speculation about potential changes in the U.S.'s involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. The mass migration of these refueling assets is unusual, especially given the ongoing crisis. Possible explanations include providing aerial refueling support to Israel, preparing for direct U.S. involvement in the air war, preparing to counter Iran's attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, or establishing a robust air bridge to the Middle East. This deployment underscores the volatile nature of the situation and the potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly relying on low-tech shotguns as a last resort against Russia's advanced fiber-optic drones that are resistant to jamming. The reliance on shotguns highlights the challenges of countering these drones, as electronic warfare methods are ineffective. Training schools are now teaching soldiers how to use shotguns to engage drones, recognizing the importance of this basic skill in modern warfare. While some express skepticism about the effectiveness of shotguns, many units are equipped with them as a standard protocol.</p>
