          <p>The Supreme Court's decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County curtails the role of environmental litigation, particularly concerning infrastructure development. The ruling favors government deference in environmental reviews, potentially streamlining project approvals but raising concerns about environmental protection. Critics argue the court's approach may reflect skepticism towards environmental regulation, suggesting a double standard where environmental harms are downplayed. The decision stems from a case involving an 88-mile rail line in Utah, highlighting the ongoing tension between infrastructure development and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's manager, Pep Guardiola, has identified Rayan Ait-Nouri as his top choice to address the team's left-back position. The club has been operating without a specialist left-back since Benjamin Mendy's departure. While no agreement is currently in place, sources indicate confidence that the transfer of the 23-year-old Algeria international will occur. Manchester City needs to finalize the transfer before June 10 for Ait-Nouri to be available for the Club World Cup group stage.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman has been charged with multiple felonies after allegedly attacking a crowd raising awareness for Israeli hostages in Gaza, injuring eight people. Soliman is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and shouting "Free Palestine" during the attack, which the FBI is treating as an "act of terrorism". The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained injuries ranging from minor to "very serious". Soliman is being held on a $10m bond and is due in court, with the attack heightening tensions amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>
