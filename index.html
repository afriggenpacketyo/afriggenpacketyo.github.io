          <p>Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" spending bill, despite being a close ally and previously working with the administration on cost-cutting measures. Musk believes the bill undermines efforts to reduce spending and will increase the budget deficit. He stated that a bill can be big or beautiful, but not both, and feels the bill goes against the work done by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) team. The legislation is projected to increase the deficit by approximately $600 billion in the next fiscal year, which has led to Musk's disappointment.</p>

          <p>Onosato, a 24-year-old sumo wrestler, has become the first Japanese competitor in seven years to achieve the top rank of yokozuna, or grand champion. Weighing 421 pounds, Onosato's promotion follows his victory at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, and he has pledged to devote himself to training and not disgrace the title. His achievement is particularly significant for Ishikawa prefecture, which was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami earlier in 2024, and Onosato aims to bring encouragement to the region. This promotion sets up a rivalry with Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, who also holds the yokozuna title.</p>

          <p>Starling Bank, a British online lender backed by Goldman Sachs, reported a 26% drop in annual profit, citing issues with Covid-era business loan fraud and a regulatory fine. The bank's profit before tax for the year ending March 31, 2025, was Â£223.4 million, down from Â£301.9 million the previous year, despite a 5% increase in revenue. Profits were impacted by a Â£29 million fine from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority for failings in financial crime prevention systems. Starling also flagged an issue with the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, where the government guaranteed loans to firms during the pandemic.</p>

There is an 80% chance of a new annual temperature record and a high probability that the world will exceed the international temperature threshold set a decade ago. For the first time, there is a slight chance the world's annual temperature will surpass the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, potentially reaching 2 degrees Celsius before the end of the decade.

He also criticized the Steelers' handling of Kenny Pickett, the quarterback they drafted in 2022, stating they failed to provide him with adequate protection and weapons. Bradshaw emphasized that the Steelers' failures, not Pickett's, were the reason for his struggles, highlighting the lack of an effective offensive line and wide receivers.</p>

He argued that both the Fever and the WNBA gave credibility to a troll and created something out of nothing, causing Caitlin Clark to defend her fans for no reason.

          <p>The government is reviewing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements to make it easier to build homes on smaller sites, potentially easing environmental rules for developers in England. These rules currently require developers to compensate for any loss of nature on housing developments, and the government is considering how to reduce costs for smaller housebuilders while still delivering habitats for wildlife. The proposals, part of a package of housing reforms, include easing BNG requirements for minor developments and giving planning officers more power to approve them.

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to temporarily halt scheduling visa interviews for international students as it prepares to implement social media monitoring for these applicants. This directive, which could significantly delay visa processing and impact universities financially, is part of a broader effort to tighten vetting policies, particularly for students involved in pro-Palestinian protests. All student visa applications will now have their social media examined for evidence of support for "terrorist activity or a terrorist organization." The administration also plans to cut ties with Harvard University, potentially resulting in the loss of $100 million in contracts.</p>

          <p>Savannah Chrisley has expressed her joy and disbelief after President Donald Trump pardoned her parents, Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were imprisoned for tax evasion and bank fraud. She shared that Trump personally called her to deliver the news, and she remains "eternally grateful" for his decision, emphasizing that her parents now have a "fresh start." Savannah previously appealed to the Trump administration for her parents' pardons and spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention. The Chrisleys were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison for charges stemming from fraudulent activities dating back to 2007.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to lift restrictions imposed by a federal judge on deportations to third countries. The administration argues that these restrictions, which require providing detainees with notice of their destination and time to raise safety concerns, have created a "diplomatic and logistical morass." Judge Murphy's order was issued after detainees slated for deportation to South Sudan sued over alleged inability to raise fears of torture. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on US soil must be afforded "due process of law," though the specifics remain contested.</p>

          <p>With "Maycember"â€”the confluence of high costs associated with end-of-school-year activitiesâ€”now ending, financial experts recommend strategies for recovery. The first step is reviewing spending and reassessing financial plans to regain control. For those who have accumulated credit card debt, prioritizing repayment through methods like the avalanche or snowball strategy is recommended. Automating savings by setting up recurring transfers to emergency funds or savings accounts is another key strategy. Additionally, scaling back on discretionary spending, finding free events, and exploring side gigs can help turbocharge debt repayment.</p>

          <p>The socialist left often attributes the rise of right-wing populism to the center-left's betrayal of the working class through neoliberal policies. However, this analysis often overlooks the role of ideas, values, and identities in shaping political behavior, instead focusing on material interests. A more accurate explanation focuses on the ideological shift in global politics, where an egalitarian vision of democracy has challenged traditional hierarchies, leading to the rise of far-right parties championing those unsettled by these changes. Adopting a postmaterial analytic framework, which acknowledges the importance of ideas and identities, is essential for the left to understand and counter the far right's power.</p>
