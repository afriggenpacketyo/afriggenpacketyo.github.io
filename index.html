          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products. The denim company announced it plans to absorb some of the initial costs from higher U.S. tariffs on goods from key manufacturing regions, though this strategy may change depending on evolving trade policies. Despite the tariff headwinds, the company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong direct-to-consumer sales and growth in its women's apparel and tops categories. The positive report caused the company's shares to rise significantly in extended trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kim Jones, the mother of a former Yale swimmer who competed against Lia Thomas, describes the emotional distress that motivated her to co-found the Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS). Jones recounts feeling helpless and silenced after witnessing Thomas compete, which spurred her to connect with other advocates like former swimmer Marshi Smith. The organization now provides financial support for legal challenges, including a lawsuit led by Riley Gaines against the NCAA. The article details the group's efforts to fund lawsuits aimed at preventing transgender athletes from competing in women's sports categories.</p>

          <p>An NPR report provides a firsthand account from Gazan journalist Anas Baba about the dangerous and difficult journey to obtain food amid the ongoing war and Israeli restrictions. Baba, who has lost a third of his body weight, describes his attempt to reach a new food distribution site run by private American contractors under Israeli military protection. The article highlights the severe humanitarian crisis, noting that the UN has criticized this new aid system as ineffective. It also mentions that hundreds of people have reportedly been killed by Israeli troops while trying to access these food sites.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and was later returned to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges. A judge had ordered his release, but the Justice Department indicated ICE would then seek to remove him to a third country.

          <p>After a period of steady decline, interest rates for home equity loans and HELOCs have flattened, with average rates for both products now sitting just above 8%. While this pause may deter some immediate borrowing, this article suggests homeowners can use this time strategically. Prospective borrowers are advised to check their credit reports, work on improving their credit scores, and shop around for lenders with the most competitive current offers. This preparation can position them to act quickly and secure better terms when rates eventually begin to fall again. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration is betting that its policies will foster a booming economy, which will be a central message for the upcoming elections.
