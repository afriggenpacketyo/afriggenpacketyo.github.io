          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been dive-bombing residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been taken in by a local falconer. The hawk, which had attacked approximately 50 people, causing injuries in some cases, was captured and trained by Wayne Housden, who spent around £1,000 building an aviary for the bird. Housden believes the hawk was likely a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and intends to keep it full-time, with plans to eventually let it fly loose. The falconer also plans to bring the hawk to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August.</p>

Regulatory changes, such as the closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods, have further complicated Shein's listing ambitions.

          <p>Glaciers worldwide are melting at an accelerated rate, impacting water supplies, ecosystems, and infrastructure, as highlighted by the collapse of the Birch Glacier in Switzerland. This melting is causing both water shortages in some regions and increased risk of flooding in others, affecting communities that rely on glacial melt for their daily water needs. Infrastructure is also threatened by glacial lake outbursts, as seen in Pakistan and India, where floods have caused significant damage and loss of life. The loss of glaciers also endangers cultural traditions and winter sports industries, necessitating adaptation measures and global efforts to slow rising temperatures.</p>

He calls on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to disavow statements made by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who suggested encouraging Gazans to relocate elsewhere.

          <p>A New York court ruling against blanket tariffs imposed by President Trump has limited impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, as it does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are significant UK exports. While the UK has secured a deal with the US to reduce tariffs on cars to 10% and eliminate them on steel and aluminum, this agreement has not yet been implemented. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of 10% tariffs on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, creating uncertainty about that aspect of the deal. The White House intends to appeal the decision, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest confidently.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals, aiming to incentivize their restoration and protection. Working with researchers, WWF has installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that these plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. The UK has lost approximately 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many being drained for agriculture.</p>

Three opposition parties have submitted separate bills, but their passage is uncertain due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which fears it could harm family cohesion. Currently, Japanese law requires married couples to share a single family name, typically the husband's. Public support for a dual family-name system is growing, with a recent poll showing 71% in favor, yet the LDP has not reached a consensus on the issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America," following a court ruling against his tariffs. Trump blamed the Federalist Society, which Leo once led, for giving him bad advice on judicial nominations. This attack comes after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, deemed most of his tariffs illegal, putting Trump at odds with some conservative legal circles. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts, stating it would be his most important legacy.</p>

This agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and may take a few months to implement, as the registration process must be completed and products must pass radiation checks.

The festival has also faced challenges such as extreme flooding in 2005 and controversies like the hip-hop headliner in 2008.

Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, warns that while a full-scale financial war remains unlikely, the US might gradually expand sanctions against specific Chinese entities, potentially leading to China's exclusion from the US dollar system. He argues that imposing full-blown sanctions, such as cutting China off from the Swift system, would significantly damage the system itself, given China's prominence in global trade and investment. Should China be excluded from Swift, countries may shift to China's alternative, CIPS, undermining Swift's importance. (not investment advice)</p>
