          <p>Two four-year-old bears named Mish and Lucy escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in southwestern England. The bears made their way to the food storage area and consumed a week's worth of honey and other snacks. As a precaution, visitors were escorted to a secure building during the hour-long incident, but the bears were monitored via CCTV and ground staff. The park stated that the bears posed no threat to the public and were successfully returned to their enclosure by keepers before promptly falling asleep due to their honey feast.</p>

          <p>NATO allies have agreed to raise their defense spending target from 2% to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035. The decision was made amidst ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the war between Ukraine and Russia. The new target includes at least 3.5% of GDP for pure defense spending, with the remainder allocated to security and defense-related critical infrastructure. Member states will submit annual plans demonstrating their progress toward achieving this goal, addressing previous concerns about meeting the 2% target set in 2014.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, declined to provide a clear commitment to Article 5, the collective defense agreement among NATO countries. Trump claimed there are "numerous definitions" of Article 5 and instead emphasized his commitment to being friends with and helping the leaders of NATO nations. He promised to provide a more precise definition later but stressed his dedication to saving lives and ensuring safety, deferring a full explanation until he arrived at the summit.</p>

          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The decline is attributed to a shift in customer preference towards cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Tesla's market share in Europe also decreased from 1.8% to 1.2% compared to May 2024. The article notes that Tesla faces increasing competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese companies, such as BYD, which registered nearly as many vehicles as Tesla in May.</p>

The Meta data center will create 500 permanent jobs and use twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day.

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Iran were marked by rapid developments and real-time narration on social media. Iran retaliated against the U.S. by firing missiles at a U.S. military base in Qatar, which were intercepted, leading Trump to announce a ceasefire agreement. However, reports of continued exchanges of fire emerged, causing Trump to express frustration with both nations. Despite the initial violations, a fragile ceasefire appeared to be holding, following Trump's direct intervention and communication with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Psychologists are raising concerns about the potential for ChatGPT to worsen symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to its ability to reinforce reassurance-seeking behaviors. People with OCD may compulsively seek answers from ChatGPT, leading to a cycle of anxiety and temporary relief, which ultimately exacerbates the disorder. Experts recommend that people with OCD avoid using AI chatbots for reassurance and instead focus on accepting uncertainty. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, acknowledges that the chatbot can foster problematic behavior patterns and is working to reduce ways it might unintentionally reinforce negative behavior.</p>

The ceasefire, brokered by the Trump administration, led to the lifting of restrictions in Israel, including the reopening of Ben Gurion International Airport. While Israeli officials claim significant setbacks to Iran's nuclear capabilities, initial intelligence assessments suggest a more limited impact. Meanwhile, Iran has threatened to accelerate its enrichment work without IAEA oversight, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the situation.</p>

          <p>Pauline Shanks Kaurin, the James B. Stockdale Chair in Professional Military Ethics at the Naval War College, has resigned in protest over what she describes as political interference from President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. She believes that remaining in her position would implicitly endorse policies she cannot support, and that the type of teaching and research she was hired to do is no longer possible. Kaurin's resignation is part of a broader trend of academics leaving military institutions due to concerns about academic freedom and political influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but not before accusing both sides of violating the agreement. Israel accused Iran of breaching the ceasefire minutes after it was intended to take effect, prompting a response. Despite the initial violations, the ceasefire appeared to be holding after Trump intervened, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The State Department announced the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, signaling a return to normalcy following the conflict.</p>

The return aligns with a shift back towards thinness and diet culture, with wraps being marketed for their protein content and lower calorie counts.

Intelligence agencies are using various methods, including satellite imagery, seismic detectors, and informers, to develop a clearer picture of the damage. However, even significant damage to sites like Fordo does not necessarily mean the end of Iran's overall program, as it could be reconstituted at new sites.</p>

A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine estimates that these coverage losses could lead to thousands of additional deaths annually.

          <p>A cargo ship carrying approximately 3,000 new vehicles sank in the North Pacific Ocean off Alaska's Aleutian Islands, weeks after crew members abandoned ship due to an uncontrollable fire. The Morning Midas sank in international waters, with the U.S. Coast Guard monitoring for any pollution. The ship was loaded with about 3,000 new vehicles intended for a major Pacific port in Mexico, including electric and hybrid vehicles. The sinking occurred after fire damage, compounded by bad weather and water seepage.</p>

          <h2>Thailand May Reclassify Cannabis as a Narcotic, Reversing Legalization</h2>

          <p>Thailand is on the verge of reclassifying cannabis as a narcotic, potentially reversing its 2022 decision to decriminalize recreational use. This policy reversal could collapse a $1 billion industry and shut down thousands of cannabis shops. The decision comes after a government coalition split and concerns about the unregulated market, particularly its impact on young people. The health ministry has issued an order banning recreational cannabis sales, requiring a doctor's prescription for legal purchases.</p>
