          <p>This New York Times article explores the emerging debate within the Democratic Party, particularly in California, regarding the implementation of mandatory retirement ages for elected officials. Prompted by concerns over leaders holding onto power past their prime, some activists are pushing for age limits at the state and local levels, although the proposal faces resistance due to concerns about ageism and discrimination against experienced individuals. The discussion is fueled by regrets over instances like Dianne Feinstein's declining health while in office and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision not to retire, as well as concerns about President Biden's age. The article also notes that Americans generally support age limits for elected officials.</p>

          <p>This BBC article discusses Mark Carney's recent election as Prime Minister of Canada and his plans to address the trade war and sovereignty issues caused by President Donald Trump. Carney's campaign focused on standing up to Trump's policies, which resonated with voters concerned about Canada's independence and economic stability. The election result was unexpected, as the Liberal Party had been trailing significantly in the polls before Carney's leadership. His strategy involves uniting Canadians, promoting domestic buying, and using economic expertise to navigate the challenges posed by Trump's administration.</p>

Harris suggests that the dynamics within a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to elect a new Pope, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying hidden traitors. He argues that the secretive and focused nature of the conclave is a "brilliant device" for choosing the right leader, a process from which UK political parties could learn. Harris also touches on the exclusion of women from the priesthood and papal elections, calling it an oddity in modern religion.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports that Uber is now allowing passengers to pay in cash across most of the UK, excluding London, following successful trials in several cities. The move aims to make Uber accessible to those who prefer cash or lack bank cards, but individual drivers can opt out of accepting cash for safety reasons. This decision comes as a major report suggests shops and services may need to be forced to accept cash to protect those who rely on it. Uber's move aligns its operations with many other countries where cash payments are common.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Guardian reports that a federal appeals court has blocked a plan to reinstate over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) workers after an earlier ruling granted a temporary stay on Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order dismantling the US taxpayer-funded news service for overseas listeners. The court's decision defers to the executive branch on employment matters, making it unlikely that broadcasters will return to work until the case is resolved. This ruling impacts the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees VoA and distributes funds to broadcasters providing news in countries with limited independent media.</p>

          <p>This BBC article discusses how Europe is marking VE Day with concerns about President Trump's policies and their impact on transatlantic relations. Trump's apparent respect for Putin and threats to traditionally close allies have shocked many Europeans, who view the U.S. as their closest friend since World War II. The article explores the historical context of the transatlantic alliance and how it is now being tested by Trump's approach, which has led to increased defense spending in Europe and a growing sense that the U.S. is less committed to the relationship.</p>

          <p>This BBC article by Sir John Curtice analyzes the Reform Party's strong performance in recent local council elections, noting that their success is more than just a protest vote. The party's support is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and Boris Johnson in 2019, particularly in working-class areas with fewer university graduates. The article highlights that Reform's appeal poses a challenge to both the Conservative and Labour parties, as they need to address the concerns of this segment of the population to recover from recent losses.</p>
