          <p>An opinion article from the South China Morning Post asserts that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant economic and social revival, marked by the return of tourists and major international business events. The author points to a booming IPO market and unique events like a Bitcoin conference as signs of the city's distinct capitalist identity within China. To secure its future, the piece argues that Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub, leveraging its unique status amidst US-China tensions.

          <p>Much of coastal California is experiencing unseasonably cool weather, with temperatures dropping 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. While Los Angeles residents may welcome the relief from recent heat waves, the chilly breezes and thick fog are a disappointment for the Bay Area, which already endured its coldest summer in decades. Meteorologists attribute the unusual conditions to an upper-level low-pressure system from the Pacific. While some inland areas continue to see warm, monsoonal conditions, the coastal regions are not expected to see a significant warm-up until at least the weekend.</p>

          <p>Germany's national football team recovered from a recent loss to secure a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying match in Cologne. After an early goal, Germany's performance faltered, allowing Northern Ireland to equalize before halftime. However, key substitutions by coach Julian Nagelsmann, particularly the introduction of Nadiem Amiri, changed the game's tempo and led to the win. A standout free-kick goal from Florian Wirtz sealed the victory, providing a crucial three points as the team continues its challenging campaign to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Sky-gazers across the globe have been treated to the astronomical spectacle of a total lunar eclipse, popularly known as a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon occurs when the Moon passes directly through the Earth's shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a distinct reddish hue. This striking visual effect is the result of sunlight being filtered and refracted through Earth's atmosphere. The full eclipse was visible in its totality from numerous countries, captivating viewers and photographers who shared images of the celestial event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly rejected the idea that the Trump administration's trade tariffs function as a tax on American consumers, despite concerns from major companies and a recent federal court ruling against the policy. In a television interview, Bessent dismissed corporate warnings as worst-case scenarios and expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would ultimately uphold the tariffs. His comments come as newly released data shows a loss of 42,000 manufacturing jobs since the tariffs were announced, a figure Bessent attributed to the time it takes for factories to be built.</p>

At a prominent Black church on the West Side, congregants were advised to carry identification and stay in communication with family, while leaders called for investment in community resources rather than a military presence.

          <p>At 21 years old, English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, a milestone that has intensified discussions about his role in the upcoming Ashes series. Despite being highly rated and already having played for England, the lack of a century was a notable gap in his burgeoning career. While some pundits believe his aggressive, white-ball style is well-suited for Australian pitches, others argue he needs more experience in long-form, red-ball cricket to be a guaranteed success in the Test format. The performance puts pressure on England's selectors.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill, a significant piece of legislation intended to ban zero-hours contracts and enhance protections against unfair dismissal. Union leaders have grown concerned that a recent cabinet reshuffle, including the departure of key proponent Angela Rayner, signals a weakening of the government's commitment to the bill. While unions are preparing to campaign fiercely against any changes, business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses see the reshuffle as an opportunity to amend the legislation they find concerning.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and outspoken liberal force who shaped California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his pro-labor stance and colorful, expletive-laden candor, Burton served in the Assembly, Congress, and as the powerful leader of the state Senate. Alongside his brother, Rep. Phillip Burton, and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, he was a key architect of the political machine that dominated Democratic politics in the state. He championed causes for the underprivileged, including foster youth, and was instrumental in the Democratic Party's consolidation of power in California.</p>

In an interview, Zelenskyy argued that the Russian leader's primary goal was to secure a high-profile meeting with his U.S. counterpart to project strength, and that this was achieved without any benefit for Ukraine. His comments came just before Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine, striking Kyiv. Zelenskyy reiterated his call for more pressure from Western allies, including stopping the purchase of Russian energy, to compel an end to the war.</p>

          <p>International postal traffic to the United States has dropped by more than 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end the "de minimis" trade exemption, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The rule had previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country tariff-free. The administration defended the move as a necessary step to combat counterfeit goods and fentanyl trafficking. However, the sudden change has caused a near-halt in mail flow, with at least 88 postal operators suspending some services to the U.S. until a new technical solution for compliance is developed.

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that President Trump is transforming the failed metaphor of a "war on drugs" into a dangerous new reality by authorizing military force against alleged traffickers. The piece condemns a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 people on a boat in the Caribbean, labeling it an extrajudicial killing that sets a dangerous precedent for unilateral military action without oversight. The article contends that such summary executions are not only morally wrong and counterproductive to intelligence gathering but also risk inflaming tensions with partner nations, ultimately undermining efforts to combat both drug trafficking and migration.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently soared to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis reveals significant state-by-state differences in lottery spending. Residents of Massachusetts lead the nation, spending an average of $915 per year on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually. According to the analysis, this disparity may be linked to accessibility, with more urbanized states offering greater opportunities to purchase tickets. Lottery sales represent a notable source of state revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of a state's general fund.</p>
