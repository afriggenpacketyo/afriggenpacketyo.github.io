        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has concluded its most expensive transfer window in history, spending £415 million on new players, including a British record £125 million for striker Alexander Isak. This significant shift in transfer policy was driven by a combination of factors, including accumulated funds from previous frugal windows, substantial commercial growth, and player sales exceeding £200 million. The club's recent Premier League title win under manager Arne Slot also created an opportune moment to invest heavily and strengthen the squad, although the tragic death of Diogo Jota necessitated unplanned changes in their forward line.</p>

          <p>Global food company Nestlé has terminated its chief executive, Laurent Freixe, after just one year in the role due to an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate. The dismissal was immediate and followed an investigation initiated by a whistleblower report, which found the relationship constituted a conflict of interest and violated company policy. The Swiss-based firm, known for brands like Kit Kat and Nespresso, stated that Freixe will not receive an exit package. Philipp Navratil, a long-serving executive, has been appointed as his successor.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political and economic alliance including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. This initiative aims to provide member nations with an alternative financial system to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade and insulate them from associated risks. Analysts suggest the bank would also accelerate key infrastructure projects within the 10 member countries. The move is seen as a logical step to strengthen economic cooperation and financial sovereignty among the participating nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of attempting to orchestrate a regime change through military intimidation, citing a recent naval buildup in the Caribbean. While the Trump administration states the deployment is to counter drug cartel activities, Maduro claims it is an interventionist threat, describing it as the most significant danger the continent has faced in a century. He asserted that Venezuela is "super-prepared" and will not yield to what he perceives as a direct threat to his country's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The announcement comes shortly after the 81-year-old former New York City mayor was seriously injured in a car crash in New Hampshire. Trump praised Giuliani as a "great American Patriot," while the decision has drawn attention to Giuliani's controversial legacy, which includes his leadership after 9/11 as well as his subsequent disbarment and criminal charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare viewing opportunity, extending further south than usual, is due to heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, the phenomenon could offer a memorable display for many. The best chances for sightings are predicted for Monday and Tuesday nights, particularly in areas with less cloud cover like the Midlands.</p>

They argue that these moves, along with replacing expert advisors with vaccine skeptics, leave the nation vulnerable to future health crises and are calling for congressional oversight.</p>

          <p>The recent transfers of Alexander Isak to Liverpool and Yoane Wissa to Newcastle, both of whom refused to train to force their moves, have sparked a debate about player power in football. While some commentators have labeled the players' actions "despicable," others argue that clubs often act with similar self-interest, making their criticism hypocritical. The success of these tactics contrasts with the case of Marc Guehi, whose professional conduct did not result in his desired move to Liverpool. This raises questions about whether forcing a transfer is becoming a more effective, albeit controversial, strategy for players.</p>

As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record, the primary challenge is whether his aging body can withstand the strain of consecutive best-of-five-set matches.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine, his administration has refrained from implementing severe new sanctions. Analysts suggest this hesitation stems from two key strategic concerns: a desire to be seen as a peace-broker and a fear of pushing Russia into a deeper alliance with China. Further isolating Russia could grant China greater access to energy resources, military technology, and Arctic territories, strengthening Beijing's global position. This cautious approach has left Ukrainian officials disappointed, as they had hoped for stronger U.S. pressure to compel Putin toward a ceasefire. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The drama explores a crisis point in Kerr's life in the late 1990s, as he grappled with substance abuse and relationship anxieties after suffering his first professional loss. Johnson's performance is noted as the only conceivable casting for the role, though the film is seen as a solid but not groundbreaking drama primarily for UFC fans. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn, providing a witty and sympathetic performance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly urged pharmaceutical companies to "justify the success" of their COVID-19 drugs and release more data to the public. His comments, made on Truth Social, come amid leadership turmoil at the CDC and a recent FDA decision to limit the approval of new vaccines to high-risk individuals. Trump referenced the ongoing debate over vaccine effectiveness, mentioning the work of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the upheaval at the CDC, and called on drug companies to provide answers to "clear up this MESS."</p>

          <h2>Federal Data Shows 1.2 Million Decline in Immigrant Workers During Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis of federal data, the number of immigrant workers in the U.S. workforce has decreased by 1.2 million in the first seven months of the year under the Trump administration. This decline, which includes both legal and undocumented workers, is attributed to stricter immigration policies, increased deportations, and a slowdown in border crossings. Economists express concern that this trend could create labor shortages, particularly in sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which are heavily reliant on immigrant labor. The reduction in workers could also complicate the Federal Reserve's understanding of the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has temporarily suspended new applications for its refugee family reunion scheme, which previously allowed refugees to bring family members to the country without conditions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the pause is necessary to align the rules with those for other migrants, which typically require income and accommodation standards to be met. The government argues the old rules, designed for past conflicts, are now out of step and have contributed to homelessness among refugee families. The move comes amid ongoing political pressure regarding immigration and asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has reported that an aircraft carrying its president, Ursula von der Leyen, experienced GPS jamming from suspected Russian interference as it prepared to land in Bulgaria. While the plane landed safely, the incident has heightened concerns about Russia's hostile actions and their potential threat to aviation safety. In response, the EU plans to deploy additional satellites to better detect such interference. This event is part of a growing number of GPS jamming and spoofing incidents reported by airlines, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Baltic region.</p>
