          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla, formerly a hurricane, is weakening off Mexico's Pacific coast but is expected to bring significant rainfall and potential flash flooding to the U.S. Southwest. Forecasters predict 2 to 4 inches of rain across parts of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado through Saturday. While the storm's core will remain offshore, large swells are causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Baja California peninsula and Mexico's coast.</p>

          <p>According to data from Senator Mark Warner's office, a substantial number of FBI agents have been redirected from their regular duties to support immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. The shift has reportedly pulled agents away from investigating cybercrimes, terrorism, and violent crimes, raising concerns about national security risks. Critics and former agents worry this unprecedented reorganization could compromise the FBI's core missions and lead to low morale within the bureau.</p>

          <p>During a lengthy cabinet meeting, President Trump celebrated the newly brokered Israel-Hamas peace deal, which he framed as a move toward "everlasting peace." The timing of the announcement, just before the Nobel Peace Prize winner is named, fueled speculation about the president's aspirations for the award. Secretary of State Marco Rubio heavily praised the president's personal role, stating no other leader could have achieved the breakthrough, in what was interpreted as a heavy hint to the Nobel committee.</p>

          <p>During a hearing for a lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago to block the federal deployment of the National Guard, a federal judge intensely questioned the government's legal authority and the scope of the troops' mission. Judge April M. Perry expressed concern over the open-ended nature of the president's order and pressed for clarity on whether the Guard would be limited to protecting federal property or engaging in broader crime-fighting. The state argued the deployment is an unconstitutional use of military force.</p>

          <p>The recent Israel-Hamas agreement was reportedly achieved through a combination of President Trump's unique diplomatic style and evolving regional dynamics. Key factors included Trump's ability to exert significant private pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, his strong relationships with Gulf state leaders, and a strategic alignment with a European-Arab peace initiative. An Israeli strike in Qatar that angered allies served as a critical turning point, galvanizing the administration to secure a deal that had eluded previous efforts.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Gaza Deal Marks a Major Achievement but Creates New U.S. Responsibilities</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's Israel-Hamas peace plan is a significant diplomatic success, it also commits the U.S. to a deep and complex role in the region's future. The author suggests that by brokering the deal, the administration now "owns" the responsibility for its implementation, which involves daunting challenges like disarming Hamas and overseeing Gaza's reconstruction. The success of this long-term commitment will be a major test of the "America First" foreign policy approach.</p>

          <p>The first phase of the Trump-brokered Israel-Hamas deal involves a multi-step process beginning with an Israeli cabinet vote and a ceasefire. This will be followed by the release of living hostages by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli troop pullback. Subsequent phases of the 20-point plan, which require further negotiation, address the long-term governance of Gaza by a technocratic committee, the disarmament of Hamas, and the deployment of an international stabilization force.</p>

          <p>In his first solo directing project, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the career and personal struggles of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film focuses on the challenging period when Kerr, once an unbeatable champion, battled a painkiller addiction and began to lose, offering an uncomfortable portrait of vulnerability. Safdie's aim was to humanize a seemingly invincible figure by examining the emotional toll of his decline, a narrative that attracted Johnson.</p>

          <h2>Trump Threatens to Use Government Shutdown to Cut Programs Favored by Democrats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 15:54:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated his administration intends to leverage the current government shutdown to make permanent cuts to federal programs that are popular with Democrats. During a Cabinet meeting, he claimed Democrats were to blame for the shutdown and would "get a little taste of their own medicine." This threat follows earlier actions by the administration to freeze billions in funding for infrastructure and climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states, escalating the political stakes of the funding stalemate.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has returned two larger groups of migrants to France as part of a bilateral "one in, one out" agreement, signaling an escalation of the program. The deal allows the UK to send back individuals who arrived illegally in exchange for accepting vetted asylum seekers from France. While the government hopes the scheme will deter dangerous Channel crossings, the recent returns occurred as over a thousand migrants made the journey in a single day, highlighting the ongoing challenge.</p>
