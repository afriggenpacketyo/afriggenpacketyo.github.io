        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poundland, a major UK budget retail chain with approximately 14,700 staff and 800 stores, faces a critical financial situation, potentially running out of money by next week without High Court approval of a restructuring plan. The company, which reported a £35.7m pre-tax loss, was sold for £1 in June and plans to close 68 shops and its online operations, risking 1,000 jobs. The proposed turnaround involves a significant £90m cash injection from its new private equity owner and a three-year deferral of £276.5m in loans. This urgent restructuring aims to prevent administration amidst a challenging retail and economic environment, with many stores operating at unprofitable rent levels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many surprising food sources can help individuals meet their daily calcium requirements, which are crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Registered dietitians highlight that beyond traditional dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, options include calcium-fortified non-dairy milks, tofu made with calcium, and fortified fruit juices and cereals. Canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, also provide calcium, as do vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy. Experts recommend consulting a doctor about supplements if concerns about calcium levels persist, emphasizing that natural food sources should be prioritized.</p>

          <p>Sixty-five years after gaining independence, many francophone African nations reflect on their progress, with some still ranking among the world's poorest due to factors like infertile land, limited raw material wealth, high birthrates, and political instability. While French political influence wanes, with troops expelled from several nations, economic ties remain strong, notably through the CFA franc currency, which offers stability but limits monetary autonomy. Despite challenges, the region has seen a decline in extreme poverty, increased life expectancy, and reduced infant mortality, with remittances from the diaspora playing a crucial role in supporting rural populations.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has downplayed the emotional significance of his upcoming Week 1 game against his former team, the New York Jets. Rodgers, who spent two years with the Jets before joining the Steelers, stated that while he has friendships there, it's just one game out of 17. He expressed regret that his tenure with the Jets, marred by an Achilles injury in 2023, didn't work out as hoped, but he remains thankful for the special moments. The Jets will start Justin Fields, who previously backed up Russell Wilson for the Steelers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Pentagon Considers Equity Stakes in Major Defense Contractors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 10:20:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top Pentagon officials under the Trump administration are reportedly considering acquiring equity stakes in leading defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This discussion follows the U.S. government's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel. Lutnick suggested that Lockheed, which largely relies on federal contracts, functions "basically an arm of the U.S. government," and indicated a potential overhaul of how the Pentagon finances defense capabilities.

          <p>President Trump announced he has fired Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, a move Cook and her attorney assert is unlawful. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, was appointed in 2022 for a term running until 2038, and federal law requires "cause" for a president to remove a Fed governor. Trump's action follows months of public attacks against the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell, over interest rate policies. Cook has vowed to contest the firing, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over presidential power and the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer believes England may lack the "killer instinct" required to win the Ashes series in Australia this winter. Despite thrilling 2-2 draws against India and in the last home Ashes series, Langer questions England's ability to close out a series, particularly on Australian soil where they have a poor recent record. He suggests England must adopt an aggressive "Bazball" approach to put pressure on Australia's formidable bowling attack. The series, starting November 21 in Perth, will test England's courage against world-class bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins.</p>

He has also scrutinized the mortgage records of other Democratic adversaries, including Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, recommending their prosecution. Pulte's public profile, built on 'Twitter Philanthropy' and meme stock promotion, has made him an unusual but influential "attack dog" in the administration's efforts to challenge independent institutions like the Fed.</p>

Rare earth elements are essential for various advanced technologies, making China's dominance in their supply a potent economic and strategic tool.

Amid a slowdown in global EV demand, Lamborghini is reconsidering its previously announced all-electric grand touring car for 2028, potentially opting for a hybrid model instead.

Its success is attributed to effective seasonal branding, its association with comfort food during economic downturns, and its prevalence on social media, particularly Instagram.

The administration defends its actions as necessary to reform an inefficient system, but critics point to the termination of grants for disaster preparedness, impacting communities across the U.S. This comes as FEMA has lost approximately one-third of its staff and seen leadership changes since Trump's return to office.</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock surged over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to purchase wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for approximately $23 billion in cash. The deal, expected to close in mid-2026, will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets. EchoStar stated the transaction is part of resolving Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The companies also expanded their network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate Boost Mobile as a hybrid mobile network operator, a move AT&T CEO John Stankey described as a "win all the way around."</p>

          <p>India's Air Force (IAF) is grappling with a severe shortage of fighter squadrons, set to drop to 29 after the retirement of MiG-21 jets, far below the sanctioned strength of 42. This deficit raises concerns amid ongoing tensions with Pakistan and China, whose air forces are significantly larger. Despite a push for self-reliance in defense, indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) production faces massive delays, with a recent $7.2 billion deal for 97 Tejas Mark 1A fighters still dependent on imported engines. Experts warn that by the time these jets are delivered, they may already be outdated, highlighting the need for faster modernization and private sector involvement.</p>

Geophysicists at Australian National University analyzed seismic wave data from decades of global earthquakes, revealing variations in the inner core's anisotropy that indicate distinct layers. This finding suggests a change in the structure of iron within the core, possibly pointing to two separate cooling events in Earth's history. The presence of an innermost layer could explain inconsistencies in current models of Earth's structure and offers new insights into our planet's deep past.</p>
