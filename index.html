          <p>As the number of foreign residents in Japan reaches record levels, associations are urging politicians to address immigration effectively and recognize the contributions of foreigners beyond just labor. At a recent event in Tokyo, panelists highlighted the need for policies that integrate foreigners into society, protect their rights, and provide forums for their voices to be heard. Concerns were raised about the lack of clear immigration policies and the difficulties faced by technical interns, especially in rural areas. The need for political leadership to shape immigration policy and foster harmonious coexistence was emphasized.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch oversaw the destruction of over 3,500 seized illegal firearms, including handguns and rifles, which were fed into a gun chipper and recycled.

          <p>The Japanese government has announced a package of emergency economic measures to mitigate the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, ahead of further trade negotiations. The package includes support for corporate financing and initiatives to boost domestic consumption, aiming to alleviate concerns that the tariffs could harm Japan's exports and broader economy. Meanwhile, a Japanese negotiator is scheduled to visit the U.S. for a second round of tariff talks, as Japan seeks to navigate the complexities of the U.S. trade policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council suggests that the United States may be overestimating its leverage in tariff negotiations with China, as Beijing has been preparing for this situation since mid-2018. According to the advocate, China does not feel the same urgency to reach a deal and is wary of being perceived as bullied on the world stage. This perspective comes after President Trump indicated he was considering reducing tariffs on Chinese goods, while China has denied making overtures or seeing progress in bilateral talks.</p>

          <p>Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was not selected in the first round of the NFL Draft, despite earlier projections suggesting he could be a top pick.

Sanders' slide down the draft board was a surprise, with the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints potentially interested in a quarterback in later rounds.

          <p>The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has stated that Ukraine may need to cede territory to Russia as part of a peace deal, amid growing pressure from President Donald Trump for territorial concessions. While emphasizing that Ukrainians would never accept occupation, Klitschko suggested that giving up territory could be a temporary solution for peace. His comments come after a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv and highlight the difficult decisions facing Ukrainian leadership in the pursuit of peace.</p>

          <p>The UK Post Office has spent over £600 million of public funds to keep using the flawed Horizon IT system, even after deciding to replace it more than a decade ago. The original 1999 agreement with Fujitsu meant the Post Office did not own the code for the core system, making it costly to switch suppliers or inspect the software. This dependence on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters for alleged cash shortfalls, highlighting a major miscarriage of justice.</p>
