        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently passed Republican legislative package includes a major overhaul of federal student loan programs, which critics argue will harm low-income families. The bill proposes significant changes to Pell Grants, which primarily benefit students from families earning less than $60,000, by increasing credit-hour requirements and eliminating eligibility for some part-time students. Additionally, the legislation would end interest-free subsidized loans and impose new lifetime borrowing caps, potentially making higher education less accessible and driving students toward private lenders with higher interest rates.

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed President Trump's signature legislative package in a tight 218-214 vote, sending the bill to his desk. The legislation, which includes trillions in tax cuts alongside increased funding for immigration enforcement, faced a difficult path, requiring significant pressure from party leadership to overcome opposition from a handful of Republican holdouts.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on administrative leave pending an investigation. The action follows the discovery of a letter where employees allegedly misused their official titles and positions to mislead the public about agency matters. An EPA spokesperson stated the agency has a "zero-tolerance policy" for career staff undermining the administration's agenda. This development comes after the Trump administration fired or reassigned nearly 500 EPA employees and eliminated its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Environmental Justice departments earlier this year.</p>

In apparent retaliation, Azerbaijan arrested Russian journalists and other citizens, accusing them of various crimes. Experts suggest this conflict is rooted in deeper issues, including annoyance from Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev over Moscow's handling of a plane crash last year, signaling a potential shift in Russia's influence in the Caucasus region.</p>

The authors claim that a proposed reorganization would shutter most offices in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), lay off a majority of its expert staff, and rebrand remaining offices along ideological lines. This move, they contend, undermines decades of bipartisan foreign policy, silences critical expertise in policy debates, and signals a retreat from America's commitment to global justice and equality.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has been unexpectedly eliminated from Wimbledon in the second round, losing to 36-year-old Croatian veteran Marin Cilic. The 23-year-old Draper, seeded fourth and considered a strong contender, was defeated in four sets, continuing his struggle to advance past the second round at the All England Club. Cilic, a former Wimbledon finalist now ranked 83rd, dominated the first two sets with a powerful serve and deep returns. Draper expressed significant disappointment after the match, calling it one of the toughest losses of his career.</p>

          <p>Discussions have reportedly begun for a potential settlement in Donald Trump's 2021 lawsuit against Google and its CEO, Sundar Pichai. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube, a Google subsidiary, illegally censored Trump following the January 6 Capitol attack. This development comes after both Meta and X (formerly Twitter) settled similar lawsuits with Trump for multi-million dollar payments to his presidential library fund. The analysis suggests that despite the legal case having been previously dismissed, the political pressure of facing a sitting president may compel Google to settle rather than risk a prolonged and contentious legal battle.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has acknowledged that MI5 committed a "serious failing" by providing false evidence to multiple courts and has agreed that a further independent investigation is necessary. The admission follows a High Court ruling that rejected two previous official inquiries into the matter as deficient and unreliable. The case originated from a BBC report on a neo-Nazi state agent who had abused his former partner. The Home Office has not commented on the status of the senior MI5 official whose evidence was found by the court to be inaccurate.</p>
