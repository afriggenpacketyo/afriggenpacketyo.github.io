          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:22:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that countries aligning with what he termed "anti-American policies of BRICS" will face an additional 10% tariff with no exceptions. This declaration followed a BRICS joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures, widely seen as a response to Trump's own tariff strategies. The BRICS bloc, which recently expanded to include nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia, aims to challenge Western-dominated global governance and the U.S. dollar's prominence. The administration also confirmed it will begin delivering letters on Monday detailing country-specific tariff rates and any new trade agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Formerly a tropical storm, Chantal was downgraded to a depression after making landfall in South Carolina, bringing heavy rainfall and heightened flash flood concerns across the Carolinas and into Virginia. While tropical storm warnings were canceled, flood watches remained in effect, with some areas expecting up to six inches of rain. In Chatham County, North Carolina, a highway collapsed, and over 100 roads were flooded, prompting emergency rescues of stranded motorists. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves northeast, but dangerous surf and rip currents will persist along the Atlantic coast for several days.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a "client list" associated with deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein. The review, ordered by Trump-appointed leadership, also released footage that officials state further confirms Epstein's 2019 death in a Manhattan jail was a suicide, aiming to dispel long-standing conspiracy theories. According to a memo, investigators did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges against any uncharged third parties connected to Epstein's sex trafficking crimes. The DOJ stated that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the goal of bringing justice to victims.</p>

          <p>A significant global trend shows women are having fewer children, leading to record-low fertility rates in the U.S. and worldwide, which presents complex societal challenges. This shift is partly driven by increased economic independence and life choices for women, but it raises concerns about future labor shortages, the viability of social safety nets like Social Security, and potential depopulation in many countries. While some, like Elon Musk, warn of a "population collapse," many demographers see potential environmental benefits and view the crisis narrative as exaggerated. The article explores the debate between pronatalist policies and concerns over reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the increasing "financialization" of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's deepening housing crisis and a source of political instability. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have poured trillions into residential real estate, treating homes as a lucrative asset class, which has inflated prices and rents beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. This has exacerbated inequality and fueled support for far-right movements. The author contends that the narrative of investors solving supply shortages is false, as their business model relies on scarcity to maximize profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States men's national team's 2-1 defeat to Mexico in the Gold Cup final has intensified concerns about the team's progress under coach Mauricio Pochettino, less than a year before the World Cup on home soil. A victory would have provided a much-needed boost of confidence, but the loss highlights a pattern of inconsistency against top-ranked opponents. While the tournament allowed Pochettino to test fringe players and build some cohesion, key stars were absent, and questions remain about the team's readiness for 2026. The coach cited the pro-Mexico crowd as a factor but acknowledged the need to establish clear principles for the team moving forward.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in all 10 participants of a clinical trial. The therapy targets deafness caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene, which prevents the production of a key protein for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers used a harmless virus to deliver a functional copy of the gene into the inner ear, with some patients, particularly children, regaining almost full hearing within weeks. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope that similar approaches could one day treat other common forms of genetic deafness.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party" faces a daunting reality, as creating a viable third party in the United States is an immensely complex and expensive undertaking. Experts note that any new party must navigate a thicket of 50 different state laws for ballot access, many of which are designed to favor the existing two-party system. The process would likely require years of effort, cost hundreds of millions of dollars in signature gathering and legal challenges, and still face long odds of success. While Musk has the financial resources, the logistical and legal barriers have historically prevented even well-funded third-party movements from gaining a national foothold.</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda-affiliated group JNIM has become a dominant jihadist force in West Africa, responsible for a surge of violence across Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. Formed in 2017, the group has expanded its operations significantly, exploiting local grievances and state weakness to recruit thousands of fighters and impose its strict interpretation of Islamic law. The military juntas that have seized power in the region have failed to contain the threat, with JNIM's attacks increasing in scale and frequency. The group funds its operations through cattle-rustling, extortion, and taxing local economies, creating a cycle of instability that continues to destabilize the entire Sahel region.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has issued a call for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. In a statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, the leaders described AI as a "unique opportunity" but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. They stressed the need for international technical standards developed through the UN to ensure trust, security, and reliability in AI applications. The statement also advocated for open-source collaboration, the protection of digital sovereignty, and ensuring that developing nations have equal access to AI technologies and research.</p>

Survivors described horrific scenes of being evacuated by military trucks as first responders pulled others from the water.

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was destroyed by a massive explosion after an SUV involved in a three-vehicle accident crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line. Two occupants of the SUV were rescued from the vehicle by courageous bystanders just minutes before the building was engulfed in flames and subsequently exploded. No one was inside the restaurant or adjacent businesses at the time of the crash, and no injuries were reported from the explosion itself, though multiple people from the initial accident were hospitalized.

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Containment has increased to 30%, aided by an influx of personnel and favorable weather conditions. The fire, which started near the Santa Barbara County line, is threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument and has forced evacuations, with about 50 structures at risk. While crews are optimistic about their recent progress, they are preparing for a potential heat wave later in the week that could create more challenging firefighting conditions.</p>

The talks, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, are focused on a U.S.-led proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a hostage release and increased humanitarian aid. However, significant gaps remain, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal, conditions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo during their sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The team, currently holding one of the worst records in the National League, has struggled to rebuild after trading away its championship-era stars. Rizzo had been the team's general manager since 2009, overseeing the construction of the title-winning roster, while Martinez managed the team for over six seasons. In a statement, owner Mark Lerner cited the team's poor on-field performance, stating that a "fresh approach" was necessary for the club's future.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will extend this time off to grieve for those who suffer a loss earlier in the pregnancy. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will ensure people are not forced back to work before they are ready. The move was welcomed by campaigners as a hugely important step that acknowledges the significant impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost early education standards, the UK government will offer qualified nursery teachers tax-free payments of £4,500 to work in 20 designated disadvantaged areas in England. The scheme is part of a broader £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at narrowing the attainment gap among preschool children. Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the plan will help give the youngest children a better start, though critics argue that other government policies have financially strained the nursery sector, potentially undermining the initiative's impact.</p>

An analysis points out that the team is barely over .500 against opponents with winning records, a stark contrast to last year and a potential problem for the postseason. The team was recently swept by the Houston Astros, being outscored 29-6 in the series. Furthermore, the Dodgers are battling a growing list of injuries to key players, which is straining the roster's depth and could impact their performance heading into the All-Star break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policy under the Trump administration is forcing companies worldwide to fundamentally rethink their global supply chains. An Illinois toymaker, for example, is moving production from China to Vietnam and India to avoid steep import taxes, despite the costs and logistical challenges of vetting new factories. Similarly, a Canadian restaurant chain is altering its menu because retaliatory Canadian tariffs have made essential U.S.-made kitchen equipment too expensive to import. This disruption highlights how ongoing trade disputes are creating a ripple effect, compelling businesses to make difficult, long-term strategic decisions to mitigate financial risk.
