          <p>An attack at the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, injured six people during a march supporting Israeli hostages. Witnesses reported that the suspect, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails, allegedly shouting "free Palestine" during the incident. The FBI is investigating the event as a targeted act of terrorism, and the victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, are receiving medical treatment for burn injuries. Authorities evacuated several blocks of Pearl Street following the attack, and officials condemned the violence as a hate-filled act of terror.</p>

          <p>A report by Universities UK warns that students may face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more effectively on course delivery. The report suggests that greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and improve efficiency amid financial challenges and a drop in international student enrollment. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has expressed a willingness to support collaboration where possible, but existing business laws designed to promote competition may hinder such efforts. The government is currently reviewing higher education funding in England, with a report expected later this year.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs. Their report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary housing, as widespread displacement of families affects children's education and well-being. One mother, Shanice Aird, shared her struggles with finding suitable accommodation for her family, highlighting the difficulties faced by homeless families. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately-owned land without compensation, sparking controversy. The government claims the law aims to increase black ownership of land, while critics, including Donald Trump, argue it discriminates against white farmers. Legal experts say the law would only apply in rare circumstances for "public interest," such as land reform, and compensation would usually be paid. The move aims to address historical land imbalances dating back to the apartheid era.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents across three provinces, leading to diminished air quality in both Canada and parts of the United States. Manitoba has declared a state of emergency, with approximately 17,000 people evacuated. Smoke from the fires has worsened air quality and reduced visibility, prompting warnings from Saskatchewan's Public Safety Agency. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service is deploying resources to assist in fighting the blazes, and evacuation centers have been opened across Manitoba.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer argues that the "Trump discount" is negatively impacting the stock market due to the unpredictability and power of the White House. He claims that even strong companies are being held back because their prospects can be altered with a stroke of the president's pen. Cramer highlights several sectors, including retail, drug companies, and tech, where he believes the administration's policies are creating uncertainty and suppressing stock valuations. He contrasts this with Europe, where consistency, even if it is the consistency of mediocrity, is attracting investors. (not investment advice)</p>

After 10 years Rushdie came out of hiding and moved to the United States, where he felt safe. Then, on Aug. 12, 2022, at a literary festival in Chautauqua, New York, he was attacked by a knife-wielding assailant. Rushdie was stabbed 15 times and nearly died.
