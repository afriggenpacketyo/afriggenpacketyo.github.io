          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his support for Attorney General Pam Bondi as she faces criticism from some of his own allies regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The controversy stems from a Justice Department memo stating no "client list" was found, which frustrated figures like Elon Musk and Dan Bongino who expected major revelations. The article details a growing rift within Trump's circle over the handling of the politically sensitive case and the perceived lack of transparency from the DOJ.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," is taking a prominent and combative role in defending the administration's mass deportation policies. At a recent conference, he aggressively confronted a heckler and has since made controversial admissions, including that immigration agents make "collateral arrests" of U.S. citizens. Homan's statements, including a walk-back on comments suggesting racial profiling, highlight the politically charged nature of his role as the face of the White House's immigration enforcement strategy.</p>
