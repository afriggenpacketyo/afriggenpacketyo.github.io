He is only the fifth runner-up to come back and win and the first since Sean Conley in 2001. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is an annual event in the US where students compete to spell increasingly difficult words, showcasing their linguistic skills.

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik's career in law enforcement spanned several decades, and he played a crucial role in the city's response to the attacks. Kerik's career was later marred by federal corruption and tax crimes to which he pleaded guilty. He was pardoned by President Trump in 2020, marking a controversial end to a complex public life. His contributions to the city's police force and his involvement in the aftermath of 9/11 have left a lasting impact.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist cautions that financial sanctions could become a new battleground in the US-China rivalry, though full-scale sanctions remain unlikely. Lian Ping suggests Washington might initially target specific Chinese entities before gradually expanding sanctions to potentially exclude China from the US dollar system. Lian notes that sanctioning China within the Swift system could significantly damage the system itself, given China's global trade and investment standing. He also said that countries with trade and investment ties to China would shift to using the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinaâ€™s alternative for settlements, which would undermine Swiftâ€™s importance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment dropped from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many respondents feeling pessimistic about the industry's outlook. Nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, and 27% expect business travel spending to decrease. Despite concerns, global airfares have slightly decreased, offering a potential upside.</p>

          <p>Jewish foreign students at Harvard are expressing fear and uncertainty amid political tensions and accusations of antisemitism. Some students feel like collateral damage in the ongoing conflict between President Trump and the university. The government has given Harvard 30 days to prove it meets the requirements of enrolling foreign students, potentially impacting international Jewish students. Some students draw parallels with democratic backsliding in their home countries, while others believe Trump is using antisemitism as a cover to control elite education.</p>

His wife's quick thinking, holding his head above water, and the assistance of a sled dog tourism company, which provided a helicopter for rescue, were crucial to his survival. Rescuers used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder, and the man was airlifted to a hospital.

          <p>President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs is being challenged in court, threatening his ability to use them as an economic weapon. A US Court of International Trade ruled that he exceeded his emergency powers, but a federal appeals court has temporarily stayed the ruling. The Trump administration argues that a ruling against the president would undermine his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. Trump has used tariffs extensively, raising and lowering rates seemingly according to his mood, leading to uncertainty for markets and global leaders.</p>
