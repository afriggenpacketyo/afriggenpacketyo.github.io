          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations, projecting continued strong sales growth driven by AI infrastructure demand. Despite this positive performance, the company's stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading. This was attributed to data center revenue falling slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report highlighted the ongoing AI boom's impact on Nvidia's business, with significant growth in its gaming and robotics divisions as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a campaign event in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentine President Javier Milei's motorcade was attacked by protesters who threw stones, plants, and bottles. The president was uninjured and quickly removed from the scene by his security detail, though the incident cut the rally short. The attack occurs ahead of crucial midterm elections in October, which are seen as a referendum on Milei's libertarian policies aimed at tackling Argentina's severe economic issues. Scuffles broke out between his supporters and opponents following the event.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just weeks after her Senate confirmation. Her lawyers allege she was targeted for refusing to approve "unscientific, reckless directives." The departure coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and political interference as reasons for leaving. This leadership shakeup occurs during a turbulent period for the agency, marked by budget cuts and policy shifts under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

The 23-year-old suspect, identified as a former student of the attached school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Seventeen other people, including 14 children, were injured in the attack. Authorities are investigating a video manifesto the shooter scheduled to post online and are treating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a potential hate crime.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that Southern California and the Central Valley are facing a growing risk of intense dust storms known as haboobs, similar to one that recently hit Phoenix. Factors like climate change-induced drying, water overuse, and wildfires are contributing to the conditions that create these massive walls of dust. These storms pose significant air quality and health risks, as the dust can carry toxic materials like pesticides, heavy metals, and fungal spores that cause Valley fever. Researchers are working to improve forecasting for these events to better protect the millions of residents affected.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has placed more than 20 current employees on paid administrative leave after they signed an open letter to Congress. The letter, known as the "Katrina Declaration," was signed by 191 current and former employees and argued that Trump administration policies are reversing critical reforms made after Hurricane Katrina. The signatories expressed fears of retaliation, and the suspensions have been confirmed via emails reviewed by CBS News. FEMA responded by calling the signatories "bureaucrats" who are resistant to necessary reforms aimed at reducing inefficiency.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's shocking Carabao Cup elimination by fourth-tier Grimsby Town has intensified pressure on manager Ruben Amorim. The defeat, which came via a penalty shootout, marks a new low in a difficult period for the club, which has struggled despite significant summer spending on new players. Amorim's system and player management are now under the microscope, with questions arising about the marginalization of young talents like Kobbie Mainoo. The result puts the club's new leadership, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Omar Berrada, in a difficult position regarding the manager they appointed.</p>

The discussion comes amid a dire humanitarian crisis, with the UN Security Council recently calling the famine in Gaza a "man-made crisis."

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering 30 hours of funded care per week to working parents of children from nine months old in England. To be eligible, most parents must earn above a minimum threshold but less than £100,000 annually. While the program aims to alleviate high childcare costs, concerns persist about the availability of sufficient staff and places to meet the increased demand. Additionally, many providers charge for extras not covered by government funding, which can create affordability issues for some families.</p>

          <p>The brief, controversial rebranding of Cracker Barrel's logo has ignited a culture war debate, with the company quickly reverting to its old design after a right-wing backlash. This article argues the controversy is ironic, as Cracker Barrel has always presented a corporate, sanitized version of rural Americana rather than being an authentic "mom-and-pop" establishment. The chain was founded alongside the interstate highway system, which contributed to the decline of the small towns it romanticizes. The incident reveals how brands associated with specific political demographics can become flashpoints for cultural anxieties about change and corporate influence.</p>

          <p>The Pickett Fire in the San Francisco Bay Area is creating a significant threat to Napa Valley's wine industry, even for vineyards not directly in the fire's path. Winery owners are concerned about "smoke taint," where grapes absorb compounds from smoke, rendering the resulting wine unpalatable and unsellable. One owner reported losing two entire vintages in recent years due to smoke from previous fires, describing the wine as tasting "like licking an ashtray." This recurring problem highlights the cascading economic consequences of increasingly frequent and intense wildfires in the region.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels sent from China to the UK under a tax exemption rule has surged to £3 billion last year, more than doubling from the previous year. This increase is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The UK government is currently reviewing the rule that allows imports valued under £135 to avoid customs duties. UK retailers argue this loophole creates unfair competition, and they are urging swifter government action to level the playing field and protect consumers from potentially unregulated goods.</p>

          <p>In a provocative political maneuver, Republicans in the California assembly have introduced a resolution to split the state in two, separating the liberal coastal areas from the more conservative inland regions. This "two-state solution" proposal is a response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw the state's congressional districts. Republicans argue the Democratic plan would silence rural and conservative voices, while Democrats have dismissed the GOP proposal as a political "stunt" and a gerrymander in its own right. The clash underscores the intense partisan battle over congressional control playing out in states across the country.</p>

This diplomatic incident adds to growing tensions between the two NATO allies, fueled by President Trump's repeated public interest in acquiring the semi-autonomous Danish territory.</p>

The article notes the long-standing animosity between the two, dating back to Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner.

          <p>The rise of Reform UK is creating a significant challenge for the Scottish Conservatives, who have now seen three Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) quit in four months. The latest defector, Graham Simpson, joined Reform, which has been consistently outpolling the Tories in recent Holyrood surveys. This trend is forcing the Scottish Conservative leader to navigate a difficult political landscape, risking the alienation of moderate voters if the party shifts further right to counter the threat from Reform. The situation mirrors the fragmentation that weakened the Scottish Labour party after the 2014 independence referendum.</p>

Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power, Beijing now finds itself often portrayed as a revisionist power seeking to upend the international order. China, however, uses the anniversary to frame itself as a primary guarantor of that same post-war order, which it argues its immense sacrifices helped establish. This perspective challenges the Western-led narrative that casts China's rise as an inherent threat to global stability.</p>

However, the approval comes with new restrictions, limiting their use primarily to seniors and individuals with underlying health conditions.
