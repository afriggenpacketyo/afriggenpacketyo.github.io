          <p>An accidental discovery of 300,000 hours of CCTV footage has exposed a major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland. The footage revealed hundreds of incidents of physical and emotional abuse against vulnerable, non-verbal patients by staff members. Despite the evidence being found nearly eight years ago, triggering the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation, no cases have yet come to trial, and families have not been permitted to view the footage. The ongoing public inquiry has faced criticism for its perceived lack of rigor in holding hospital management accountable for the systemic failures.</p>

          <p>A news correspondent provides an inside look at the extraordinary and chaotic trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who were convicted of manslaughter in the death of their baby. The couple displayed a united front but showed contempt for the court process, causing significant delays through frequent disruptions, changing legal teams, and refusing to attend sessions. The report details their bizarre behavior, including flirtatious interactions and outbursts, which exasperated the judge and nearly collapsed the proceedings multiple times. Ultimately, their actions highlighted a detachment from the gravity of the charges they faced.</p>

          <p>Search and rescue operations in Texas are being hindered by forecasts of more heavy rain following devastating floods that have killed at least 131 people. The majority of the victims were children at a Christian summer camp, swept away when over a foot of rain fell in under an hour. With 101 people still unaccounted for, authorities face criticism over the lack of flash-flood warning sirens in Kerr County. Governor Abbott has called for a special legislative session to investigate the emergency response as the community grapples with one of the deadliest floods in recent U.S. history.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler overcame a significant weakness in his game by enlisting putting coach Phil Kenyon in late 2023. Previously ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best from tee to green, Scheffler saw a dramatic turnaround after Kenyon helped with his green reading and facilitated a switch to a mallet putter. This change was a catalyst for a remarkable season, in which Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal. The collaboration highlights how a targeted adjustment can elevate an elite athlete to a new level of dominance.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' forecasts and keeping the nation on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, the data reveals underlying fragility, with retail sales growth slowing significantly and the real estate investment slump deepening. While resilient exports have provided some support, this has been driven by price-cutting, which is intensifying deflationary pressures. These mixed signals have fueled calls from economists for Beijing to implement further fiscal stimulus and deeper structural reforms to sustain the economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security had announced the termination of these protections, which shield recipients from deportation and provide work authorization, arguing conditions in Afghanistan had improved. Immigrant advocacy group CASA challenged the decision, leading to the court's intervention, which keeps the protections in place for at least another week while the case is reviewed. The move provides a brief reprieve for Afghans who fled their country, many of whom assisted the U.S. during its two-decade presence there.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales and up to 40% of all passenger cars in its capital, Oslo.

The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has effectively transformed the nation's automotive landscape, making EVs a common sight.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh won the 2025 MLB Home Run Derby, making history as the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to ever claim the title. Raleigh, who led the major leagues with 38 home runs at the All-Star break, defeated Tampa Bay's Junior Caminero 18-15 in the final round of the competition. He advanced through the earlier rounds with clutch hitting, including a tiebreaker win in the first round. Pitched to by his father, Raleigh became the second Mariner to win the event, following in the footsteps of Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University provides the first evidence of an animal responding to sounds produced by plants. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making high-frequency "screaming" sounds, which plants emit when they are stressed or dehydrated. Though inaudible to humans, these sounds can be perceived by many insects and some mammals. The discovery opens up a new field of study into a potential invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication between plants and animals, which could influence behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter.</p>

          <p>A joint report from the WHO and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide were completely unvaccinated in 2024, leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. The report highlights a worrying trend in Europe, where cases of whooping cough tripled and measles infections doubled amid stagnating or falling vaccination rates. Officials attribute the widening coverage gaps to a combination of widespread misinformation and cuts to international aid. The data underscores a growing global health crisis, with the U.S. also experiencing its worst year for measles in a quarter-century.</p>

The food, purchased under the Biden administration for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, is set to be incinerated after repeated requests by federal workers to ship it were allegedly ignored by new political leadership at USAID. The halt on foreign assistance has created a bureaucratic impasse, and the food will now expire in a Dubai warehouse.

          <p>A group of wealthy landowners and charities has initiated a judicial review in the High Court, challenging the U.K. government's recent leasehold reforms. The claimants argue that provisions in the 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which aim to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend their leases or buy their freeholds, violate their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. They claim the changes could cause them to lose hundreds of millions of pounds without adequate compensation. Leaseholder advocacy groups fear the legal challenge will delay much-needed reforms and are frustrated their voices will not be represented in the court proceedings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine through NATO allies, while simultaneously threatening Russia with severe tariffs if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. Under the plan, European nations will send their own Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv, with the U.S. then providing replacements, and the Europeans footing the bill. Trump also threatened 100% secondary tariffs on any country that continues to trade with Russia, a move designed to cripple Moscow's war economy. This marks a significant shift, representing the first time Trump has pledged new military equipment for Ukraine since returning to office.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report often raises questions about why many of its biggest stars are not included, and the reason lies in how they are paid. Many high-profile presenters and actors are not directly employed by the BBC but are instead contracted through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because these companies operate in a competitive commercial market, their salary details are not disclosed to maintain a level playing field. This means the earnings of stars like Claudia Winkleman, Michael McIntyre, and the casts of shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" and "The Traitors" do not appear on the publicly funded list.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a staggering 763% increase in the rate of young children under six accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these pouches make up a small fraction of total nicotine ingestions, they are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospitalization compared to products like cigarettes. Health experts express concern that the flavored, colorfully packaged products are attractive to young children. They are calling for stronger regulations, such as banning flavors, to mitigate the growing toxic ingestion hazard.</p>
