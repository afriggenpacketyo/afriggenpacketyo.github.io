          <p>A recent shooting near a Gaza aid distribution center has resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people and injuries to over 90, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The incident occurred as people were waiting to collect humanitarian aid, with many victims arriving at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis suffering from gunshot wounds. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged a shooting around 500 meters from one of the aid sites run by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, stating that forces fired shots at suspects moving towards them while deviating from access routes. The GHF acknowledged the IDF is investigating whether civilians were injured after moving beyond the designated safe corridor and into a closed military zone, advising civilians to remain in the safe corridor when traveling to their distribution sites. The violence underscores the challenges and dangers surrounding aid distribution in the region. </p>

          <p>Overnight Russian attacks on multiple Ukrainian cities have resulted in at least seven deaths and 27 injuries, according to local officials. Ukraine's air force reported that 75 out of 112 Russian drones launched into the country were either shot down or neutralized. The strikes, which occurred hours after peace talks in Istanbul, targeted regions close to the front lines, including Sumy and Kharkiv, with President Zelenskyy condemning the attacks as a deliberate act against civilians. These ongoing attacks suggest that President Putin may not have a genuine interest in peace despite the ongoing U.S.-brokered talks. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men were found guilty in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction after they freed the marine animals, believing the line was illegal. Although they avoided prison time, they were ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and international travel. Their attorney expressed that justice has finally prevailed and that the prosecution was unjust. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation has fallen to 1.9% in May, according to flash data from Eurostat, dipping below the European Central Bank's 2% target. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, tobacco, and alcohol, also eased to 2.3% in May, while services inflation cooled to 3.2%. The figures will be considered by the ECB as it prepares to make its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets pricing in a high chance of a further 25-basis-point rate cut.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned that global economic growth is expected to slow down this year, largely due to President Trump's US tariffs. Worldwide growth is now forecast to be 2.9%, a decrease from the previous estimate of 3.1%. The OECD attributes the downgrade to a significant rise in trade barriers and cautions that the weakened economic outlook will have widespread effects. Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing tariffs has created uncertainty, impacting various countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed following disagreements over immigration proposals, leading to Geert Wilders' far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrawing from the ruling coalition. Wilders stated that his party's departure was due to the alliance's lack of support for their asylum proposal. The PVV had won a landslide victory in the Netherlands' general election in 2023, but conflicting ideas on immigration ultimately led to the collapse of the former coalition and the resignation of former Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The current government crisis comes just weeks before the Netherlands is due to host world leaders for a NATO summit. </p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that the financial burden on families with incarcerated loved ones is significant, costing them nearly $350 billion annually. This figure is about four times the amount the federal government estimates it costs taxpayers to operate the nation's prisons and jails. The report, from FWD.us, highlights that families spend an average of $4,000 a year on incarcerated relatives, covering expenses like phone calls, visits, and commissary purchases. Researchers emphasize that these costs disproportionately affect families who can least afford them, exacerbating financial instability and perpetuating cycles of poverty and incarceration. </p>

Republicans have long criticized EV incentives as wasteful spending, while supporters argue that eliminating them would hinder EV adoption and put U.S. manufacturing investments at risk.

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after KKR, a US private equity giant, withdrew from plans to invest in the company. This setback increases the possibility that Thames Water will collapse into a government-supervised administration.
