          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, delivering a significant victory to the Trump administration in a 6-3 decision. The ruling partially stays injunctions against President Trump's executive order concerning birthright citizenship but does not rule on the order's constitutionality. This decision restricts injunctions to only protect the specific plaintiffs in a case, rather than applying universally across the country. Critics, including dissenting justices, argue this move significantly weakens judicial checks on executive power and could endanger various rights.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed continued confidence in Apple, advising investors not to abandon the company despite its stock lagging behind market averages.

However, Cramer emphasized his faith in CEO Tim Cook and pointed to Apple's history of rebounding from tough periods, suggesting such times have historically been excellent buying opportunities.

          <p>NASA has announced that two research aircraft, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California for scientific purposes. The flights, part of the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), will occur between 1,000 and 10,000 feet over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The planes will perform unique maneuvers, such as vertical spirals and simulated missed landings, to sample atmospheric gases and measure land and water surfaces. Officials have advised the public not to be alarmed by the low-flying planes, as they are part of a mission to provide students with real-world research experience.</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test match, driven by a powerful performance from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed dramatically in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets after initially showing promise in their chase of 301 runs. Hazlewood was the key architect of the collapse, taking five wickets for 43 runs and dismantling the hosts' top order. Despite some late resistance, Australia's bowlers wrapped up the match with two full days to spare, showcasing their clinical efficiency.</p>

          <p>A backyard tackling game popular in Pacific Islander communities is being commercialized into a global sport called the Run It Championship League, sparking significant controversy. The game involves two unarmed competitors running directly at each other, with a panel judging who dominates the collision. While organizers tout safety protocols and large cash prizes, medical experts and critics condemn the sport for its inherent dangers, labeling it as "commercialising concussion." The debate has intensified following the death of a teenager who reportedly died after copying the game, raising profound questions about the ethics of promoting such a high-impact activity.</p>

          <p>A team of specialized divers has successfully completed the first human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank during a storm in 1904 off the coast of Sydney, Australia. The wreck, which lies at a depth of 525 feet, was only discovered in 2022, and all 32 people aboard were lost in the disaster. The divers navigated pitch-black conditions to survey and film the ship's remains, documenting its crumbled bow and other features during a brief nine-minute window at the site. The complex and dangerous dive required a six-hour ascent for safe decompression, with future missions planned to create a more detailed scan of the historic wreck.</p>

          <p>Chinese businesses with investments and trade deals in the Middle East, particularly in Iran, are facing significant disruption and uncertainty due to the escalating conflict in the region. Exporters report that clients have disappeared, orders have been canceled, and shipping costs have surged, putting business plans at risk. The conflict threatens China's economic interests and its broader strategic partnerships in a volatile but crucial area for trade and resources. This instability is forcing many Chinese entrepreneurs to reconsider their commitments and tighten their belts as they navigate the economic shockwaves of the war.</p>

          <p>University of Virginia President James E. Ryan has resigned from his position amid a federal investigation into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The resignation comes after the Trump administration's Justice Department pressured the university to dismantle its DEI programs, accusing Ryan of merely rebranding them. Sources indicate the university feared losing federal funding, including student financial aid and research grants, if a compromise was not reached. This marks a significant escalation in the administration's campaign to reshape higher education, extending its focus from private Ivy League schools to a prominent public university.</p>

Critics on social media and academic experts condemned the remarks as misogynistic and an attempt to detract from substantive policy discussions. They argued that such personal attacks reinforce harmful stereotypes that a woman's worth is tied to her marital status and are often used to delegitimize women in positions of power.</p>

          <p>California has approved a $321 billion budget designed to close a $12 billion deficit, which involves scaling back several progressive initiatives. Key changes include pausing new enrollments for undocumented adult immigrants in the state's low-income healthcare program, Medi-Cal, starting in 2026. To plug the budget hole, the state will rely on savings, internal borrowing, and payment delays, avoiding new taxes on residents. While lawmakers managed to prevent some of the deeper cuts proposed by the governor, the budget reflects the fiscal challenges facing the state amid potential federal funding cuts and economic uncertainty.</p>

The judge's decision stated the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession.

These state and local increases stand in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009.

Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, dismissed privacy concerns, stating that the social stigma surrounding pornography does not exempt the industry from valid regulation.
