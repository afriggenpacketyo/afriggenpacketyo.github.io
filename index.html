Coach JJ Redick lamented missed calls and acknowledged the team's inability to solve the Timberwolves' matchup problems.

          <p>The BBC has identified members of Kenya's security forces who fatally shot anti-tax protesters outside the country's parliament last June. An analysis of over 5,000 images revealed that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat, contradicting official narratives. The BBC's investigation traced the fatal shots to specific rifles of a police officer and a soldier. Despite public outcry and a parliamentary committee ordering an investigation, no report has been issued, and no one has been held accountable for the deaths.</p>
