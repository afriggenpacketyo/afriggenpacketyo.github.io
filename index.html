        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a critical examination of violent crime in Chicago, using the murder of police officer Aréanah Preston to illustrate the ongoing crisis. It challenges political attempts to minimize the issue by highlighting that despite some statistical declines, Chicago's homicide rate remains significantly higher than in cities like New York and Los Angeles. The piece delves into systemic causes such as historical disinvestment, police ineffectiveness, and the social decay of certain neighborhoods. It contrasts the grim reality faced by residents with the detached rhetoric of politicians, while also acknowledging grassroots efforts to interrupt cycles of violence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pizza Hut is set to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations in the UK, resulting in 1,210 job losses after its operator, DC London Pie Limited, entered administration. However, Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum! Brands, has intervened to acquire and save 64 other sites, preserving 1,276 jobs and ensuring operational continuity. This restructuring follows a previous administration less than a year ago, highlighting the brand's struggle to remain relevant in a competitive market that has shifted towards more upmarket pizza options. Experts suggest Pizza Hut has also failed to effectively establish a strong presence on social media compared to its rivals.</p>

          <p>New York Giants linebacker Brian Burns voiced his anger following a narrow 33-32 loss to the Denver Broncos, a game in which the Giants squandered a 19-point lead. Burns was captured on video criticizing the team's defensive strategy on the final drive, specifically the decision to rush only three defenders and drop eight into coverage. Despite his frustration with the scheme, he later took personal responsibility in the locker room, acknowledging his own mistakes and stating that the players must execute better. Burns is currently having a standout season, leading the NFL with nine sacks through seven games.</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged 17% after the company announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This strategic move aligns with the U.S. government's goal of creating a domestic supply chain for critical minerals to reduce dependence on China. CEO Lourenco Goncalves emphasized the company's mining expertise and its intent to contribute to American mineral independence. The announcement has fueled positive investor speculation amid broader efforts by the Trump administration to support domestic rare earth producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant outage in Amazon Web Services' (AWS) US-East-1 region caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites, companies, and government services on Monday.

The incident also paralyzed critical internal tools at Amazon's warehouses, affecting employee and delivery operations. This event highlights the global economy's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, where a single technical fault can have a cascading effect across the internet.</p>

Both sides accused each other of violations but have since recommitted to the peace process.

          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding provides five practical strategies for dealing with a 'control freak' boss without becoming exhausted or frustrated. She advises employees to present rough drafts to invite early input, reinforce their boss's authority with deferential language, and overshare information to satisfy the need for oversight. Other techniques include preemptively asking for feedback to get ahead of criticism and explicitly requesting positive reinforcement to understand what is being done well. These methods are designed to conserve an employee's energy while navigating a challenging professional relationship by working with, rather than against, a manager's controlling tendencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. This trend is attributed to several factors, including historically higher government and manufacturer incentives that lower the initial cost and, consequently, the resale value. The rapid pace of technological advancement, particularly in battery range, also makes older models less desirable on the used market. However, with an influx of more affordable EV models expected and a growing used market, this depreciation gap may begin to narrow as EVs become more mainstream.</p>

The primary obstacle for applicants is the 'means test,' which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify automatically, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. The court also considers factors like recent bankruptcy filings, completion of credit counseling, and any signs of fraudulent activity, such as luxury spending just before filing, which could lead to a denial.</p>

The article questions the judgment of both the club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, and Postecoglou himself for entering into such an obviously incompatible partnership.

          <p>Former NFL All-Pro running back Doug Martin, 36, has died after becoming unresponsive while in the custody of the Oakland Police Department. Officers were responding to reports of a home break-in when they detained Martin, during which a brief struggle occurred. Multiple agencies, including the department's homicide section and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, will investigate the in-custody death in compliance with state law.

          <p>The Economist's annual "Carrie Bradshaw index" has identified the most affordable U.S. cities for individuals to live alone, with Wichita, Kansas, ranking at the top. The index determines affordability by calculating the salary needed to spend no more than 30% of gross income on a studio apartment. This year's report noted a shift, with several cities in Texas, such as Dallas and Austin, moving from the affordable to unaffordable category, potentially due to an influx of middle-class workers driving up rent. The number of unaffordable cities in the index rose to 41, up from 38 last year.</p>

This follows a deal made in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner.

          <p>Jose Rodolfo Villareal-Hernandez, a Mexican cartel leader known as "El Gato" and a former FBI top fugitive, is facing a new federal charge of continuing a criminal enterprise. This charge is connected to his alleged role in orchestrating the 2013 murder-for-hire of a man in a Southlake, Texas shopping center. The murder was reportedly an act of revenge against a lawyer for a rival cartel allegedly involved in the death of Villareal-Hernandez's father. If convicted on the murder-for-hire charge, he could be eligible for the death penalty. After years on the run, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S.</p>

The author calls them "near-miracle drugs" that not only lead to significant weight loss but also show benefits for related health conditions, ultimately improving longevity. While acknowledging the high cost is a major barrier, the piece contends that these expenses are overstated. It suggests that long-term healthcare savings, Medicaid's ability to negotiate lower prices, and the expected decrease in drug costs over time make universal coverage both a moral and economically sound decision.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government faces another shutdown, this article provides a historical overview of the 14 previous funding lapses that have occurred since 1980.

The piece details the duration and central conflicts of past shutdowns under presidents Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Obama, and Trump. These events, once rare, have become more frequent in the last decade, often stemming from deep partisan divides over issues like budget deficits, healthcare reform, and immigration, causing significant economic and operational disruptions.</p>

This could result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and would also halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers, exacerbating an existing shortage.</p>
