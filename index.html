          <h2>US Transportation Secretary Announces Flight Reductions at Newark Airport</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 10:37:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy intends to reduce flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport for several weeks due to ongoing radar outages, delays, and a shortage of air traffic controllers. Duffy plans to meet with airlines to determine the flight reduction, with larger cuts expected during peak international arrival times. The Trump administration has proposed a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the air traffic control system, including new centers and technology upgrades. Additionally, Duffy plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers and offer bonuses to retain experienced staff, although United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby assures the public that flying in and out of Newark remains safe despite these issues.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pope, led his first mass on Sunday, calling for peace and wishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day. The article highlights the anticipation surrounding his election, with many surprised by the choice of an American pontiff. Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh notes that Pope Leo XIV brings together the qualities of an evangelizer, statesman, and governor. During the first days of his papacy, Pope Leo XIV met with cardinals, identified artificial intelligence as a significant threat, and embraced the ideals of inclusivity championed by his predecessor, Pope Francis. He also visited the tomb of Pope Francis in Rome.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks; a judge ordered her release. Ozturk spoke at a news conference alongside Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, expressing gratitude for the support she received. A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had not provided sufficient evidence for her detainment, citing an op-ed she co-authored. Ozturk's lawyers emphasized her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, and that her asthma worsened during detention. Leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release, with Governor Maura Healey criticizing the Trump administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain in effect for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's previous statements. Lutnick dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the increased costs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries would pay the tariffs. However, data suggests that businesses are already attempting to pass these costs on to consumers, leading to a decline in consumer confidence since the tariff announcement. The article notes that prices of some household items have already increased as a result of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A recent four-day clash between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, driven by new military technology and religious nationalism, raises concerns about future conflicts. The conflict involved advanced airstrikes, weaponized drones, and missiles reaching deep into each country's territory. While international diplomacy led to a truce, underlying political tensions and entrenched nationalism persist. Military historian Srinath Raghavan notes that external intervention has historically halted India-Pakistan conflicts, but the current situation reflects more extreme positions and a weaker sense of international responsibility, suggesting a continued risk of escalation.</p>

Marissa Held-Nordling, owner of Little Roo's, has observed changes in shopper behavior, with customers stockpiling baby registry gifts due to uncertainty about product availability. Economic analyst Kyla Scanlon suggests that broad tariffs create economic instability, while Benike argues that manufacturing in the U.S. is too expensive.

While AI platforms are improving and offer enhanced search capabilities, they are not sophisticated enough to handle core business operations.

          <p>The UK will end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The new rules, set to be unveiled on Monday, will require firms to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. The government estimates these measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers from entering the UK over the next year. The government also plans to introduce new training commitments to encourage more UK residents to enter the labor market.</p>

This disjunction marks a break from the liberal paradigm, where economic and political lives were intrinsically linked.

          <p>This poem, 'Infant Longing' by Li-Young Lee, explores themes of loss, longing, and the cyclical nature of life through intimate imagery. The speaker reflects on the world's repeated cycles of violence and innocence lost, invoking the image of his mother finding and burying her own among the slaughtered. He contrasts this with the nurturing comfort of his mother's breast, symbolizing both the end and beginning of the world. The poem uses the metaphor of kissing to represent the sealing and opening of the mouth, eyes, and ultimately, the revelation of an infinite longing.</p>
