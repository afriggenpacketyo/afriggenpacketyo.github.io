          <p>Over 3,200 Boeing defense workers have gone on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer concerning pay and pensions. The strike, led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, affects facilities in Missouri and Illinois responsible for building military aircraft like F-15 fighter jets. This action represents a new challenge for the aviation giant, which has been grappling with numerous safety issues and a costly walkout by its passenger plane workforce in the previous year. The company expressed disappointment but stated it would manage through the disruption.</p>

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed the incident near Yemen's southern Abyan province, noting that dozens remain unaccounted for. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, a path frequently exploited by human smugglers.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic state legislators from office if they do not return to the state. Dozens of Democrats fled to Illinois and New York to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a new congressional map heavily favored by the GOP and former President Donald Trump. The walkout is a high-stakes effort to block the redistricting plan, which Democrats argue is a gerrymandered power grab. This action escalates a political battle over voting maps with national implications for the U.S. House majority.</p>

          <p>Leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported its first monthly delivery decline of the year, signaling the impact of an intense price war within the industry. The company shipped over 341,000 units in July, a drop from the previous month, as competitors also saw fluctuating sales figures. While major players like Li Auto and Nio also reported declines, others such as Xpeng and Xiaomi saw continued growth, highlighting a reshuffling of the competitive landscape. The fierce price competition has drawn concern from Chinese policymakers who have warned against excessive market practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving former transport minister Subramaniam Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping Iswaran cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that the minister had received. The case has shocked Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for corruption among public officials. Due to Ong's poor health, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy."</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's recent strategic moves, suggesting the hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant, is more significant than any player signing. The move indicates that manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a major tactical evolution towards a more direct, high-intensity style of play, mirroring the approach that often challenged his own possession-based philosophy. Recent player acquisitions like Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush, who excel at carrying the ball, further support the theory that City is adapting to a more transitional, dynamic form of football to stay ahead in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Ari Buchman, has died from injuries sustained when a summer camp sailboat collided with a barge in Miami's Biscayne Bay. The crash, which occurred last Monday, also killed 7-year-old Mila Yankelevich and 13-year-old Erin Ko Han. The children were part of a sailing camp run by the Miami Yacht Club when their vessel was struck and dragged under the barge. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the tragic incident, which has devastated the local sailing community.</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has indicated that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for expanded military operations to free the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. This push for a "military solution" comes as diplomatic efforts appear to have stalled, with a growing belief in Israel that Hamas is not interested in a deal. The news emerges as thousands protested in Tel Aviv, demanding the government secure the hostages' release, and after Hamas released a video showing a captive looking severely emaciated. There are believed to be about 20 living hostages still in captivity.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the industry. This signals a maturation of China's biotech sector, which has been supported by a Hong Kong listing rule allowing pre-profit companies to go public. Innovent's anticipated profitability is partly driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which competes with popular GLP-1 drugs. Analysts suggest these companies are now creating substantial value and will no longer need to rely solely on investor funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. According to authorities, the unrest broke out after inmates protested alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. The incident highlights the ongoing problems of gang control, overcrowding, and corruption within Mexico's prison system. A 2012 report found that a majority of the country's prisons are controlled by criminal organizations rather than state authorities.</p>

          <p>Eight decades after the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima, efforts continue on the nearby island of Ninoshima to find the remains of thousands of victims. Following the blast, the island served as a makeshift treatment center where many of the dead and dying were brought, but thousands were buried in chaotic, undocumented operations. Researchers and volunteers are still unearthing bone fragments, driven by a desire to provide closure for families and properly honor those who perished. For many survivors, the search represents an enduring effort to fully account for the war's human cost.</p>

The issue remains a major point of contention in trade negotiations, even as both sides express optimism about reaching a broader deal. The U.S. has threatened a 100% tariff to pressure Beijing, aiming to cut off revenue for Moscow's war in Ukraine and Tehran's support for militant groups. However, China is leveraging its position as a critical buyer, particularly of discounted oil, and appears unwilling to concede on this front. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a novel upgrade for combat drones to dramatically increase their survival rate against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small, side-mounted rocket boosters to drones, allowing them to perform instantaneous, high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to a paper published in a Chinese defense journal, digital simulations showed this system could boost a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent. This innovation could significantly alter the dynamics of aerial warfare.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an international online network where thousands of members, including some in the UK, share graphic videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. Operating on encrypted messaging apps, these groups produce and sell footage of extreme animal cruelty, such as electrocution and mutilation. Evidence suggests some UK-based members discussed adopting kittens from rescue shelters for the purpose of abuse. Animal rights activists who have infiltrated the groups describe it as the "depths of evil," with a new video of a cat's torture or death being uploaded approximately every 14 hours.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Cuba and the UK have initiated a project to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, often called the world's most beautiful snails due to their vibrantly colored shells. This beauty has become a threat, as the illegal shell trade is driving the six known species toward extinction. The international collaboration aims to better understand the snails' genetics and establish a captive breeding program to protect them. The project highlights the paradox where the very features that make a species unique and admired can also lead to its demise.</p>
