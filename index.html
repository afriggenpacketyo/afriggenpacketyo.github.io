        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for twelve offshore wind power infrastructure projects. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the funds were being redirected from what he termed "wasteful" projects to upgrade ports and other maritime infrastructure. The largest single cancellation affects the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind project in California, which lost approximately $427 million in support. This move is part of a broader administration effort against renewable energy development, which includes halting new offshore wind leases and ordering a work stoppage on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project off New England.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has deferred a decision on whether to grant a temporary restraining order to prevent President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook's lawsuit argues that the president lacks legal cause for her removal, which is based on allegations of mortgage fraud from a political operative. During the hearing, Cook's attorney contested that these claims constitute a smear campaign, while a Department of Justice lawyer argued the president has discretion in determining cause. The outcome of this case could significantly impact the composition of the Federal Reserve Board, as Trump seeks to nominate a majority of its members.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a predictable and secure option for savers, with current rates providing substantial returns. A $30,000 deposit could earn anywhere from approximately $317 over a three-month term to over $6,700 in a five-year CD, based on today's rates. The primary benefit of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which protects savers from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, this stability comes at the cost of liquidity, as funds are locked in for the duration of the term, making it crucial for individuals to weigh their need for access to cash against the guaranteed returns.

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that channels like Fox News and Fox Sports remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The agreement was reached after a short-term extension prevented an imminent blackout, which had been threatened due to a dispute over payment terms. YouTube had previously stated that Fox was demanding significantly higher fees than comparable content partners receive. The resolution prevents service disruption for YouTube TV's roughly 9.4 million subscribers, who would have missed major sporting events, including key college football games and the start of the NFL season.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend a military parade in Beijing, marking his first-ever gathering with multiple foreign leaders, including China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin. The event commemorates the end of World War II and represents a significant diplomatic development, particularly as it signals a potential mending of relations between North Korea and China. This meeting occurs as Kim has been strengthening ties with Russia, including signing a mutual defense treaty.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces announced the recovery of the remains of Ilan Weiss, an Israeli hostage held in Gaza for 693 days since the October 7th attack. Weiss, a member of Kibbutz Be'eri's emergency response team, was killed and abducted by Hamas during the initial massacre. His wife, Shiri, and daughter, Noga, were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered condolences to the Weiss family and reiterated the nation's commitment to bringing all remaining hostages home. According to reports, 48 hostages remain in Gaza, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a new redistricting bill into law, redrawing the state's congressional map to significantly favor the Republican party. The new map, which could create up to five additional GOP-held districts, was passed along party lines following a weeks-long walkout by state Democrats in protest. The plan alters districts in major Democratic-leaning urban areas, including Houston, Austin, and Dallas-Fort Worth. Civil rights groups have condemned the move, with the Legal Defense Fund calling it a "shameful power grab at the expense of Black voices" and arguing it undermines the democratic process by disenfranchising minority voters.</p>

          <p>Canadian novelist Miriam Toews's new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into the profound impact of the suicides of her father and sister on her life and work. The book originated from an attempt to answer why she writes, leading her to examine how these personal tragedies shaped her into an author. Drawing inspiration from other writers, particularly poet Christian Wiman's reflections on grief, Toews explores writing as a means to continue conversations with her lost loved ones. The memoir suggests that while closure may be unattainable, literature offers a way to process the past and honor memory, serving as a vital act of survival and remembrance.</p>

Companies closely tied to housing and finance, such as Home Depot and Capital One, could see increased demand as lower borrowing costs stimulate consumer spending and the real estate market. A reduction in rates also tends to make high-yield dividend stocks, like Bristol Myers Squibb, more attractive to investors seeking returns superior to those of government bonds. Furthermore, an improved macroeconomic environment could boost Wall Street dealmaking, benefiting investment banks like Goldman Sachs through increased M&A and IPO activity.

          <p>An opinion article argues that the U.S. education system's decades-long shift away from the liberal arts in favor of STEM and vocational training has weakened American democracy. The author contends that this focus has failed to cultivate essential skills for self-government, such as critical thinking, historical literacy, and empathy, which are nurtured by the humanities. This has left the public vulnerable to propaganda and misinformation, particularly in politically charged debates over history curricula. The author calls for a restoration of the liberal arts to their central role in education to ensure citizens are prepared for the complexities of freedom and self-governance.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Americans are taking hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) plans to cover financial emergencies, a trend financial planners warn should be a last resort. Tapping retirement funds early is an expensive way to access cash, as withdrawals are subject to income tax and often a 10% penalty, while also sacrificing future compound growth. Experts recommend first using a dedicated emergency fund with three to six months of expenses. If that is not an option, alternatives like a 401(k) loan or a home equity loan are generally preferable, as they have fewer long-term negative consequences for one's retirement savings.

          <h2>Trump Administration Bypasses Congress to Cut $4.9 Billion in Foreign Aid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has informed Congress that he will not spend $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid, utilizing a rare executive maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." This process involves the president requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that Congress does not have the mandatory 45 days to act, causing the funding to expire. The move, which targets the State Department and USAID, effectively cuts the budget without legislative approval, raising concerns that it sidesteps Congress's constitutional power of the purse. This action aligns with the administration's broader policy of significantly reducing foreign aid.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees large, historic ranches, often held by families for generations, being listed for sale as heirs disagree on their future or prefer to cash out. High-end brokers report a surge in inventory of these legacy properties, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers influenced by the "Yellowstone" effect seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle. For example, the 40,000-acre Antlers Ranch in Wyoming is on the market for $85 million for the first time in five generations. This generational transfer of wealth is reshaping the market for these unique, sprawling properties across the American West.</p>

The company stated that AI-related product revenue has maintained triple-digit annual growth for eight consecutive quarters.

          <p>A long-standing trade provision known as the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, has been officially terminated by a presidential executive order.

The move is expected to increase costs for businesses and consumers, with one study estimating a potential cost of over $10 billion for U.S. families.

          <p>A recipient of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) raised concerns about whether a $1,500 car insurance payout could jeopardize their benefits. Community members and experts clarified that SSDI eligibility is based on earned income from work, not unearned income like insurance settlements, gifts, or inheritances. Unlike the needs-based Supplemental Security income (SSI) program, SSDI is an earned benefit tied to an individual's past work history and payroll tax contributions. Therefore, accepting the insurance check to repair their vehicle, which also serves as a backup home, would not affect their monthly disability payments from the SSDI program.</p>
