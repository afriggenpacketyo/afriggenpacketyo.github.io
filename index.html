          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her public testimony against her ex-husband and 50 other men who sexually assaulted her over a decade. Her bravery during the landmark trial sparked a national debate on sexual violence and contributed to legal reforms, including a new bill that incorporates the lack of consent into the criminal definition of sexual assault in France.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analyst expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to slow. He stated a firm belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. This follows two previous rate cuts this year, with the current rate at 4.25%, and comes as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended the first half of the MLB season on a high note, securing a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants. Despite an uneven performance marked by an injury-plagued pitching staff and slumping veterans, the team holds the best record in the National League and a comfortable lead in the NL West. The game encapsulated their season, with a stellar start from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto followed by a blown save, before the offense rallied in the 11th inning to secure the crucial series win.</p>

          <p>After a rocky start, England's women's football team has found its form at Euro 2025, securing a quarter-final spot with decisive wins over the Netherlands and Wales. An opening loss to France served as a wake-up call, prompting tactical adjustments from manager Sarina Wiegman that have resulted in more dominant, free-flowing football. The Lionesses are now building confidence and momentum as they prepare to face Sweden in a challenging knockout match, a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a "notably different" climate than a few decades ago, with extreme weather events becoming the new normal, according to a Met Office report. The country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency, driven by global warming. The report highlights that the UK is warming at about 0.25°C per decade and getting significantly wetter in winter, leading to more severe storms, flooding, and droughts, which in turn impact the natural world and necessitate urgent adaptation.</p>

          <p>While Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's "illiberal democracy" model has gained admirers abroad, his power is facing a significant challenge at home from the centre-right. A scandal involving a presidential pardon and the emergence of a surprise challenger, Peter Magyar, have eroded support for Orban's Fidesz party. Magyar is capitalizing on public discontent with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy, threatening Orban's long-established playbook of leveraging cultural fears, which may no longer be enough to secure victory.</p>

          <p>A decades-old water-sharing treaty between the United States and Mexico is under severe strain due to a prolonged drought in northern Mexico. Under the 1944 agreement, Mexico is required to send water from the Rio Grande to Texas, but it is currently in arrears, prompting threats of tariffs from the Trump administration. Mexican farmers in the drought-stricken state of Chihuahua argue they cannot give what they don't have, while Texan farmers insist they are being denied their rightful share, highlighting a growing conflict over a scarce resource exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended a new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a broader global strategy to onshore production and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which it deems a national security risk. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil but argued for a consistent overall strategy to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The move comes as the administration also threatens new tariffs on the EU and Mexico while continuing negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>
