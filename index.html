          <p>This article discusses the challenges Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces as he navigates the complexities of full employment and low inflation. Economists are divided on whether Powell's current strategy of inaction is the right approach, considering potential threats to both growth and inflation from President Trump's policies, including tariffs. Some experts believe the Fed is already behind the curve, potentially leading to a recession if they wait for labor market confirmation before cutting rates. The article highlights the historical context of Fed leaders being criticized for acting too slowly and the risks associated with waiting for more clarity amidst volatile economic conditions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are pushing for a "full, unconditional ceasefire" with Russia for at least 30 days, starting on Monday, as leaders from major European countries visit Kyiv. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha mentioned a "constructive" phone call between these leaders, U.S. President Trump, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, amidst ongoing violations of a unilateral Russian ceasefire. European allies view the conflict as fundamental to the continent's security and are seeking ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of potential shifts in U.S. policy, as discussions continue regarding a "coalition of the willing" to aid Ukraine's armed forces.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Maine Lobster Now has ranked New Hampshire as the top destination for pizza lovers in America, surpassing New York and Chicago. The study analyzed factors such as the number of pizzerias per capita, interest in pizza based on Google searches, and the average price of pizza in each state. New Hampshire boasts the highest number of pizzerias per 100,000 residents and a relatively affordable average pizza price, while New York ranked surprisingly low due to its high prices and lower pizzeria density.</p>

          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born businessman and founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at the age of 84. Farmer first opened a tyre business in 1964 and later established Kwik Fit in 1971, growing it into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain with over 2,000 locations in 18 countries before selling it to Ford for £1 billion in 1999.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and rapidly falling rates of family formation represent a looming demographic crisis that progressives should address rather than dismiss. The author contends that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the expected quality of life due to a smaller working population supporting a larger elderly population. Ignoring the issue due to political polarization risks ceding control of the conversation to those with distasteful politics, and the author suggests that policies supporting families, such as affordable housing and universal pre-K, could align with progressive priorities and help stabilize the population.</p>

          <p>President Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is jeopardizing his administration's ability to pass crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns about conflicts of interest stemming from Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and other crypto projects. Critics argue that these ventures create a "pay-for-play scheme" and erode public trust in government, leading to defections from key Democrats who were previously supportive of the legislation. The article suggests that Trump's personal business dealings are creating a major impediment to long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>The article examines how employers are increasingly relying on part-time labor and just-in-time scheduling to avoid paying benefits and manage costs, leading to a situation of "underwork" for many low-wage Americans. Unlike the overwork issues addressed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, many workers now struggle with inconsistent schedules and insufficient hours, making it difficult to secure loans, housing, or access social safety nets. The author proposes policy changes, such as requiring advance scheduling and incentivizing full-time employment, to address this growing problem and ensure workers have stable and predictable hours.</p>

China has increased exports, directed state-controlled banks to lend trillions to industrial borrowers, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls. While this strategy has given China leverage in its trade war with the United States, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and comes at a cost to many Chinese households, as the focus on state-led development has limited the growth and influence of private businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have initiated high-level talks in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions, marking the first known in-person contact between the two nations since President Trump imposed tariffs earlier this year. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are participating in the negotiations in Geneva, amidst a backdrop of escalating tariffs and declining trade volumes between the two countries.</p>

The article highlights concerns that European nations may lack the industrial capacity to both rearm themselves and supply Ukraine, particularly in the short term. While the U.S. has approved the transfer of American-made weapons from Germany to Ukraine, European allies are now considering how to provide the critically needed weapons, artillery and air-defense systems.</p>

          <p>A bill has been introduced that would ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances, which some experts say could help policymakers “craft effective” legislation in the future and potentially allow more clinical research on medical cannabis. If the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) passes, the law would allow research to catch up with the US’s increasing cannabis consumption. The bill repeals sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances, and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize schedule I substances.</p>

This strategy aims to directly engage the MAGA base, bypass traditional media, and dominate the "attention economy." Critics warn that the administration's reliance on insults and lies goes unchecked, while the embrace of viral far-right culture cultivates a parallel information ecosystem that challenges traditional norms of presidential behavior.</p>
