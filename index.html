          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called a rare, large-scale meeting of generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia, on short notice. This gathering follows Hegseth's earlier statements about potentially reducing the number of high-ranking officers and his efforts to rename the department. While the agenda remains undisclosed, theories suggest discussions could include the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to emphasize homeland defense. The unusual nature and scale of this in-person meeting highlight significant potential shifts in military leadership and strategic priorities under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have urged the Supreme Court to reject President Trump's request to fire her while her lawsuit challenging the removal is pending. They argue that allowing the firing would undermine the Federal Reserve Board's independence, citing "flimsy, unproven allegations" timed with Trump's criticisms of Fed policy decisions. Former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries have also supported Cook, emphasizing the importance of the 'for cause' standard for removal. The article highlights a significant legal battle over presidential power and the autonomy of a critical financial institution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of CarMax experienced a significant 20% decline, reaching a five-year low, after the used auto retailer reported quarterly earnings and revenue below Wall Street forecasts. CEO Bill Nash described the fiscal second quarter as "challenging," attributing the poor performance to changing market conditions and inventory depreciation. The company's overall vehicle sales dropped 4.1%, leading to a 28% decrease in net income. This downturn in CarMax's performance also negatively impacted other vehicle retailers, as its results are often seen as an early indicator for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>America First Legal (AFL), a group tied to President Trump, claims California lacks legal standing in its lawsuit against Trump's executive order on transgender athletes. AFL's public records requests to California agencies reportedly found no evidence of harm to transgender athletes, contradicting the state's assertion of "severe harm." This development challenges a high-profile legal case against the Trump administration, suggesting California's actions constitute "lawfare" without sufficient evidence. The California Attorney General, however, maintains commitment to defending state laws and transgender students' rights.</p>

          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced plans to close underperforming locations and eliminate 900 "nonretail" jobs as part of a $1 billion overhaul. This "Back to Starbucks" strategy aims to revitalize coffee shops and attract customers amid slowing sales and increased competition. While the exact number of closures was not specified, the company's North American store count is expected to decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025. The initiative targets locations unable to meet customer expectations or financial performance goals, including the Capitol Hill Roastery in Seattle.</p>

          <p>Authorities investigating the Dallas ICE facility shooting confirmed the suspect, Joshua Jahn, specifically targeted ICE agents, not detainees, based on notes found at his residence. Jahn's writings expressed hatred for the federal government and intent to maximize lethality against ICE personnel. Tragically, a detainee was killed and two others injured when bullets struck a transportation van. Officials believe Jahn acted alone after extensive planning, using legally obtained firearms and tracking apps. The incident has prompted heightened alert at all ICE facilities nationwide.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials are cautiously optimistic following President Trump's recent social media posts suggesting Ukraine can "take back their Country in its original form" and even "go further." This marks a notable shift from his previous stance, which often focused on ending the war quickly without clear support for a full Ukrainian victory. While some Ukrainian politicians welcome the change as a positive signal, others remain skeptical, viewing it as Trump's desire to disengage. The article explores various interpretations of Trump's evolving rhetoric and its potential implications for future US support.</p>

          <p>The National Archives and Records Administration mistakenly released a largely unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race.

The Archives acknowledged a technician failed to follow standard procedures and has apologized to Sherrill, offering identity protection.

          <p>Homeowners can now access a $75,000 home equity loan at lower monthly costs due to recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. For a 10-year loan at 8.34%, monthly payments would be around $923.49, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would cost approximately $725.86 per month. These rates are more favorable than those seen earlier in 2025 and last fall. With the average homeowner possessing substantial equity, a loan of this size can cover various expenses without overleveraging. Borrowers are encouraged to compare options carefully.
