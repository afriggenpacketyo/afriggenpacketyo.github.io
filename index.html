          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris recorded the fastest lap time during Friday's practice session for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. This performance comes at a crucial time for Norris, who is looking to close the 34-point gap to his teammate, Oscar Piastri, in the championship standings. Piastri finished fourth in the session, behind Williams' Carlos Sainz, after missing the first practice. The results set the stage for a competitive weekend as teams and drivers prepare for qualifying and the main race on Sunday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.8 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights the significant impact of state taxes on a winner's take-home prize. Winners face a mandatory 24% federal withholding, with the total federal tax bill reaching around 37%. However, state income tax rates vary widely, creating large disparities in the final payout depending on the winner's location. States like California and Florida do not tax lottery winnings, offering the largest potential payout, while states like New York have the highest tax burden, resulting in a substantially smaller prize.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has laid off nearly 100 employees in recent months, citing significant cuts in its federal funding as the primary reason for the workforce reduction. The move follows a congressional decision to eliminate $1.1 billion previously allocated to public broadcasting, forcing PBS to slash its budget by 21%. While no member stations have shut down, many are facing financial uncertainty and appealing for public support to remain operational. The layoffs underscore the severe financial strain on public media institutions amid shifting government funding priorities.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has seen a dramatic drop in ticket sales and subscription revenue since Donald Trump assumed its chairmanship. An analysis indicates that audiences are boycotting the venue in protest of his leadership, with some upcoming performances reportedly having sold less than 20% of their capacity. The downturn follows a leadership shakeup where Trump installed loyalists, including a new dance programming head critical of "leftist ideologies" in ballet. The financial slump raises serious concerns about the prestigious institution's future and artistic direction under the new management.</p>

          <p>The once-booming industrial real estate sector has experienced its first quarterly drop in demand since 2010, signaling a significant cooldown. Net absorption of industrial space fell by 11.3 million square feet in the second quarter, a stark reversal from the e-commerce-driven highs of the pandemic era. The slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty, fluctuating tariff policies, and high inflation, which have made businesses more cautious about expansion. While property sales remain steady, price appreciation has cooled, and experts predict demand will remain nearly flat for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has sanctioned three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations for their role in asking the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza. The U.S. Treasury Department listed Al-Haq, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights for engaging in efforts to prosecute Israeli nationals without Israel's consent. The sanctioned groups, which have been documenting the conflict, condemned the move as "immoral, illegal and undemocratic." The action highlights the ongoing diplomatic tensions surrounding international legal proceedings related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming at the end of September, House Republican appropriators are clashing with the Trump administration over the duration of a necessary stopgap spending bill. While lawmakers on the Appropriations Committee prefer a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to allow for proper budget negotiations, some in the administration and conservative circles are pushing for a year-long CR that would extend current funding levels. This disagreement has caused frustration among committee members, who feel their work is being undermined and that they lack clear direction from leadership, increasing the risk of a shutdown.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have continued their downward trend, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage falling to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce a reduction at its upcoming September meeting. The cooling 10-year Treasury yield has also contributed to the more favorable mortgage rates. For potential homebuyers, this trend presents an opportunity, but also signals the likelihood of increased competition in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's proposal to deploy the National Guard to high-crime cities is a politically savvy move that resonates with a public concerned about safety. The author contends that sustained Democratic leadership has failed to curb violence in cities like Chicago and Baltimore, creating a vacuum that Trump is filling with a popular law-and-order message. The piece suggests that critics who label the idea as authoritarian are defending an unpopular and failed status quo. The author frames this as an example of Trump's ability to force political opponents into defending indefensible positions on clear-cut issues.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult decision to accept President Trump's nomination to the high court. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy her family endured during a previous consideration for a vacancy, including being followed by camera crews. Barrett writes that she and her husband agreed to move forward only on the condition that they would "burn the boats," a commitment to not look back or second-guess their choice despite the anticipated hardships. She ultimately accepted out of a sense of duty to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which showed weaker-than-expected hiring in August, has all but guaranteed an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this month. The data prompted renewed criticism from the Trump administration, with Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer questioning why Fed Chair Jerome Powell is waiting to act. President Trump also stated that Powell should have lowered rates long ago. The report, indicating just 22,000 jobs were added, strengthens the case for monetary easing to stimulate a slowing economy, placing the independent central bank under significant political pressure.

          <p>The first jobs report released since President Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has confirmed a continued slowdown in U.S. hiring. The economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. The report also included a downward revision for June, which now shows a net loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly loss since 2020. This data comes amid controversy over Trump's dismissal of the former BLS commissioner and his nomination of a loyalist to lead the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peace organizations and advice centers in Germany are reporting a surge in inquiries from young people on how to avoid military service. This increase follows a new law requiring young men to register their willingness to join the army, which is seen as a first step toward reintroducing conscription, suspended since 2011. The debate is fueled by Germany's need to expand its military to meet NATO obligations amid regional security concerns. While polls show generational divides on the issue, many young people feel their voices are not being heard in a decision that could significantly impact their lives.</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report has concluded that serious human rights violations committed by all parties in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo's conflict may amount to war crimes. The investigation detailed horrific atrocities, including summary executions, torture, and systematic sexual violence by the M23 rebel group, which the report says is supported by Rwanda. The report also found that Congolese armed forces and allied pro-government militias have committed grave violations such as gang rape and the killing of civilians.

Yieldstreet recently reached a $5 million settlement with the defaulting borrowers but informed investors that this amount will not even cover its own extensive legal recovery costs. The loans, backed by ships intended for scrap metal, defaulted when Yieldstreet lost track of the collateral.
