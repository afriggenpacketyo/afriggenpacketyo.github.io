          <p>In an exclusive interview with ABC News marking his 100th day in office, President Trump addressed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration admits was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. When pressed by ABC News anchor Terry Moran, Trump conceded that he "could" facilitate Garcia's return, but also stated that Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, despite his lawyers' claims to the contrary. Trump also stated that the decision was not up to him, despite Moran pointing out that he is the president. The article highlights the conflict between the rule of law and Trump's hardline stance on immigration.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to a $202 million settlement with the U.S. government and several states over allegations of paying kickbacks to doctors to incentivize prescriptions of its HIV drugs. The payments, disguised as honoraria, meals, and travel expenses for speaker program events, allegedly violated the Anti-Kickback Statute between 2011 and 2017. According to prosecutors, this arrangement led to false claims being made to federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The settlement resolves a qui tam lawsuit filed by a physician, Dr. Paul Bellman, who will receive a portion of the settlement. The article notes that Gilead has accrued funds for the settlement and states that the company entered into this agreement to avoid the cost and distraction of potential litigation regarding this legacy compliance matter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 400 scientists involved in writing the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report summarizing climate change impacts in the U.S. The move raises concerns about the integrity and objectivity of the report, which is crucial for government and private sector climate preparedness. The administration claims the scope of the assessment is being reevaluated, aligning with Project 2025's goal to include "diverse viewpoints." This action follows earlier dismissals of USGCRP federal employees and cancellation of the contract for external NCA publication. The article highlights fears that the administration will appoint authors with alternative viewpoints on climate change, potentially undermining the report's scientific rigor.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity has contracted in April, hitting a near two-year low due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.0, below the 50-level threshold indicating contraction, for the first time since January. The decline is attributed to new tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Chinese goods, with China retaliating with its own levies. Trade flows between the two countries have been severely disrupted, as evidenced by a sharp drop in cargo ship departures from China to the U.S., resulting in a year-on-year contraction.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders walking back some tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that the levies would harm U.S. manufacturing. The changes modify the tariffs so carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum or imports from Canada and Mexico. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over two years. The article notes that even with the concessions, administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices.</p>
