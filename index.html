          <p>Top officials from the US and China held constructive talks but did not finalize an extension to their 90-day tariff truce. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that any final agreement depends on President Trump's approval, though he downplayed the risk of immediate escalation. The discussions also covered broader issues like TikTok, rare earth minerals, and China's relations with Russia and Iran. Both sides agreed to continue working towards a resolution before the August deadline to avoid a return to escalating tariffs.</p>

          <p>Amidst extreme heatwaves, the Phoenix Fire Department is successfully using a simple, low-tech solution to save lives from heatstroke. The method involves immersing victims in a large bag filled with ice and water to rapidly lower their core body temperature, a technique originally developed by the military. This cold water immersion is three to five times faster than traditional methods and has proven effective, contributing to a drop in heat-related deaths despite record temperatures. The city has now stocked ice at all fire stations and popular trailheads to make the life-saving treatment more accessible.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its intention to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save Americans billions annually. The finding, established after the Supreme Court's 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision, underpins rules on emissions from vehicles and power plants. Critics and environmental experts condemned the proposal as scientifically baseless and a threat to public health, vowing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a complex online debate, becoming a focal point for broader cultural and political anxieties. The advertisement's "genes/jeans" pun was interpreted by some as politically obtuse or even a nod to eugenics, while others defended it as harmless. This article analyzes how the controversy illustrates the fractured nature of online discourse, where genuine grievances are often stripped of context and amplified by various factions for their own purposes. The incident highlights how celebrity image, political polarization, and algorithmic attention economies converge to create self-perpetuating online spectacles.</p>

While not yet a formal famine declaration due to data access issues, the report notes that thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have been met in parts of Gaza.

          <p>The city of New Orleans has introduced the "Crescent City ID," a municipal identification program designed to help residents who face barriers to obtaining standard IDs, including migrants and the homeless. The program is seen as a supportive measure for the city's immigrant communities as the Trump administration continues to target sanctuary jurisdictions. The ID, which also allows for self-identified gender markers, will provide proof of identity and access to city services. To protect applicants, officials stated the program will store minimal personal information, a concern highlighted after a similar program in Chicago was subpoenaed by ICE.</p>

          <p>Germany is planning a significant wave of military procurement as part of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's push to strengthen its conventional armed forces. According to sources, the orders include 20 Eurofighter jets, up to 3,000 Boxer armored vehicles, and as many as 3,500 Patria infantry fighting vehicles, with a combined estimated cost of over 20 billion euros. This military overhaul is financed by an increase in the defense budget and aims to reduce reliance on the U.S. and enhance European security. The move is part of Germany's pledge to meet NATO's defense spending benchmark.</p>

          <p>The recent Manhattan shooting, where the gunman cited a belief he had CTE, underscores the complex and potentially dangerous logic of self-diagnosing the brain disease. This article explores how, because CTE can only be confirmed posthumously, the fear and ambiguity surrounding it can lead to premature conclusions. Experts note that the risk of developing CTE from only high-school level football is quite low, and symptoms like depression have many possible causes. The assumption of having an untreatable, degenerative disease can be a harmful narrative, potentially obscuring other treatable mental health issues.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious summer fruit, consuming it in excess can lead to some negative side effects, according to health experts.

Its high level of the amino acid tyramine can also trigger migraines in susceptible people.

Suggestions include outlawing children singing "Rain, rain, go away," the actions of Punxsutawney Phil, and characters like Thor and Storm from X-Men.

          <p>The mass shooting in Manhattan, carried out by a Las Vegas resident, has raised questions about Nevada's gun control laws. The gunman, Shane Tamura, legally purchased a revolver and held a concealed carry permit in the state. While Nevada has an open carry policy, it has implemented stricter measures since the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, including universal background checks for private sales and a "red flag" law. The state also prohibits firearm ownership for individuals with certain mental health adjudications, though it does not have a ban on assault-style weapons.</p>
