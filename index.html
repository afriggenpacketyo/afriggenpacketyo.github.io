With a high turnout expected, the RCN is demanding that ministers enter negotiations over the summer to improve the offer and address wider pay structures to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn.</p>

The model forecasts a substantial drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027, with countries like China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases, while U.S. exports are expected to rise. Experts note that the 15% tariff framework will cause countries to rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., impacting supply chains and potentially leading to less product diversity for American consumers as import costs increase.

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a surge in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, which offer a passport with the purchase of real estate. For as little as $200,000, buyers can gain a passport providing visa-free access to around 150 countries, with US citizens reportedly making up the majority of recent applicants. Experts suggest that political and social volatility in the U.S. is fueling the trend, as wealthy individuals seek a "plan B" passport, though the programs face scrutiny from the EU over security concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a baseline 15% tariff on most EU goods and preventing a threatened 30% rate. The deal, announced after a meeting between Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, also includes commitments for the EU to purchase hundreds of billions in US energy and invest heavily in the American economy. While averting a wider trade conflict, the agreement maintains a 50% tariff on steel and represents a compromise for the EU, which had initially hoped for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid concerns over imported pets arriving with diseases and severe behavioral issues. An investigation found that many dogs from Eastern Europe are sold online with minimal vetting, a practice described as a "Deliveroo for dogs." This article highlights rising cases of Brucella canis, a disease transmissible to humans, and stories of owners facing aggressive behavior, putting a strain on UK-based shelters that must handle the fallout from these poorly matched adoptions.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has started a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow aid agencies to use secure land routes and address the severe hunger crisis. This measure comes after months of warnings about a potential famine and global criticism over aid restrictions. While the UN and other agencies welcomed the move and began moving trucks with supplies, they reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach all civilians in need. The pause is localized, with Israel's offensive against Hamas continuing in other areas of the territory.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to perform as expected during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system could have sent a high-level "Take Action" warning to ten million people near the epicenter, but instead sent only 469, underestimating the quake's magnitude. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" alert not designed to wake people. Google has since updated its algorithms, but the failure has raised concerns about relying on such technology for public safety.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his sharp, witty, and often controversial songs in the 1950s and '60s, has passed away at the age of 97. A Harvard-educated mathematician, Lehrer led a dual life, creating iconic songs that tackled subjects like politics, pollution, and nuclear war before largely retiring from public performance to focus on teaching. His unique genre of comedy songwriting, which cleverly subverted established musical forms to deliver biting commentary, influenced generations of performers, including "Weird Al" Yankovic.</p>

He and his colleagues came face-to-face with the blood-stained killer, whose cowardly demeanor shifted when he realized the officers were not afraid, an event that has left an indelible mark on them and the community.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in Tamil Nadu, India, have ignited a fierce debate over the subcontinent's early history and become a symbol of state pride. Artifacts dating back to 580 BCE suggest a literate, urban society in southern India that was contemporaneous with civilizations in the north, challenging long-held narratives of a north-to-south cultural flow. The findings have become politicized, with Tamil leaders accusing the federal government of suppressing the site's importance, reflecting a deep-rooted cultural and political divide within India.</p>

          <p>An extraordinary investigation by a photographer and a journalist led to the discovery and return of a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used for "death flights" during Argentina's military dictatorship. The aircraft was used to push political prisoners alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By tracking down the plane in the U.S. and deciphering its flight logs, investigators were able to provide crucial, irrefutable evidence that helped convict former military officials for crimes against humanity.
