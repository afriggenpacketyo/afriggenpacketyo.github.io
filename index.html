        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. This executive action negates Zhao's November 2023 guilty plea for enabling money laundering, for which he received a four-month jail sentence in April 2024. The administration characterized the pardon as a move against the "war on cryptocurrency," noting it follows the recent commutation of George Santos's prison sentence. The decision overrides a case where federal prosecutors had originally advocated for a much harsher three-year prison term for the former crypto executive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK government inquiry into grooming gangs faces internal division, as two groups of survivors have taken opposing stances on the role of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. Following the resignation of four members from the survivors' panel who demanded Phillips also resign, another group of five survivors has written to the prime minister stating they will only continue their work if Phillips remains in her position. The disagreement centers on whether the inquiry's scope should be expanded and on trust in Phillips's leadership. This turmoil complicates the government's effort to address child sexual exploitation through the national inquiry.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance strongly criticized a preliminary vote by the Israeli parliament to advance a bill proposing the annexation of the occupied West Bank. Vance labeled the move "a very stupid political stunt" and stated he was personally insulted by the timing of the vote during his diplomatic trip. He reaffirmed that the Trump administration's policy is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also condemned the vote as a political provocation by the opposition, suggesting the bill is unlikely to pass without his party's support.</p>

          <p>Sources report that New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to endorse former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming mayoral election, with a joint appearance expected later today. This development comes after Adams ended his own tumultuous reelection campaign in September amid low polling numbers and a federal indictment that was later dropped. Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani, is currently polling second behind Mamdani. The endorsement is seen as a strategic move by Adams, an outspoken critic of Mamdani, to consolidate support behind a more moderate candidate in the contentious race.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged several individuals, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, in two separate but related illegal gambling investigations. One case involves an illegal, high-stakes poker operation allegedly tied to Mafia crime families, which used sophisticated cheating technology to defraud players. The other case centers on an illegal sports betting ring where inside information, such as a player faking an injury, was used to place lucrative prop bets on NBA games. The nationwide takedown involved 34 defendants and has exposed a sprawling criminal enterprise within the sports world.</p>

          <p>Shares of Super Micro Computer dropped by 6% after the server manufacturer announced preliminary revenue for its fiscal first quarter that fell short of expectations. The company anticipates reporting $5 billion in revenue, which is significantly below its previous guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion. Super Micro attributed the shortfall to "design win upgrades" that shifted some expected revenue into the second quarter. Despite the weak results, CEO Charles Liang stated that customer demand for AI-related products is accelerating and reiterated a full-year revenue forecast of at least $33 billion.

          <p>The British government has refused to allocate parliamentary time for a debate on Prince Andrew's royal titles and his taxpayer-funded residence, effectively halting legislative efforts to strip him of his dukedom. The decision comes amid renewed public pressure following revelations in Virginia Giuffre's memoir about his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Downing Street denied that it was blocking the debate, noting that Prince Andrew has already agreed to stop using his titles. Despite calls from the Liberal Democrats for a committee inquiry into his rent-free lease of the 30-room Royal Lodge, the government maintains that Parliament has more important issues to address.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers, particularly first-timers who constituted 30% of sales. Despite the rise in sales, the market remains challenging due to stubbornly high prices and lean inventory. The median home price was $415,200, marking a 2.1% increase from the previous year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. (not investment advice)</p>

The author recounts their own journey from progressivism to conservatism, driven by a desire for open debate and a rejection of what they perceived as a stifling, offense-averse culture in left-leaning spaces. The article suggests that campus conservatism is not primarily about loyalty to Donald Trump but rather a hunger for discourse and a reaction against the perceived dogmatism of the establishment left.

          <p>With interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, financial planners are offering guidance on how much cash to allocate to these accounts. Experts suggest that as the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher yields, though they caution against over-allocating funds that might be needed for emergencies. A common recommendation is to place 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, carefully matching the CD term lengths to specific short-to-medium-term financial goals. This strategy balances earning higher returns with maintaining liquidity for unforeseen expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

He is tasked with overseeing American's commercial strategy, loyalty program, and network planning, filling a role that has been vacant since the ousting of the former CCO in 2024 after a controversial business travel strategy backfired.</p>

          <p>A new book by journalist Jonathan Karl, titled "Retribution," reveals details about the factional infighting and controversial choices behind Donald Trump's cabinet selections. According to the book, Kristi Noem was chosen as homeland security secretary as a personal favor to former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, despite being considered "obviously unqualified" by some Trump allies. The book recounts how influential figures like Steve Bannon expressed alarm over Noem's lack of experience for such a critical national security role. The selection process is depicted as one where personal loyalty and favors often outweighed experience and qualifications for key government positions.</p>

The legislation raises the tax-free gain cap from $10 million to $15 million, lowers the required stock holding period from five to three years, and increases the asset cap for eligible businesses to $75 million. These changes mean more small businesses, particularly those structured as C corporations, can now qualify for substantial capital gains tax savings when they sell their company.

The layoffs come as Rivian contends with slower-than-expected demand, a lack of new products until next year, and significant financial losses, including a $1.1 billion loss in the second quarter.

          <p>President Trump has abruptly shifted his approach toward Russia, canceling a planned summit with Vladimir Putin and imposing new sanctions on major Russian oil companies. This move signals a change from his previous preference for diplomatic engagement, or "carrots," to a more confrontational "stick" approach. The shift appears to be driven by frustration over the Kremlin's refusal to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine, particularly its insistence on seizing the entire Donbas region. While the sanctions are unlikely to force a major policy change from Moscow, they represent a significant hardening of Washington's stance in the ongoing conflict.</p>
