          <p>A federal appeals court has extended the block of a judge's order that directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, allowing the continued deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to protect federal property and immigration agents. Trump invoked Title 10, a law that allows him to call the Guard into federal service in response to demonstrations against immigration raids. Newsom sued, arguing Trump's actions were illegal, but the appeals court sided with the administration, citing the president's broad authority in such matters, while California officials argued that Trump should have considered more "modest measures" before deploying the National Guard. The case continues to be litigated in federal court. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing legal battle and the potential for escalating tensions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled to keep the National Guard under the Trump administration's control in Los Angeles, pending the resolution of California's legal challenge, affirming the president's broad authority to deploy the military in American cities. The court, however, emphasized that this authority is not "unreviewable," disagreeing with the government's assertion that courts have no right to scrutinize the president's actions. The ruling returns the issue to a lower court, leaving unresolved the question of whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion." The court also did not address whether the Posse Comitatus Act was violated. The situation remains tense as the legal battle continues.</p>

The junta cited "irresponsible, illegal, and disloyal behavior" by Orano, which is majority-owned by the French state. This decision follows a deterioration in relations after the 2023 coup, which led to France pulling its troops from Niger.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, arguing that such conditions were "coercive" and unrelated to the purpose of transportation funding. The ruling prevents the Department of Transportation from imposing immigration enforcement conditions on grant applications, ensuring states receive funding for infrastructure maintenance and safety. The judge found no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge comes as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7%, the highest since January 2023, putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise rates. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate rice prices, which account for approximately 50% of Japan's core inflation. Analysts suggest that reduced rice prices could boost household spending if the reductions extend to processed foods and restaurant prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Trade war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending prohibitive tariffs.

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument is at risk of removal due to a legal opinion allowing presidents to revoke or shrink certain national monuments. This comes amid a movement against diversity, equity, and inclusion, with some land potentially used for mineral extraction. Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could also force the closure of over 300 park sites, including the Till monument. The monument, designated in 2023, consists of sites in Mississippi and Illinois that tell the story of Emmett Till and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

          <p>President Trump appeared to mark Juneteenth with a Truth Social post arguing that the United States has "too many non-working holidays," costing the country billions of dollars. The post did not explicitly mention Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. Mr. Trump honored Juneteenth during his first term, but has now questioned the economic impact of federal holidays. Former President Joe Biden signed a bill making Juneteenth an official federal holiday in 2021.</p>
