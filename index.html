            <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, gaining over 7% to reach $82,350.37, alongside rallies in other cryptocurrencies like Ether, dogecoin, and XRP, which saw gains exceeding 12%. The surge coincided with President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs, which sparked a broad market relief rally, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average's biggest rally in five years. Analysts suggest this pause provides a temporary sense of stability, though long-term uncertainties remain regarding trade frictions and potential dollar weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

The tariffs would levy a tax — and hike prices — on imported coffee, electronics and other goods. But perhaps no sector of the economy will be more affected by tariffs than the automotive industry, which depends on global supply chains for raw materials, parts and vehicle assembly. To combat air pollution and stem the proliferation of greenhouse gases, the California Air Resources Board adopted a rule in 2022 to require an increasing percentage of new car sales to be zero-emission vehicles over the next decade.</p>

            <p>The three Americans convicted for participating in a botched coup attempt in Congo last year have been repatriated to the United States, days after their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. The three will serve their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy. Also repatriated were Thompson, a friend of the younger Malanga who flew to Africa from Utah for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Zalman-Polun, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to halt lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firings of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Solicitor General argues that the district court orders reinstating these members harm the president and the separation of powers. The request seeks emergency relief from the high court and asks the justices to consider the constitutionality of federal laws providing removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.</p>

            <p>Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, a former Russian government minister and governor in illegally annexed Crimea, has been found guilty of breaching UK sanctions. Ovsiannikov was accused of deliberately avoiding sanctions by receiving more than £75,000 from his wife and a new Mercedes Benz SUV from his brother. The case is the first prosecution in the UK regarding a breach of sanctions under the Russia Sanctions Regulations. Ovsiannikov was sanctioned due to his senior role in illegally annexed Crimea.</p>

            <p>A panel of judges on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has vacated a lower court ruling ordering 20 federal agencies to reinstate tens of thousands of employees they had fired. The decision further clears the way for the Trump administration to re-fire, for now, probationary employees. Those are typically federal workers in their first or second year on the job, or who have been recently promoted into new roles. It's unclear how quickly agencies might move to re-fire probationary employees.</p>

            <p>The US Treasury Department claimed Wednesday that China and Mexico are the leading players in a robust and sophisticated global financial system supporting the fentanyl trade. The report includes a resilient and shadowy network of wire transfers, social media marketing, casinos, cash transactions, money laundering, e-commerce, call centres and illegal online pharmacies, all to finance the deadly opioid trade. Its release comes less than three months into a second Donald Trump administration that cited fentanyl trafficking as justification for tariffs it placed on China, Mexico and Canada.</p>

            <p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos Britannia sailing team has abandoned its challenge for the next America's Cup. It blamed "a protracted negotiation" with Athena Racing - the team of Ineos' former skipper Sir Ben Ainslie. Ainslie, 48, had a strained relationship with Manchester United co-owner Ratcliffe regarding plans for the 38th America's Cup, which prompted them to part ways. Ineos had planned to compete under the Britannia name, but Ainslie's Athena Racing team said they were "astounded" by the move, and it raised "significant legal and practical obstacles".</p>
