          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant downturn, and U.S. stock futures faced selling pressure due to investor concerns about the economic repercussions of the Trump administration's tariffs. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index saw a substantial drop, and indices in Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea also suffered considerable losses. President Trump's recent tariff announcements, including a minimum 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and reciprocal levies on nearly 90 countries, have sparked fears of a global trade war and potential economic slowdown. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to increased inflation, reduced consumer spending, and overall harm to economic growth. (not investment advice)

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's tariff announcement, with major indices in Shanghai, Tokyo, Sydney, and Hong Kong all plummeting. The region is particularly vulnerable to the impact of a potential global trade war, as many Asian countries rely heavily on exports. Goldman Sachs has increased its forecast of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months, citing concerns about tariffs and their potential impact on economic growth. A significant slowdown in the U.S. economy would have major repercussions for Asian exports, as the U.S. is a crucial market for goods from the region. (not investment advice)

          <p>Following President Trump's tariff announcements, investors are turning to safe-haven assets, with analysts highlighting the Japanese yen and Swiss franc as strong candidates. The Japanese yen is considered a good hedge due to its low cost, potential decline in U.S. interest rates, and relatively lower reliance on trade. The Swiss franc is another viable option, though uncertainty surrounds the Bank of Japan's rate hikes. Bonds and gold are also attracting investors seeking to mitigate the impact of tariffs amid market volatility. (not investment advice)

          <p>A new WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, highlighting the devastating impact of inadequate resources and support. The report warns that the global target for reducing maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed by a significant margin, and that recent cuts to international aid by the US and UK governments risk reversing progress made. Sub-Saharan Africa and India experience the highest maternal mortality rates, with Nigeria accounting for a substantial portion of global deaths. Health organizations emphasize the need for increased investment, political commitment, and skilled midwives to prevent these preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill in New York aims to restrict police traffic stops for minor violations to promote "racial equity and public safety." The legislation would prohibit officers from pulling over drivers for infractions like a broken taillight or expired registration, intending to reduce unnecessary stops and address racial disparities in arrests and traffic stops. Critics argue that the proposal would hinder law enforcement's ability to enforce traffic laws and could make roads less safe. The debate centers on balancing the need for equitable policing practices with concerns about public safety and effective law enforcement.</p>

Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's protégé, accused judges of attempting to silence the opposition, while counter-rallies led by left-wing parties warned against U.S.-style authoritarianism in France. The gathering highlighted the deep divisions within France over justice, power, and the role of the far right in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Sir Jackie Stewart recounted the emotional moment his wife forgot who he was, as his charity funds a new dementia blood test. Lady Helen, diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2014, experiences significant behavioral and language changes. Stewart founded Race Against Dementia to fund research, including a University of Cambridge trial for a blood test to detect signs of dementia decades before it develops. The study aims to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis and potential interventions, highlighting the importance of research and support for families affected by dementia.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is targeting US universities through financial attacks, impacting academic freedom and freedom of speech, argues Cas Mudde. He proposes four ways for the international community to help: academics can host targeted data and research, journalists can be sensitive in interviews, universities can offer structural support, and governments can integrate initiatives into broader strategies for European academia. The goal is to support academics facing political pressure and ensure the continuation of research and academic freedom.</p>
