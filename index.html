        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The move raises legal and practical questions, as there is no domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign groups, and antifa lacks a formal, hierarchical structure. The announcement was praised by some Republican senators who have previously called for such a designation. Legal experts note that labeling a domestic group in this manner is unprecedented and faces significant First Amendment hurdles.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil to either Syria or Algeria, citing his failure to disclose certain affiliations on his green card application. The judge ruled that Khalil deliberately omitted his internship with UNRWA and his ties to a campus anti-Israel coalition, which federal authorities argue are politically sensitive and raise national security concerns. Khalil, who was previously arrested by ICE and detained for several months, has framed the government's actions as retaliation for his political speech. His legal team has announced plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has formed a coalition with over 40 conservative organizations, including the America First Policy Institute and The Heritage Foundation, to create civics education content. The initiative, named the America 250 Civics Education Coalition, aims to renew patriotism and promote a shared understanding of America's founding principles in schools. This move comes as the Trump administration works to reduce the federal role in education, raising questions about potential influence over school curricula, which is legally prohibited at the federal level.</p>

Other markets across the Asia-Pacific region had a mixed response, with South Korea's Kospi rising while indexes in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Australia saw declines. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of further reductions possible this year, influencing investor sentiment globally as the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom included a lavish state banquet at Windsor Castle, a meticulously planned event designed to showcase diplomatic hospitality. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, such as Apple's Tim Cook and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, rather than celebrities. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales, with other prominent UK and US officials strategically positioned. The event blended historical grandeur with modern diplomacy, featuring music reportedly chosen from the president's own favorites.</p>

In his monologue, Kimmel had criticized what he called the "MAGA gang" for attempting to score political points from the killing.

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the Trump administration's efforts to dismiss the threats of climate change. The report states that the evidence for human-caused global warming is "beyond scientific dispute" and unequivocally confirms the validity of the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat. This scientific consensus directly contradicts the EPA's recent moves to revoke the finding, a decision the agency has justified by citing regulatory costs. The report underscores that scientific certainty has only increased since 2009.</p>

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content in fruits commonly eaten by the primates and calculated their daily intake, which amounts to a steady, low dose of ethanol. This finding lends support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits routinely consumed by wild chimps.</p>

This contrasts with the Republican plan, which would fund the government until November 21 and includes security funding but omits the health subsidies. With Republicans advancing their bill in the House, the competing proposals set the stage for intense negotiations to avoid a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has recommended against scrapping the current system of individual care plans for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The Education Select Committee's report calls for keeping the existing Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The report also urges the government to establish new national minimum standards for SEND support in all schools and to increase investment in teacher training and specialist schools. This comes as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been described as financially unsustainable.</p>

The board president praised his steady leadership during challenging times, citing recent improvements in student test scores. The extension provides stability for the district as it faces ongoing challenges, including long-term financial pressures and supporting a large population of immigrant students.</p>

          <p>According to a new report, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States, tied with Louisiana at 17.7%. This figure, which accounts for the state's high cost of living, means about 7 million residents cannot afford basic necessities. The research from the California Budget and Policy Center notes that poverty rates surged after pandemic-era support programs, such as the expanded child tax credit, expired. The report highlights that people of color, renters, and children are disproportionately affected and warns that recent state and federal budget cuts could exacerbate the problem.</p>

This effort is part of a broader right-wing campaign to punish critics, which has reignited debates over cancel culture and free speech.

The visit included a lavish banquet at Windsor Castle and a military welcome, aimed at strengthening the "special relationship" and fostering economic ties. While the British government hopes the visit will secure investment and trade benefits, thousands of protesters marched in London to voice their opposition. The day focused on ceremony, with substantive political and trade discussions scheduled to take place later with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

Trump had posted that the state was in the final stages of approving such housing in the affluent area, which was affected by a major firestorm in January. However, Newsom's office clarified that both the governor and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had issued orders banning new duplex and lot-split applications in the burn zone.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move seen as a middle path between stimulating a weakening job market and controlling inflation. This modest reduction is unlikely to appease President Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the central bank for more significant cuts and has taken steps to assert influence over the institution. The article details the administration's attempts to oust a Biden-appointed governor and the unusual appointment of a White House economic adviser to the Fed board. These actions test the Fed's long-standing independence and create tension between political demands and long-term economic strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to its lowest level in over two years. With UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. The decision comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently cut its own rates, highlighting differing economic conditions and policy approaches between the two countries.</p>
