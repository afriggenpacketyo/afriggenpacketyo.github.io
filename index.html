          <p>A new BBC interactive tool, "Cooler Than Me?", invites users to explore Britain's national pastime of complaining about the weather by comparing local forecasts with cities across the world. This innovative feature allows individuals to determine if other regions genuinely experience better climatic conditions or if the UK is indeed a "green and pleasant land," fostering a deeper understanding of global meteorological variations. The article highlights how this engaging platform not only offers a unique perspective on weather patterns but also encourages users to become amateur meteorologists by actively utilizing the BBC Weather website. This playful yet informative approach provides a fresh and insightful look into how personal weather experiences stack up against those in different parts of the globe.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport experienced its second closure in 24 hours due to unconfirmed drone sightings, causing significant flight disruptions and affecting thousands of passengers. This incident unfolded as Germany celebrated its 35th German Unity Day, a major public holiday, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron delivering speeches that underscored democracy's global challenges and the imperative for European unity. Merz also highlighted domestic concerns like irregular migration and global economic shifts, while discussions revisited the €2 trillion cost of reunification, which spurred an economic miracle. The German interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, called the repeated drone incidents a "wake-up call" for increased national and European funding for drone defense and research.</p>

          <p>A new defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan presents a significant nuclear dilemma for China, which maintains strong relations with both nations and a long-standing collaboration with Riyadh on its civilian nuclear program. Analysts suggest Beijing is cautious about further developing this nuclear partnership to avoid provoking the U.S. or giving the impression of encouraging nuclear proliferation in the region. A senior Saudi official's comment that the pact would "encompass all military means" has intensified concerns, especially given the widespread belief in Israel's "nuclear monopoly." This situation is further complicated by Riyadh's reported unease with America's perceived reluctance to protect its allies, prompting a re-evaluation of regional security dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to set the refugee admissions cap at a record-low 7,500 people for the upcoming fiscal year, a drastic reduction from the previous administration's 125,000. This controversial policy prioritizes white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity, based on claims of racial discrimination and violence that South Africa's government has rejected. The proposed cap reflects President Trump's restrictive immigration views and aligns with his broader crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration during his previous term. Critics, including the Refugee Council USA, argue that such a low limit jeopardizes people’s lives, separates families, and undermines national security and economic growth, urging elected officials to push for more humanitarian admissions.</p>

          <p>After two years, a breakthrough in Gaza peace negotiations appears imminent, largely attributed to President Donald Trump's unorthodox and decisive diplomatic style.

This move places Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a difficult position, marking a significant shift in US-Israel relations. Trump's pragmatic approach, driven by a desire for a deal and a Nobel Peace Prize, leverages broad international support for ending the conflict, especially after an Israeli attack in Qatar angered his administration.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces secured a narrow 89-86 victory over the Phoenix Mercury in Game 1 of the WNBA finals, staging a powerful fourth-quarter comeback led by MVP A'ja Wilson and reserve guard Dana Evans. This intense game, featuring 12 lead changes, highlighted the competitive nature of the first-ever best-of-seven WNBA finals series. Off-court, the league faced significant tension as Commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed player unrest, with union vice-president Napheesa Collier accusing her of dismissing concerns over pay and officiating. This backdrop of mistrust, particularly with the collective bargaining agreement expiring soon, adds a layer of complexity to the season's premier event.</p>

          <p>A new University of Oxford study reveals that changing weather patterns, particularly extreme temperatures, caused 1,700 heat-related deaths in Zurich between 1969 and 2018, with numbers rapidly increasing despite modern healthcare. Dr. Rupert Stuart-Smith emphasizes that "more people are dying than ever before because of climate change," advocating for rapid and sustained emission reductions by transitioning away from fossil fuels and animal agriculture. While heat resilience methods like staying indoors have saved lives, vulnerable populations and wildlife remain at high risk.

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' 50-month prison sentence for prostitution-related offenses, his legal team announced plans to appeal, arguing the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted. Lead attorney Teny Geragos stated the judge "acted as a 13th juror" by focusing on sex trafficking and RICO counts despite the jury's not-guilty verdict on those charges. While acknowledging the indefensible domestic violence captured on video, the defense contends the lengthy sentence contradicts the goal of rehabilitation and that Combs has been sufficiently punished by his year in prison and reputational damage. The appeal will center on the argument that the sentence was disproportionately driven by rejected allegations.</p>

          <p>Retained firefighters in the UK, who served for decades as on-call emergency responders, are still awaiting their rightful pensions despite a 2015 settlement and a European Court of Justice ruling extending eligibility. Many, like 78-year-old Roger Dunton, express profound frustration over the persistent delays, with some also advocating for the widows of former colleagues who passed away before receiving their entitlements. The Fire Brigades Union attributes this "complex matter" to administrative issues exacerbated by budget cuts, while the West Yorkshire Pension Fund acknowledges the challenge of processing a "large number of cases" with complex, multi-year pay information. This ongoing battle underscores the significant commitment of these dedicated firefighters and the systemic difficulties in securing their earned retirement benefits.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a measure allowing over 800,000 rideshare drivers to unionize as independent contractors, marking a significant expansion of private-sector collective bargaining rights. This legislation, a compromise between labor unions and tech companies like Uber and Lyft, enables drivers to negotiate for better wages and benefits while remaining contractors. In exchange, Newsom is expected to approve a measure cutting the companies' insurance requirements for underinsured driver accidents, potentially saving them hundreds of millions. The law represents a different approach from federal policies under President Trump, aiming to empower workers and lower costs for riders in California.</p>

An amber wind warning is in place for northern and western Scotland, with warnings of potential power cuts and life-threatening flying debris. A yellow warning covers wider areas, including Northern Ireland, Wales, and northwest England. The storm has already caused the death of a man in the Republic of Ireland and led to widespread travel disruptions, including suspended rail services and ferry cancellations. As the storm moves north, high winds and heavy rain are expected to continue, gradually easing by Saturday.</p>

          <p>The first Riyadh Comedy Festival has sparked controversy, featuring prominent comedians like Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr performing explicit jokes about sex and trans people, which surprised audiences in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia. While attendees reported an enthusiastic reception for the "profane content," human rights groups criticized the festival as an attempt by the Saudi regime to "whitewash" its abuses, especially coinciding with the anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Comedians have been accused of "selling out" for large fees, with some contracts reportedly banning material critical of the royal family. This event highlights Saudi Arabia's efforts to diversify its economy and image, clashing with its human rights record.</p>

Kevin Evers, author of "The Strategic Genius of Taylor Swift," notes her focus on giving fans maximum value, recognizing that streaming generates less income than merchandise and physical variants.

          <p>Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Emergency Relief for Federal Workers Act to support federal employees facing financial hardship during the ongoing government shutdown, which he attributes to President Trump and congressional Republicans. The bill aims to allow federal workers to withdraw funds from their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement accounts without penalty, and to recontribute them later, addressing a common issue in past shutdowns where employees faced penalties for accessing their savings. It also proposes suspending TSP loan payments during shutdowns and deducting outstanding payments from back pay provided after the government reopens. This legislation seeks to mitigate the severe financial strain on tens of thousands of federal workers across the country.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants, freezing a lower court decision that found the termination illegal. This ruling allows the administration to proceed with rolling back protections that permitted Venezuelans to live and work in the U.S. without fear of immediate deportation. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented, with Jackson criticizing the decision as "yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket" that will "disrupt as many lives as possible." The Department of Homeland Security hailed the order as a "win for the American people," while advocates condemned it as heartbreaking and potentially leading to mass injuries and deportations.</p>

VCL claims it needs more customers to charter a ship and denies scamming anyone, citing administrative reasons for withholding refunds and threatening legal action against complainants.

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles (BEV) growing by almost a third and plug-in hybrids even faster. Electrified vehicles now account for over half of all new car registrations last month, driven by carmaker discounts, increased model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme. While 71.4% of BEVs were bought by businesses, private buyer numbers have risen, and zero-emission vehicles constitute over one in five new cars registered in 2025. This growth, despite economic impacts and cyberattacks affecting the broader car industry, signals a positive trend towards sustainable transportation, though consumer demand still "trails ambition."</p>

Newly released court records reveal Fatherly pressed his knee into Adair's back for 86 seconds while Adair, suffering from a severely injured leg and schizophrenia, was on his stomach in a jail cell. Adair, arrested for misdemeanor traffic violations, repeatedly cried "Help!" before ceasing movement. The autopsy ruled his death a homicide due to "mechanical asphyxia."

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily self-deport, according to a memo obtained by The Guardian. This initiative, which excludes Mexican minors, marks a significant departure from established immigration policy for children. Advocates and immigration lawyers express alarm, citing concerns about exploiting vulnerable minors, undermining legal rights, and potentially fueling family separations. They question how children can consent to such a legally complex decision and worry about pressures to accept the offer to protect family members. This policy is viewed as part of a "sustained assault on children's access to legal counsel" and raises ethical concerns about incentivizing removal.</p>
