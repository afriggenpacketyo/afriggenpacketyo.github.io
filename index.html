          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has launched an investigation into the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the Department of Education, expressing concerns about the potential impact on students, parents, and teachers. Warren sent letters to civil rights groups and educational organizations, seeking information on how abolishing the department could affect access to affordable, high-quality public education. She criticizes the administration's plan as a "reckless crusade" that could jeopardize funding for students with disabilities, civil rights protections, and federal financial aid. The investigation comes as roughly 2,000 department employees have been separated from the agency.</p>

          <p>China has refuted claims made by U.S. President Trump regarding active negotiations over tariffs, asserting that any suggestion of progress is unfounded. A Ministry of Commerce spokesman emphasized that consultations must occur on a basis of mutual respect and equality, calling for the complete cancellation of all unilateral tariffs imposed by the United States. This statement follows Trump's earlier remarks about potentially reducing tariffs on Chinese exports, creating confusion in the market. China has previously responded to U.S. tariffs with retaliatory measures, including restricting rare earth mineral exports and raising cases against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.</p>

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has finalized rules requiring tech firms to implement stronger protections for children online. These rules mandate changes to algorithms that recommend content to young users and the introduction of robust age verification measures by July 25th, with platforms hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm facing stricter requirements. The regulator views this as a "gamechanger," while critics argue the measures don't go far enough. Platforms must adapt their services to offer different experiences for children versus adults, with legal consequences for non-compliance, as Ofcom seeks to prioritize the safety and well-being of young internet users.</p>

          <p>Unpredictable US trade policies could incentivize countries to fortify their relationships with China as a safeguard against instability, according to a trade policy expert at the Brookings Institution. Joshua Meltzer suggests that this trend of seeking alternatives to mitigate exposure to U.S. uncertainty will persist in the near term. He notes that China is likely to capitalize on this situation by positioning itself as the preferred alternative partner for various nations. The ultimate outcome, however, will depend on whether the Trump administration manages to stabilize its trade policies.</p>

The increased cost of materials, such as pipes from Asian markets, is making business more expensive, and fears of a recession are dampening optimism for higher profits. Some executives believe that the tariff situation will backfire on Trump, as lower oil prices due to a weakened economy would discourage new drilling.

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of massive icebergs, comparable in size to cities, that once roamed the coasts of the UK, leaving deep scratch marks on the North Sea floor. These findings suggest that the ice sheet covering Britain and Ireland produced ice shelves, which are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend into the ocean. The study of these ancient icebergs could provide valuable insights into how climate change is affecting Antarctica today, particularly regarding the stability of ice shelves and their impact on sea-level rise. The research reveals an abrupt shift in iceberg production around 18,000 years ago, coinciding with accelerated glacial retreat.</p>

          <p>Racial disparities in youth incarceration are at their widest point in decades, with Black children nearly six times more likely to be incarcerated than white children, and American Indian children nearly four times more likely. Experts attribute this disparity to factors such as increased policing in minority neighborhoods and unequal access to diversion programs. Despite overall youth incarceration rates being lower than in previous decades, the children who remain in detention are disproportionately children of color, who also tend to stay in detention longer. These disparities have lasting consequences, including reduced educational attainment and increased likelihood of future arrests.</p>

          <p>Indonesia plans to increase imports from the United States in an effort to reduce its trade surplus, following the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati indicated that Indonesia is looking to import more agricultural products, such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, as well as oil and gas, particularly liquid gas, from the U.S. This move comes as Indonesia's trade surplus with the U.S. has increased, and the country seeks to negotiate the extent of duties levied on its exports. The strategy reflects a broader trend of countries adjusting trade relationships in response to U.S. tariff policies.</p>
