          <p>California officials have identified a deceased Navy diver, Sean Patrick McNulty, as the perpetrator in a series of home invasion and sexual assault cold cases from the 1980s and 90s. Using DNA evidence and investigative genealogy, authorities connected McNulty, who died by suicide in 1997, to crimes in California, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. The breakthrough provides long-awaited answers and a measure of closure for victims, with investigators now working to notify them and determine if McNulty was involved in other unsolved crimes.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, holders of maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable savings climate. Financial experts suggest exploring several options instead of automatically rolling over funds into a new, lower-rate CD. These alternatives include high-yield savings accounts, which offer competitive rates and greater flexibility, and money market accounts that combine high interest with checking features. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD for extended security. (not investment advice)</p>

Alternatively, the story could persist as a background issue without causing significant political damage, or it could eventually fade from public attention if no new revelations surface, a pattern Trump has successfully navigated in past scandals.</p>

Regulators accused the tech giant of engaging in "self-preferencing" by boosting its own ad exchange, AdX, to the detriment of rivals, which led to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, arguing the changes required will harm European businesses.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conducted a major cabinet reshuffle after Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner resigned over a tax error related to a house purchase. David Lammy has been appointed as the new deputy prime minister and justice minister, while Yvette Cooper takes his former role as foreign minister.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats are ineffectively using Donald Trump's past association with Jeffrey Epstein as a universal explanation for his controversial actions, labeling everything a "distraction" from the Epstein files. The author contends that this strategy dilutes the seriousness of Trump's more authoritarian behaviors and reveals a lack of a potent opposition message. By constantly redirecting focus to Epstein, Democrats may be inadvertently downplaying other significant issues and failing to motivate voters on more substantive grounds.</p>

          <p>As the Reform UK party gains political momentum, its economic plans are facing increased scrutiny. This analysis from BBC Verify examines the party's key proposals, including significant tax cuts, increased public spending, and the complete abandonment of net-zero carbon emission targets. Experts question the feasibility of the party's claim that it can fund these changes by cutting government waste, suggesting that such deep cuts would likely require substantial reductions in public services.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, potential winners face a significant tax bill that will substantially reduce their take-home prize. The winner can choose between an annuity or a lump sum of approximately $826.4 million, but both options are subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding upfront. Because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax payment will be due, in addition to any applicable state taxes.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta had sued the city, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. In addition to repealing the ordinance, Norwalk will dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies, ending a standoff where city leaders had argued they were unfairly burdened with regional homelessness issues.</p>

States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to take home a larger portion of the jackpot after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceedingly slim at 1 in 292.2 million.
