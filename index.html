          <p>The Co-op grocery chain anticipates that its shelves will be more fully stocked this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a recent cyberattack. The attack, claimed by a group called DragonForce, disrupted the company's online ordering system, leading to payment problems and shortages. The Co-op is gradually restoring its systems and working with suppliers to restock both in-store and online. Cyber security experts suggest that the attack will erode public trust in online services, leading to consumers being more cautious when sharing personal and financial information.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would remove all sanctions on Syria, stating his desire to give the country a chance at greatness. He highlighted the new Syrian government's potential to stabilize the country and maintain peace, noting that his administration had already begun restoring normal relations with Syria. The sanctions, initially imposed in 2004 and strengthened in 2011, had significantly hindered Syria's economic progress and humanitarian aid efforts following a devastating earthquake in 2023.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, opening the door for their potential release after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents.

          <p>The UK government plans to relocate thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The goal is to reduce the number of roles in London by 12,000 and close 11 offices, saving £94 million annually by 2032. Two new government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with additional roles created in other cities. The government aims to have 50% of senior civil servants based in regional offices by 2030 and wants to embrace new technology, while still expecting employees to be in the office at least 60% of the time.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has fired two top members of the National Intelligence Council, Acting Chair Mike Collins and Deputy Chair Maria Langan-Riekhof. Gabbard is also transferring the NIC from under the CIA to her office. According to an ODNI spokesperson, the Director is working alongside President Trump to end the weaponization and politicization of the Intelligence Community. Last month, Gabbard announced on social media she had “referred two intelligence community LEAKS to the Department of Justice for criminal referral, with a third criminal referral on its way, which includes the recent illegal leak to the Washington Post.”</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is creating uncertainty in the U.S. renewable energy sector through tariffs and anti-renewable rhetoric. Proposed tariffs on Southeast Asia could significantly impact solar energy, while efforts to stop funding already approved green energy projects and potential repeals of parts of the Inflation Reduction Act are also concerning. Despite these challenges, experts predict that the clean energy sector will continue to grow, but at a slower pace. The US may face competition globally as countries move away from fossil fuels.</p>
