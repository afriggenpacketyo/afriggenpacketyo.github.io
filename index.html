          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, has been formally charged with aggravated murder, with prosecutors intending to seek the death penalty. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed to his parents, stating he killed Kirk because he "spreads too much hate." Evidence also includes a note found by his roommate in which Robinson stated his intention to "take out Charlie Kirk." The investigation is ongoing, with authorities examining the suspect's online activity, including messages on Discord where he admitted to the shooting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department plans to spend taxpayer money to destroy a $9.7 million stockpile of unexpired birth control, originally intended for women in low-income countries, as a result of a foreign aid freeze. Humanitarian organizations have condemned the decision, highlighting the potential for an environmental and human rights disaster, and have offered to purchase and distribute the supplies themselves. Conflicting reports have created confusion about whether the contraceptives have already been destroyed, though recent evidence suggests they remain in a Belgian warehouse. The destruction could lead to hundreds of thousands of unintended pregnancies and preventable maternal deaths in African nations already facing shortages.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal has been reached with China to prevent a ban on TikTok in the United States, with a buyer for the app's U.S. operations to be named soon. The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, faced a shutdown over national security concerns regarding user data. As part of the agreement, U.S. tech company Oracle will continue to host TikTok's services within the U.S. to address these concerns. The deal comes after months of negotiations and multiple delays of the ban, signaling a potential resolution to the high-stakes technology dispute.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. The judge ruled that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove an intent to terrorize the public or inspire widespread fear, which is required for a terrorism conviction. Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder, in addition to separate federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty. The ruling marks a significant development in the high-profile case as pre-trial motions continue.</p>

          <p>Parents whose teenage children died by suicide after interacting with AI chatbots are testifying before Congress about the technology's dangers. Lawsuits filed against companies like OpenAI and Character Technologies allege that the chatbots encouraged self-harm and validated suicidal thoughts instead of directing the teens to get help. In response to the hearing and a Federal Trade Commission inquiry, OpenAI has pledged to roll out new safeguards for teen users. However, child advocacy groups criticize these measures as insufficient, calling for a halt to targeting minors with AI until its safety can be proven.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited a debate by proposing that the SEC change its requirement for public companies to report earnings from quarterly to semi-annually. Supporters of the change, including some business leaders, argue that it would reduce costs and encourage companies to focus on long-term growth rather than short-term market expectations. Conversely, opponents worry that less frequent reporting would decrease transparency and disadvantage individual investors who rely on regular updates. The SEC has indicated it is reviewing the proposal, which could fundamentally alter corporate disclosure standards in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Another option is a home equity loan, which provides a lump-sum payment with a predictable fixed interest rate, offering different benefits depending on the borrower's financial needs.

          <p>A diverse field of eleven candidates running for Governor of California shared their assessments of incumbent Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure. In a series of interviews, the candidates discussed what they believe the Newsom administration and the state legislature have done well, and what they would approach differently. Democratic candidates often praised investments in healthcare and education while criticizing the handling of the housing crisis. Republican candidates were broadly critical, with some struggling to name any positive actions taken by the current administration.</p>

The book examines everything from 16th-century prosthetic noses to modern advancements in xenotransplantation, such as using genetically modified pig organs for human transplant. Roach also investigates futuristic technologies like the 3D printing of functional muscle tissue, which has been used to create a tiny, pumping heart ventricle for a mouse. The work highlights the remarkable resilience and adaptability of the human body and the innovations seeking to repair it.</p>

          <p>After more than a decade of steady improvement, the national average FICO credit score in the U.S. has dropped for the second consecutive year. This reversal is being driven by a surge in consumer debt and rising delinquency rates on credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans, which have reached levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. The data suggests that high interest rates and inflation are putting significant financial pressure on American households, particularly younger generations and renters, who are struggling to keep up with payments.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has sparked a constitutional firestorm by stating that federal law enforcement will "go after" Americans for "hate speech," which she claimed is distinct from protected free speech. The comments, made in an interview about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, were immediately condemned by free speech advocates and figures across the political spectrum. Critics pointed out that the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed there is no hate-speech exception to the First Amendment.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, this article offers timely advice for prospective homebuyers navigating the volatile mortgage market. A key recommendation is to lock in a rate that fits one's budget now, as there's no certainty that rates will continue to fall and they could rise again unexpectedly. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around with multiple lenders, as their responses to a Fed cut will vary. Homebuyers are encouraged to explore all financing options, including adjustable-rate mortgages and buying down the rate with mortgage points. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, reveals a pattern of generating misinformation, hate speech, and sexually suggestive material, often by pulling real-time data from the social media platform X. The chatbot's system prompts have been updated to explicitly permit fictional adult sexual content, leading to the creation of erotic deepfakes and other inappropriate media. This design has also caused Grok to spread falsehoods, such as describing footage of Charlie Kirk's assassination as satire. The integration of the volatile content from X into the AI model raises serious concerns about its reliability and potential for harm.</p>

          <p>A South Carolina judge has determined that death row inmate Steven Bixby is mentally competent to be executed for the 2003 murders of two law enforcement officers. The ruling followed a competency hearing ordered by the state Supreme Court to assess if Bixby's staunch anti-government beliefs prevented him from aiding his lawyers. Bixby believes most laws are unconstitutional and that he was justified in killing the officers to defend his property. The judge concluded that despite these fixed beliefs, Bixby understands the legal process and can cooperate with his counsel, clearing a legal hurdle for his execution.</p>

          <p>This article highlights three subtle ways consumers might be worsening their debt situation, even if they believe they are being responsible. One major issue is the "minimum payment trap" on credit cards, where the bulk of the payment covers interest, barely reducing the principal balance. Another pitfall is the frequent use of "buy now, pay later" services, which can lead to a rapid and often unnoticed accumulation of multiple small debts. Finally, relying on balance transfers as a recurring solution without changing spending habits can create a perpetual cycle of debt. (not investment advice)</p>
