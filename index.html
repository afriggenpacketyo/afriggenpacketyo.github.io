          <p>NATO has intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated Estonian airspace for 12 minutes, an incident Estonia's foreign ministry labeled "unprecedentedly brazen." The Russian aircraft had their transponders off and lacked flight plans, prompting the deployment of Finnish and Italian jets to escort them out. This incursion, the fourth by Russia into Estonia this year, has led Estonia to request NATO Article 4 consultations and has drawn condemnation from top EU officials who vow a determined response to escalating Russian provocations. The event highlights rising tensions along NATO's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>A short-term government funding bill passed by the Republican-led House failed to advance in the Senate, leaving no clear path to avoid a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The GOP measure, which would fund the government until November 21, was blocked by Senate Democrats who oppose the lack of negotiation on their priorities, particularly healthcare. With lawmakers leaving Washington for a recess, the stalemate intensifies pressure on both parties. Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated another vote will occur upon their return, while President Trump acknowledged a shutdown is a distinct possibility.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has banned the Irish-language hip-hop group Kneecap from entering the country, canceling their scheduled tour dates in Toronto and Vancouver. Officials cited the group's alleged amplification of political violence and public support for organizations like Hezbollah, which Canada considers a terrorist group. The ban is linked to terror offense charges filed in the UK against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh for displaying a pro-Hezbollah flag. Kneecap has denounced the Canadian government's statements as "deeply malicious" and untrue, announcing their intent to pursue legal action in response to the ban.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 4,000 Syrian immigrants, arguing that conditions in their home country no longer prevent their safe return. The Department of Homeland Security stated that continuing the humanitarian program is not in the national interest, citing past terrorist activity in Syria. Syrians enrolled in the program will have approximately 60 days to find an alternative legal status or face deportation, with the administration advising them to self-deport. This action is part of a broader effort to dismantle TPS programs for numerous countries, which immigrant advocates have challenged in court.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party marketplace. The report found that as Walmart rapidly expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, it relaxed its seller vetting processes, leading to an influx of bad actors using stolen business identities to sell fake goods. Tests conducted on 20 products purchased from these fraudulent sellers confirmed all were counterfeit, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly tightened its vetting requirements for sellers in the health and beauty categories.</p>

This contrasts with letters from previous presidents, including Biden, Obama, and both Bushes, which emphasized America as an "idea" or an "experiment" based on principles like equality and individual rights.

          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion that his administration could revoke broadcast licenses of TV stations critical of him has highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has echoed Trump's threats, particularly in relation to Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments.

          <p>Pattern Group, a leading third-party seller on Amazon, made its public debut on the Nasdaq, with its stock closing up 11% on its first day of trading. The e-commerce accelerator, which helps brands like Nestle and Panasonic optimize sales on online marketplaces, raised $300 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $2.5 billion. Pattern's successful offering is another positive sign for the tech IPO market, which has seen a resurgence after a prolonged quiet period. The company's prospectus acknowledges risks related to its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform and potential impacts from international trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to introduce a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications as part of a broader immigration crackdown targeting the program for highly skilled foreign workers. This significant fee increase would primarily affect technology companies like Amazon and Google, which rely on the program to hire specialized talent. The H-1B program has been criticized by some for enabling companies to hire foreign workers at lower wages than their American counterparts. The move is expected to be formalized through a presidential proclamation and will accompany a new rule-making process to update wage-level requirements.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's warnings to ABC regarding Jimmy Kimmel, comparing his rhetoric to that of a mob boss. On his podcast, Cruz said Carr's suggestion that the network could face consequences for Kimmel's comments was "dangerous as hell" and akin to a mafioso's veiled threat. While stating he was glad Kimmel faced repercussions, Cruz warned against the government using its power to silence media voices it dislikes, arguing such actions would ultimately harm conservatives. The critique places Cruz at odds with President Trump, who has praised Carr's stance.</p>

          <p>MicroStrategy's executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has predicted that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass the S&P 500 as the world's primary standard for long-term wealth preservation. He argues that Bitcoin's lack of cash flows makes it "perfect money," similar to historical assets like gold and land. Saylor believes the asset is maturing as it transfers from early adopters to long-term institutional buyers, reducing volatility. He envisions Bitcoin serving as "digital capital" to collateralize a new generation of credit instruments that will outperform traditional corporate and sovereign debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Key details confirm that automatic gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties, will not qualify for the deduction because they are not voluntary. Furthermore, workers in certain "specified service" sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services will be ineligible for the tax break.

          <p>This article reflects on the cinematic career of Robert Redford, arguing that a central theme across his work was the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. From his iconic roles in films like "The Candidate" and "Downhill Racer" to his directorial efforts such as "Quiz Show," Redford consistently explored the perils of a society obsessed with winning. As an actor, he often portrayed characters whose athletic grace and easy success masked deeper flaws or led to Pyrrhic victories. This recurring motif was rooted in his own experiences and his belief that true value lies not in winning, but in the integrity of the effort.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will raise the retail prices of its Xbox Series S and Series X consoles in the United States, effective in October. The company attributed the price hikes, which range from $20 to $70 depending on the model, to "changes in the macroeconomic environment." While not explicitly stated, the move is widely seen as a response to the Trump administration's tariffs, which have also prompted price increases from competitors Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft confirmed that prices for accessories like controllers will not change, and the increases will not apply to markets outside of the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers are facing higher grocery bills due to a combination of three primary factors: tariffs, climate change, and agricultural labor shortages. Food industry analyst Phil Lempert explains that the Trump administration's tariffs have increased the cost of imported goods like coffee, with companies passing these expenses on to shoppers. Climate change is shifting growing regions for produce, while new immigration policies have contributed to a shortage of farm workers. These pressures are leading to higher prices and "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced while prices remain the same, forcing consumers to change their shopping habits.</p>
