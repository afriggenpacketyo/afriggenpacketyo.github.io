          <h2>LAFC Seeks Redemption Against Rival LA Galaxy Following Disappointing Club World Cup Exit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>LAFC aims to win back fan support in its upcoming derby against rival LA Galaxy after a disappointing performance in the Club World Cup. Despite recent wins in the MLS, the team views this rivalry match as a crucial opportunity for redemption, with coach Steve Cherundolo emphasizing that statistics are irrelevant in such high-stakes games. The team will be missing key players due to injury, including Aaron Long who is out for the season. Meanwhile, LA Galaxy supporters plan to protest the match by not attending, adding another layer of complexity to the highly anticipated Southern California classic.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for running a sophisticated, family-operated drug trafficking ring in southeast England. Mason recruited her children and other relatives to distribute cocaine worth up to £80 million, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The Metropolitan Police conducted a seven-month surveillance operation, tracking the gang as they completed drug and cash handovers across the country. The judge described Mason as having a 'leading role' and corrupting her own children, who also received lengthy prison sentences.</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced the deployment of a new force to southern Syria to quell deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities near Suweida. The clashes, which have reportedly killed over 700 people, prompted accusations that government troops had previously committed extrajudicial killings against Druze civilians. Following these events and Israeli military strikes in the area, the US ambassador to Turkey announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria. The new Syrian force is intended to protect civilians and restore order amid the escalating conflict and widespread human rights violations.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch, boxing experts are divided on the outcome of the fight between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium. Dubois seeks to avenge his 2023 loss and become the first undisputed British heavyweight champion in over two decades. While some analysts believe Usyk's superior technical skill and experience will lead him to another victory, others argue that Dubois's recent form, confidence, and power could result in an upset. The key questions revolve around whether the 38-year-old Usyk has been diminished by recent tough fights or if Dubois has truly evolved into an elite fighter.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese medical researchers has developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The innovative approach allows for the production of anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body, significantly reducing the complexity and cost associated with conventional methods. The team successfully used this technique to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This development could make the cutting-edge immunotherapy, which currently costs over one million yuan per treatment, more accessible to a wider range of patients globally.</p>

The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and unable to absorb water effectively, exacerbating the flood risk.

He demonstrated increased velocity and better command, providing a template for the dependability the team needs from him for its championship aspirations.

The findings provide a potential explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. Importantly, the research team also identified specific drugs that, when used with chemotherapy, could inhibit this detrimental effect in mice.

The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which they claim would increase bore pressure enough to fire heavier, more destructive projectiles at high speeds.

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it will facilitate the return of former detainees from a controversial El Salvadoran prison, known as CECOT, back to the U.S. if required by a court. This development was revealed in a status report concerning over 250 Venezuelan migrants who were released from CECOT and sent to Venezuela as part of a prisoner exchange. An ICE official stated that the U.S. obtained assurances from the Maduro regime that it would not obstruct the travel of any former detainee whose appearance is legally required in the United States. The situation highlights the complex legal and diplomatic maneuvering involved in the prisoner swap.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Strong Public Support for U.S. Return to the Moon and Mars Exploration</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that a significant majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The poll also found that the public continues to view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These findings suggest broad, cross-partisan public backing for ambitious space exploration goals as NASA prepares for its upcoming Artemis missions.</p>

          <p>The CEO of U.S. tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave following a viral video from a Coldplay concert that sparked widespread online speculation.

          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from 'critical weakness' due to severe understaffing, hindering its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit found an overall vacancy rate of 32%, leading to the agency closing complaints without proper on-site inspections and failing to adequately document cases. Workplace safety experts argue that this chronic understaffing has crippled the agency, making workers vulnerable. While Cal/OSHA states it has made strides in hiring, the audit highlights a systemic failure to enforce safety standards effectively.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, his company News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal.

Trump vehemently denies writing the letter, which the article claimed included a hand-drawn sketch of a naked woman. The suit names the reporters and executives involved, escalating a conflict between the president and the prominent media outlet over its reporting on his connection to the disgraced financier.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being sucked into an MRI machine at a medical facility on Long Island, New York. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress for his relative. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain, causing the man to be drawn in and suffer severe, ultimately fatal injuries. The incident underscores the extreme dangers of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines, which require strict safety protocols to prevent such catastrophic accidents. Experts note that injuries of this nature are rare.</p>
