          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's updated tariff schedule, with many expressing relief over rates that were lower than initially feared. Cambodia's prime minister celebrated the news, while Thailand's finance minister noted it helps maintain global competitiveness. Taiwan's president indicated that negotiations are ongoing for further reductions from its new 20% temporary tariff. Malaysia and Japan also saw their rates lowered, with leaders in both nations highlighting the reduced economic uncertainty and committing to measures to mitigate the tariffs' impact on local businesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, set to take effect next week. The executive order details duties ranging from 10% to over 40%, impacting nearly 70 countries, with a baseline 10% tariff on unlisted nations. A senior official explained the rates are tiered based on whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with a given country. The move has drawn concern from economists about potential economic uncertainty, though the administration maintains the strategy will generate revenue and rebalance global trade.

          <p>Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade following a breakdown in contract extension negotiations. After sitting out the initial days of training camp, McLaurin reported to the team but has been a 'hold-in' on the physically unable to perform list. The two-time Pro Bowl selection is entering the final year of his contract and is coming off a career-best season with 1,096 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns. The team's general manager expressed a desire to keep McLaurin, acknowledging that such negotiations can take time.</p>

According to Kuwait's deputy minister of defense, the project marks a milestone in cooperation, and military training programs between the two nations will continue to expand. The factory will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition. This development signifies a deepening of ties that began in 1995 when Kuwait became the first Gulf state to sign a military cooperation agreement with China, reflecting Beijing's increased engagement in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent trade actions have brought tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, to the forefront of economic policy. The stated goal of these measures is to bolster American manufacturing, protect domestic jobs, and reduce the U.S. trade deficit by making foreign products more expensive. However, this approach has created volatility in the global economy and led some companies to increase prices for U.S. consumers. Critics argue the policy is a negotiating tactic, while supporters point to increased federal revenue and new trade deals as signs of success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen almost $200 million in federal science and medical research grants for UCLA, citing the university's alleged failure to maintain a research environment free of antisemitism and its use of discrimination in admissions. The decision, communicated by the National Science Foundation, follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with 'deliberate indifference' to the civil rights of Jewish students. UCLA's chancellor called the action deeply disappointing, stating that defunding life-saving research does not address the underlying allegations and is a loss for the nation.</p>

The project will be funded by the president and other 'patriot donors,' not taxpayer money, and is intended to provide a permanent, all-weather venue for large-scale events that currently require tents on the South Lawn. The new building will replace the current East Wing and represents the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony in 1948, slated for completion before 2029.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering for design software company Figma resulted in a 250% surge in its stock price on the first day of trading, creating a massive windfall for its early investors. Four prominent venture capital firms—Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia—are now collectively holding approximately $24 billion worth of Figma stock. The company's successful debut, which raised $1.2 billion, has been a celebratory moment for Silicon Valley, signaling a potential opening of the tech IPO market after several sluggish years.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is advancing legislation to add $18 billion to the state's fund for wildfire victims, which officials warn could be depleted by next year. The proposal would source half the money from customers of the state's three largest utilities by extending an existing monthly surcharge, with the other half coming from the utilities' shareholders. The plan aims to stabilize the fund as climate change makes wildfires more destructive, but it has already drawn criticism from both consumer advocacy groups and utility executives over the proposed financial contributions.</p>

          <p>Testimony at a state hearing has revealed that top officials in Kerr County, Texas, were either asleep or out of town when catastrophic flash floods struck over the July 4th weekend, killing at least 95 people. The county's emergency management coordinator and the sheriff both testified they were asleep, while the county's top executive was away at a lake house. The officials stated they had no warning about the magnitude of the storm, which caused one of the deadliest flood events in the state's history, raising questions about the adequacy of official warnings and preparedness.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of the second Trump term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. This represents a 120% increase in arrests compared to the same period in 2024. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation with ICE and large immigrant populations, aligning with the administration's mandate to oversee a mass deportation effort.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Discover Potato Evolved from Ancient Tomato Hybrid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved the long-standing mystery of the potato's origin, revealing it evolved from a hybridization of an ancient tomato ancestor and a non-tuber-producing wild species. Researchers discovered that a crucial gene from the ancient tomato, combined with a gene from the other parent species, enabled the modern potato to form its characteristic starch-rich tubers. The findings demonstrate how interbreeding between species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits, leading to the emergence of new and distinct species like the common potato.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by using a 'dark fleet' of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The illicit trade involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters, primarily off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers often turning off their transponders or covering their identification numbers to avoid detection. This trade is a significant source of revenue for Iran, reportedly generating tens of billions of dollars that help prop up its regime. The activity continues to ramp up despite multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions targeting the practice.</p>

          <p>The family of a 79-year-old woman killed in a car crash in Cornwall is calling for an overhaul of the driving regulations for older adults in the UK. The woman's daughter believes her mother would still be alive if the rules were different, arguing that the current system of self-declaring medical conditions to the DVLA is inadequate. As the UK population ages, road safety experts and victims' families are advocating for measures like mandatory medical referrals and vision checks to ensure elderly drivers are still fit to be on the road.</p>
