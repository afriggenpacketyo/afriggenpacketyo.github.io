          <p>A deadly attack occurred at a bus stop in north Jerusalem where two Palestinian gunmen opened fire, resulting in the deaths of five people and injuring several others. According to Israeli police and emergency services, both assailants were killed at the scene by a security officer and a civilian. The militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, describing it as a natural response to the ongoing conflict and Israeli actions. This incident represents one of the most fatal attacks in the city since the beginning of the war in Gaza, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Tom Phillips, a New Zealand father who had been a fugitive with his three children for nearly four years, was shot and killed by police during a confrontation. The incident occurred after officers responded to a robbery and pursued Phillips, leading to a shootout that also left one officer seriously injured. The case had captivated the nation, as Phillips, an experienced bushman, had successfully evaded a nationwide search for years. All three of his children were found unharmed at a remote campsite and have been reunited with their mother, bringing a tragic end to the long-running ordeal.</p>

          <p>Following Russia's most intense aerial bombardment on Ukraine since the war's start, the Trump administration has threatened to impose tougher sanctions. The attacks, which killed four people and damaged a key government building in Kyiv, have prompted international calls for stronger action against Moscow. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that Washington is prepared to escalate economic pressure but requires stronger European support to cause a collapse of the Russian economy. President Trump indicated European leaders would visit Washington to discuss the war, signaling a potential escalation in the coordinated Western response.</p>

          <p>The board of the Tottenham Hotspur football club has announced that it is not for sale, having unequivocally rejected two preliminary expressions of interest. This declaration follows recent speculation about a potential takeover after the departure of executive chairman Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman. The club's majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, confirmed it has no intention of selling its stake. The firm statement aims to quell rumors and stabilize the club's direction amid leadership changes.</p>

          <p>Several key elections in the fall of 2025 are poised to serve as important indicators of the American political climate under the second Trump administration. Races to watch include the New York City mayoral contest, gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, and a vote on redrawn congressional maps in California. These contests are drawing national attention and significant campaign spending. Their outcomes could signal shifts in voter sentiment and influence the balance of power in Congress heading into the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery factory under construction in Georgia, where over 300 South Korean workers were detained, has created diplomatic friction between the U.S. and South Korea. South Korea's foreign minister is traveling to the U.S. to address the situation, which occurred shortly after the two nations pledged closer business ties. The incident has raised concerns in Seoul about the treatment of a key ally, especially given South Korea's massive investment commitments in the American economy. The raid also poses potential setbacks for Georgia's largest economic development project.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that autonomous trucking is a necessary technological advancement for the United States, not a threat to jobs. The author contends that self-driving trucks are essential to address the nation's severe driver shortage, reduce rising logistics costs, and enhance road safety, as human error causes most accidents. Citing fierce global competition, particularly from China, the piece advocates for clear and consistent regulations to foster innovation. The successful implementation of autonomous freight in states like Texas is presented as a model for national policy to ensure American leadership in next-generation transportation.</p>

          <p>WNBA rookie Caitlin Clark has announced that a groin injury will end her season, a decision the Indiana Fever organization appears to support to protect her long-term health. The article argues that this sensible medical decision has been met with outrage from a toxic segment of followers who use her as a symbol in culture wars. These individuals, the article suggests, are not concerned with her well-being but are frustrated by the loss of their ability to frame her on-court experiences as evidence of persecution. Clark has repeatedly asked not to be used in these narratives, but her requests have been largely ignored.</p>

          <p>States across the U.S. are making painful cuts to health programs after the Trump administration reduced federal funding, with more significant financial hits expected from the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." This law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by as much as $1 trillion over a decade, shifting substantial costs to states already facing strained budgets. In response, states like Texas have canceled free health clinics, while others are halting projects or creating trust funds to soften the blow.

          <p>Upcoming U.S. dietary guidelines may reverse decades of advice that favored low-fat dairy, reflecting an evolution in nutritional science. For years, health authorities recommended limiting full-fat products like whole milk and cheese due to their saturated fat content. However, recent research suggests that saturated fat from dairy does not impact heart disease risk as previously thought, and some studies even indicate potential benefits of full-fat options. Nutrition experts argue there is a lack of strong evidence proving low-fat dairy is superior, prompting a potential shift toward a more neutral stance on dairy fat content.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's public school teacher workforce has undergone a profound transformation. In the storm's aftermath, thousands of veteran, predominantly Black teachers were fired and often replaced by young, inexperienced educators from programs like Teach For America. This shift led to improved test scores but came at a significant social cost. Over time, however, the system has evolved, with charter schools increasingly hiring experienced, certified teachers with local roots, leading to a workforce that now more closely resembles its pre-Katrina demographics while maintaining educational gains.</p>

Companies like Walmart's Sam's Club are finding that natural ingredients like turmeric and beets can be costly, less stable, and sometimes alter flavor.

This policy has created a complex trade dynamic, with Washington penalizing India for a practice from which the U.S. market also benefits.

          <p>The global order established after World War II, built on institutions like the United Nations and principles of collective security, is facing significant challenges. This framework, largely shaped by the Allied victors, is credited with preventing another world war and fostering decades of trade globalization. However, in recent years, this system has come under strain. Both Western nations and China accuse each other of undermining its principles, leading to increased geopolitical friction and a potential reshaping of international governance and power dynamics.</p>

          <p>A former British Army sergeant major, Michael Webber, has admitted to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who took her own life in 2021. Beck had filed a complaint after Webber pinned her down and tried to kiss her, but an inquest found the Army's handling of her report contributed to her death. Her family stated that the chain of command failed her by not reporting the assault to the police. Webber's guilty plea avoids a traumatic trial for the family, but they emphasized that nothing can undo the loss of their daughter.</p>

          <p>A global talent war is intensifying between private equity giants and Wall Street investment banks, particularly for fundraising and investor relations roles. As securing capital becomes more challenging, private equity firms are aggressively recruiting, often poaching from banks' analyst pools. This has led to investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan implementing stricter rules to retain their junior talent. The competition highlights a bifurcation in the industry, where large, multi-strategy firms can afford to expand their teams while smaller firms struggle to hire and retain staff.</p>
