        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize is juxtaposed with sharp criticism from Nobel laureate economists regarding his economic policies. Joseph Stiglitz described the U.S. as a 'scary place to invest' due to tariff policies risking stagflation, a concern shared by the Federal Reserve. Other laureates, Roger Myerson and Simon Johnson, voiced worries about American politics and isolationism, respectively. Despite these critiques, former First Lady Hillary Clinton offered conditional support for Trump's Nobel bid if he could end the Ukraine-Russia war without territorial concessions. This article highlights the complex interplay between political aspirations and economic realities.</p>

          <p>Several prominent brands, including American Eagle, Swatch, and Cracker Barrel, have recently faced significant consumer backlash over controversial advertising and rebranding efforts. Critics have lambasted campaigns for being tone-deaf, culturally insensitive, or simply 'sterile' and 'woke.' Experts suggest these are 'empathy failures,' as companies use outdated strategies to navigate complex cultural landscapes. While some brands like Gap successfully counter negative perceptions, the incidents highlight the increasing scrutiny consumers apply, forcing companies to balance attention-grabbing tactics with genuine connection and representation. This article explores the challenges brands face in an era of heightened social awareness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to reform its asylum appeals system by establishing a new independent body with adjudicators to expedite case hearings. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated this initiative aims to tackle 'unacceptable delays' and reduce the reliance on taxpayer-funded hotels, which currently house 32,000 asylum seekers. The move follows public protests and a High Court ruling blocking an asylum hotel in Epping. With 51,000 cases awaiting appeal decisions, the government is under pressure to streamline the process, though opposition parties criticize the current system as chaotic. This article details the government's efforts to address a pressing social and financial issue.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Pew Research Center indicates a significant decline in the U.S. immigrant population and immigrant workers since Donald Trump took office for his second term in January. The immigrant population decreased by over a million people, from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. This reduction, also reflected in a drop of 750,000 immigrant workers from the labor force, is attributed to the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown. This article highlights a notable demographic shift and the impact of federal policies on the country's foreign-born residents. The study provides crucial insights into current trends.</p>
