          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations, sparking a clash between federal and state authorities. President Trump cited the need to address "riots & looters," while California Governor Newsom accused the federal government of "sowing chaos" and inflaming tensions, asserting local authorities can handle the situation. The deployment, authorized under Title 10, bypasses the usual consultation with the governor, raising legal questions about federal overreach. The Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement, is waived under Title 10 authority. The situation has drawn criticism from L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who expressed anger at the tactics used and pledged support for the immigrant community. Optimism surrounding this event is low due to the escalating tensions and the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, shares her experience of returning to work part-time after having a baby, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents. Cole believes that offering such flexibility is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also emphasized the need for more schools to offer flexible hours, especially as data suggests a decline in the number of new teachers entering the field. Sam Alner, a computer science teacher and vice principal, notes that the demanding nature of teaching can lead to burnout, causing experienced staff to seek better work-life balance or higher salaries. The ability to provide flexible work arrangements is seen as a key factor in supporting teachers and improving the overall educational environment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece raises concerns about President Trump's self-enrichment, noting a substantial increase in his personal wealth since starting his 2024 campaign.

The author warns that the U.S. political system risks becoming corrupted, with the nation's interests becoming indistinguishable from its leader's.

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight to blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how nanowire implants made from tellurium were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, converting visible and infrared light into electrical energy. This advancement holds significant promise for treating human blindness, offering a potential solution for replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often marketed as a tool for weight loss and improving metabolic health, it can be problematic for individuals with a history of eating disorders. Experts caution that any form of caloric restriction or rigid food rules significantly increases the risk of developing eating disorders, which have significant psychiatric and medical consequences. Instead, they recommend intuitive eating that listens to hunger and fullness cues, emphasizing balanced meals, variety, and satisfaction.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the disappearance of Jermain Charlo, a Montana mom who went missing in June 2018, remains ongoing, with no resolution after six years. Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, and her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, has provided conflicting accounts of her whereabouts. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone pinged off a tower near DeFrance's property after her disappearance, and he later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho. Despite extensive searches and investigations, Charlo has not been found, and her family continues to seek justice and answers.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original set of emoji after 26 years, marking the end of an era for the visual language of digital communications. The Docomo emoji, introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, helped popularize emoji in Japan and globally. New Android smartphones and feature phones will adopt Google's Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead, as Docomo's emoji have "fulfilled their role." The original set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. They argue that overwork is not sustainable and that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources rather than longer hours. Founders insist that startups need access to the right resources—funding, talent, and support—to grow, innovate quickly, and scale effectively. Instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to position themselves as key players in the global startup scene.</p>

De Kai, a machine learning pioneer, argues that AI is changing the social climate and requires a paradigm shift to ensure responsible development. Since AI learns by absorbing online content, De Kai emphasizes the need to be conscientious about the information and values AI systems are exposed to. His new book, Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future, explores this concept and encourages people to become better role models for AI.</p>
