This growth occurs within a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, with Circle planning to launch a new proprietary blockchain called Arc.

Sphere Entertainment CEO James Dolan highlighted the project's groundbreaking nature, which uses AI to expand the film's original frames and incorporates 4D elements like haptic seats and custom scents. The company hopes the popular attraction will boost the overall visitor rate to the venue, which currently sits around 7% of Las Vegas tourists.

          <p>Newly released documents from the Uvalde school district reveal that its former police chief, Pete Arredondo, had received active shooter training just two months before the Robb Elementary massacre. This training explicitly stated that an officer's first priority is to "move in and confront the attacker," a directive he failed to follow during the 77-minute delay. The records were released after a prolonged battle for transparency by victims' families and the media. Arredondo is currently facing criminal charges for child endangerment, to which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>The White House has criticized a federal judge's decision not to unseal grand jury materials related to Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's associate, calling the ruling "unfortunate." The judge denied the Justice Department's motion, reasoning that the documents contained no significant, undisclosed information about the crimes. He noted that the grand juries were not used for investigative purposes and heard testimony only from law enforcement, not from any victims or firsthand witnesses. The evidence presented is now almost entirely a matter of public record, according to the judge's opinion.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan lawmakers are considering a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported parts, many from China. The proposal aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by allowing companies to brand these products as "Made in Paraguay." Officials see this as a strategic opportunity to become an attractive assembly hub, capitalizing on recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and similar levies on Brazilian exports. The policy would mirror Paraguay's successful automotive strategy, which has led to 90% of motorcycles being assembled domestically.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to finalize the legal and mechanical details of a deal imposing a 15% export tax on specific Nvidia and AMD AI chips sold to China. This arrangement allows the companies to receive export licenses for their China-specific chips in exchange for a portion of the revenue paid to the U.S. government. A White House spokesperson confirmed the Department of Commerce is ironing out the implementation and suggested the policy could potentially expand to other companies in the future.

          <p>Reverse mortgages are a financial product allowing homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly loan payments, but they come with significant considerations. While most are federally insured, providing protections like ensuring the loan balance never exceeds the home's value, risks remain. Homeowners are still responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to pay can lead to foreclosure. The loan is best suited for those planning to age in place, as the accumulating interest and fees can significantly erode equity, impacting inheritances or funds for future housing.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has issued a recall for more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from the 2023 to 2025 model years due to a potentially dangerous defect. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a rear axle hub bolt may fatigue and break. This failure could damage the axle hub splines, leading to a loss of driving power or causing the vehicle to roll away when the parking brake is not engaged. Ford has stated that it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue.</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested that the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report, a key economic indicator. In an interview, Antoni, a longtime critic of the agency, called the report flawed and proposed replacing it with less timely quarterly data. This has sparked alarm among economists, who fear it signals an attempt to politicize and dismantle the agency responsible for crucial, impartial data on the U.S. economy. The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has released its annual human rights reports with drastic reductions in content, cutting their length by approximately one-third and omitting entire categories of abuses. An internal memo instructed editors to remove sections on issues like gender-based violence, government corruption, and violations of free assembly, unless explicitly required by law. Critics and human rights advocates argue that this "streamlining" severely weakens a crucial tool for global accountability and effectively gives authoritarian regimes a pass on many of their violations.</p>

The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, has already caused deadly flooding there, with at least eight fatalities reported. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., early forecast models show it could become a major hurricane by the time it nears the Caribbean islands. Its long-term path remains uncertain, but it marks an increase in activity for the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

A national drought group has warned that the country is suffering from "nationally significant" water deficits, which are impacting agriculture, damaging wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The prolonged period of hot, dry weather has led to millions of people being placed under hosepipe bans and is causing disruptions to rail services in the south of England due to shrinking soil under the tracks.</p>

The piece suggests that while the administration celebrates rising revenues, the underlying economic consequences, such as higher prices and potential job losses, are being ignored.
