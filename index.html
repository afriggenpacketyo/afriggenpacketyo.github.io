          <p>Jacqueline Ma, a former California 'teacher of the year,' has been sentenced to 30 years to life for grooming and sexually assaulting two elementary school boys in her classroom. Ma exploited her position at Lincoln Acres Elementary, using gifts and special attention to manipulate her victims. She even created an unauthorized after-school program for one boy, directing him to message her through a school chat application. The case came to light after a parent discovered inappropriate messages, leading to an investigation that uncovered a second victim. (sexual assault)</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending a plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, calling it 'a gift.' However, Qatari spokespeople are pushing back on the use of the term 'gift,' instead calling it a temporary transfer of an aircraft. This raises legal and ethical questions, particularly concerning the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. While the White House insists any gift would comply with applicable laws, critics call for investigation into what could be the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, releasing a model ordinance and announcing new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom emphasized the need for cities and counties to take action, stating that the state is providing ample resources to address the crisis. The model ordinance stresses prioritizing shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments, with Newsom asserting that allowing people to die on the streets is not compassionate. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his term amid speculation about his political future.</p>

          <p>An auction of the Riggio family's art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with presold objects and quiet bidding. Experts cited economic uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs as a factor impacting the global art market. While the collection totaled $272 million including fees, it fell short of pre-sale expectations, indicating a shift from the enthusiastic buyer activity seen in 2022. Despite some successful sales, including a Monet painting, the auction highlighted a need for auction houses to work harder in a healthy, but more challenging, market environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, potentially impacting over 8,000 individuals. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's improved security and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return. This decision reverses a 2023 extension by the Biden administration, which cited a humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover. Advocates criticize the move as unconscionable, while the Trump administration maintains it aligns with the original temporary intent of TPS. The administration is also seeking to roll back TPS for Venezuela, a move currently halted by a judge.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing significant restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), aiming to limit funding and benefits to offset the costs of President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding and impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries, potentially impacting millions of low-income families. Republicans argue this approach improves program efficiency and accountability, while critics contend it would deepen hunger and poverty. The proposed changes include expanding work requirements to older adults and limiting aid to U.S. citizens and green card holders.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility has led to significant flight delays at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The FAA cited at least three controllers being scheduled every hour, but sources claim the number of fully certified controllers was lower. This incident follows previous radar outages and equipment failures, causing stress among controllers and shaking traveler confidence.

Professor Ralph Keeling, continuing his father's work on monitoring CO2 levels, warns that these cuts would degrade the nation's ability to project future climate change impacts. The NOAA's carbon sampling program, which collects air from around the world, is essential for maintaining the Keeling Curve, a key indicator of rising carbon dioxide levels.

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate since 2014, driven by oil and gas sector recovery and growth in tech and finance. The World Bank expects growth to slightly increase to 3.7% in 2025. However, the agriculture sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's government implemented reforms including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but these have led to a cost-of-living crisis. Despite some relief in food prices, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty in 2024.</p>

He credits his openness and transparency for building trust and accelerating progress on issues like the search for missing Americans and trade agreements.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Investors view gold as a safe haven asset, but its price is not immune to fluctuations. While some experts predict continued growth, others warn of a potential market bubble. Central banks are increasingly buying gold, seeking independence from dollar-based systems. However, analysts advise investors to diversify their portfolios and caution against speculative short-term investments in gold. (not investment advice)</p>

While these drugs are effective for weight loss, their high cost and side effects raise questions about who should take them. The primary goal should be improving health by reducing visceral fat, which is linked to various chronic diseases. BMI is a poor measure, but waist size and blood-lipid patterns can indicate organ dysfunction. GLP-1 drugs are most beneficial for those with excess visceral fat who are suffering its consequences.</p>
