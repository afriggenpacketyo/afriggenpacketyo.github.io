          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced Emil Bove's nomination for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote proceeded along party lines after all Democratic members walked out in protest, citing Chairman Chuck Grassley's refusal to allow further debate or hear from a whistleblower who has accused Bove of unethical conduct. Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, faces significant opposition over his past actions at the Justice Department, including allegations of suggesting the administration ignore court orders. His confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain, as he can only afford to lose three Republican votes.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced it is speeding up its production timeline for its new U.S. facilities by several quarters due to strong demand from American customers. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer, which has committed $165 billion to U.S. manufacturing, reported record-high profits that surpassed estimates. CEO C.C. Wei acknowledged potential risks from U.S. tariff policies on consumer-related electronics but stated that customer behavior has not yet changed.

          <p>A discussion on a Reddit forum has ignited a debate about the etiquette of eating fragrant foods in the confined space of an airplane cabin. One user questioned whether it was inconsiderate to bring aromatic meals into economy class, prompting a wide range of responses from fellow travelers. While some strongly agreed that bringing smelly food is rude and compared it to microwaving fish in an office, others defended the practice, citing the need to eat during tight travel schedules or due to dietary restrictions. Travel experts generally advise passengers to be mindful of others and avoid bringing particularly pungent foods on board.</p>

          <p>Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Governor reportedly on Donald Trump's shortlist for Fed Chair, has called for significant changes in the central bank's policy conduct. In a recent interview, Warsh criticized the current leadership's hesitancy to cut interest rates and advocated for what he termed "regime change." He also proposed a new accord between the Treasury and the Fed to coordinate on managing the national debt, arguing the two are currently working at cross-purposes. These views align with Trump's public pressure on the Fed to lower rates and change its leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation that would amend the Stafford Act to include extreme heat as a "major disaster," making affected communities eligible for federal FEMA assistance. The move follows a record-breaking heat dome in June and highlights that heat waves, despite being deadly, are not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster type. Proponents argue this would unlock crucial funding for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. However, the bill faces opposition, with some, including a former FEMA administrator, arguing that heat-related issues can already be addressed through existing hazard mitigation grants.</p>

An amendment to protect funding for the PEPFAR HIV/Aids program was successful, securing enough votes for the bill's passage.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that first-generation migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers. Researchers found this wage gap is not primarily due to unequal pay for the same job, but rather because migrants often face structural barriers that limit their access to higher-paying industries and roles. The study, which compared Germany to eight other Western nations, also noted that the wage gap persists into the second generation at 7.7%, which is higher than the international average. The report recommends better language support and recognition of foreign qualifications to improve integration.</p>

          <p>A recent surge in deadly flash floods across the United States is being driven by a combination of factors, including climate change, aging infrastructure, and population growth. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall events that overwhelm drainage systems not designed for such volumes. This summer has seen a record number of flood warnings issued, with catastrophic events in states like Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey. Experts note that increased development reduces the ground's ability to absorb water, exacerbating runoff and making densely populated areas especially vulnerable to these rapid and destructive floods.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections across the United Kingdom, a change that could be in place before the next general election. The move would enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers, representing the most significant expansion of the electorate since 1969. The proposal also includes other electoral reforms, such as allowing bank cards as voter ID and moving toward an automated voter registration system. The policy, a Labour party manifesto commitment, has been welcomed by student groups but criticized by Conservatives as "hopelessly confused."</p>

France stands out as an exception with a more diverse team, which players attribute to a dense, accessible network of clubs.

The deportations exacerbate the long-standing poor treatment of Afghans in Iran, who face systemic discrimination despite deep cultural ties.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's DOJ Deprioritizes White-Collar Crime While Targeting Political Foes</h2>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Donald Trump's Department of Justice is shifting its focus away from traditional white-collar crimes while pursuing investigations against his political opponents. The administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and federal prosecutions of corporate crime have declined over 10% compared to last year. Meanwhile, the DOJ has opened investigations into figures like California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue this pattern indicates a politicized approach to justice that turns a blind eye to corporate malfeasance while weaponizing the department against rivals.</p>

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, the company's strategy of funneling its intellectual property from films and television into its theme parks remains a cornerstone of its success. From the original "Peter Pan's Flight" to modern lands like "Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge," this integration has made the Experiences division a major profit driver, out-earning the entertainment division that creates the content. The company plans to invest $60 billion in its parks over the next decade, with a heavy focus on IP-driven attractions like new "Avatar" and "Monsters Inc." areas, ensuring the cycle of content-to-experience continues to fuel the Disney flywheel.</p>
