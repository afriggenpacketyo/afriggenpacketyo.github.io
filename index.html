          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a sharp decline in its stock value, falling over 8%, after reporting a 59% drop in net profit for the first quarter of its fiscal year. The company attributed the S$186 million profit to lower interest income and losses from associated companies, particularly its 25.1% stake in Air India. Despite the profit plunge, the carrier noted that both passenger and cargo demand remain strong, suggesting underlying operational health amidst financial headwinds. This news highlights the complex financial pressures on airlines even as travel rebounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a popular nightclub in the Turks and Caicos Islands resulted in the deaths of three people and left ten others injured. Officials have described the early morning attack at the Hookah and Cigar Lounge as unprecedented for the British territory and linked it to gang-related violence. Premier Charles Washington Misick noted that much of the violence appears concentrated in Haitian communities and urged cooperation with law enforcement. Authorities are searching for at least four suspects and have offered a reward for information leading to their arrest.</p>

In addition, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make $600 billion in investments.

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request to play an additional season of college football. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that would allow him to play for the Trojans this year, challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule" on eligibility. Wingfield argues that the denial is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles between student-athletes and the NCAA over eligibility rules and potential lost earnings opportunities.</p>

The change aims to give more people a fair chance to secure a spot at these highly sought-after locations.

He suggests that investors are currently experiencing "tariff ennui" and are more focused on other pressing economic factors. This week's agenda is dominated by Big Tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, and the release of new employment data. Cramer argues that until these key events pass, Wall Street will likely remain preoccupied and unresponsive to trade policy news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court in Bogotá has found former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe guilty of witness tampering and fraud, making him the first ex-president in the country's history to be convicted of a crime. The 73-year-old was convicted of attempting to bribe jailed ex-paramilitaries to prevent them from testifying about his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The case, which dates back to 2012, is highly politicized and represents a landmark moment for Colombia's justice system. Uribe, who has consistently maintained his innocence, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that President Donald Trump's perspective on global events, such as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, is heavily influenced by what he sees on television. When asked about starvation in Gaza, Trump cited television images of hungry children as his primary evidence, stating, "you can’t fake that." This reliance on media, particularly cable news, over official intelligence briefings, makes him susceptible to manipulation but also attunes him to public sentiment. This approach to policymaking raises concerns about the influence of misinformation and the president's narrow information stream.</p>
