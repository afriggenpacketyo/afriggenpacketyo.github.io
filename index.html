          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which will remove deportation protections and work permits for over 8,000 Afghans. Officials stated that Afghanistan's improved security situation and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return, despite a humanitarian crisis since the Taliban's 2021 takeover. This decision has faced criticism from advocacy groups who argue it is unconscionable. The Trump administration has also sought to roll back TPS for Venezuela, but this move was halted by a judge.</p>

The US agreed to lower its combined tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30 per cent for 90 days after talks in Geneva on Monday, cooling a stand-off between the worldâ€™s two biggest economies since US President Donald Trump rolled out his so-called reciprocal tariffs on the nationâ€™s trading partners.

          <p>Researchers in China are cautioning against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's AI in hospitals, citing potential clinical safety and privacy risks. At least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek's large language models (LLMs) for clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warn that DeepSeek's tendency to generate factually incorrect outputs could lead to substantial clinical risk, and that healthcare professionals could become overreliant on or uncritical of DeepSeekâ€™s output.</p>
