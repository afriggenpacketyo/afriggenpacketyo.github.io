        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained injuries during an Israeli attack last month. The sources confirmed Iranian state media reports that Pezeshkian was hurt in his leg while escaping through an emergency shaft during a Supreme National Security Council meeting. It is currently unclear whether he was the intentional target of the strike. The 12-day conflict between the two nations resulted in a ceasefire brokered by the Trump administration after hundreds of casualties in Iran and 28 in Israel.</p>

          <p>Following public pressure, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bondi confirmed the Justice Department would file a motion with the court to release the documents. This move comes amid growing demands for transparency from both the public and politicians, though legal experts note that releasing grand jury testimony is rare and requires judicial approval. The transcripts would only represent a fraction of the evidence gathered by investigators in the case.</p>

          <h2>China Reveals New Military Drone with Vertical Takeoff and Landing Capabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can take off and land vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone recently completed a reconnaissance test in a mountainous region, demonstrating its advanced autonomous capabilities. The design, which resembles the U.S. military's V-BAT drone, allows for high-speed flight combined with the flexibility of not needing a runway. This makes it highly adaptable for deployment in remote or rugged terrains for military operations.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is moving forward with a vote on a Trump administration request to rescind approximately $9 billion in funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The process was delayed by debates over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a measure Democrats sought to attach to the bill. The Senate has already passed a slightly smaller version of the cuts, which targets programs like USAID and funding for public stations such as NPR and PBS. The bill faces a tight deadline before the funds must be allocated as originally planned.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for canceling $4 billion in federal funding for its high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, argues the decision was politically motivated, arbitrary, and will cause significant economic harm to the state's Central Valley. Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as a "heartless attack" intended to punish California. The administration cited major budget overruns and delays as the reason for pulling the funds, stating the project had "no viable path" forward.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed, primarily over the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. Trump has also criticized Powell over the cost of a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. While the president has floated the idea of firing Powell, this would be a legally untested move, as Fed chairs are typically protected from political influence to ensure the bank's independence. This conflict highlights the tension between a president's desire for economic stimulus and the Fed's mandate to maintain price stability.</p>

This article analyzes the announcement as a political maneuver designed to appeal to his base and health-conscious figures like Robert F.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high. The easing was partly attributed to a slight decline in the rapid pace of rice price increases, though inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. This data comes amid concerns over economic growth due to U.S. tariffs and the rising cost of living. While persistent inflation could support an interest rate hike, some analysts believe the central bank will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common vein condition. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swelling in his legs. A letter from the White House physician described CVI as a benign condition, particularly in older individuals, and stated that there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The physician's note concluded that the president remains in "excellent health" overall.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the U.S. to Eswatini under a third-country removal program are being held in solitary confinement, according to an Eswatini government spokesperson. The men, who are from various countries and were convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were sent to the southern African nation because their home countries would not accept them. The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to third countries with which they have no ties, particularly those with poor human rights records like Eswatini, has drawn international condemnation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the Labour Party's decision to once again suspend MP Diane Abbott, a pioneering figure as the first Black woman elected to the House of Commons. The suspension was triggered by a recent interview where she stated she did not regret comments made in 2023 that appeared to downplay antisemitism, which led to her original suspension. Given Labour leader Keir Starmer's pledge to eradicate antisemitism from the party, her lack of regret left the leadership with little choice but to act consistently. The situation underscores the party's ongoing struggle with this sensitive issue.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will conclude its run in May 2026, and the network will retire the "Late Show" franchise entirely. The decision is described as "purely a financial decision" driven by the challenging advertising landscape for late-night television, not the show's performance. Despite being the top-rated late-night show for nine seasons, changing viewer habits and declining ad revenue have made the program financially unsustainable. Colbert, who learned of the decision just before the announcement, has hosted the show for a decade.</p>

The author describes the immense suffering of young patients injured in airstrikes, often orphaned and malnourished, while highlighting the extraordinary heroism of local doctors and nurses who risk their lives daily. The article argues that what is happening is a massacre, not a war, and calls for an end to the blockade and the bombing of hospitals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with the cost of ground beef and steaks up significantly from a year ago. The price surge is driven by a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. Experts do not expect significant price relief soon, as it would take years to rebuild the national herd. (not investment advice)</p>
