          <p>Amazon is shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The service, which launched in 2019, offered original series and other content through a standalone app. Following the shutdown, Freevee's shows and movies will be integrated into Prime Video, where they will be available to watch for free with ads, even without a Prime membership. This move aims to consolidate Amazon's video offerings and simplify the viewing experience for customers, coming after the company introduced an ad-supported tier to Prime Video earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has established a new trade deal with Vietnam, which will impose a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports, as announced by President Donald Trump. This rate is a reduction from a potential 46% but higher than a temporary 10% rate. The agreement also includes a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam from other countries to prevent circumvention of trade barriers, a practice reportedly used by China. In exchange, the deal reportedly grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a split verdict, prosecutors and defense attorneys are debating the potential prison sentence for Sean Combs, who was convicted on two counts but acquitted of racketeering. Prosecutors are suggesting a sentence of approximately four to five years, while the defense argues for around two years. Meanwhile, a key victim, Cassie Ventura, has urged the judge to keep Combs detained pending sentencing, citing him as a danger to witnesses and the community. Prosecutors support this, pointing to trial evidence of a long pattern of abuse and arguing he is a flight risk.</p>

These consumers are reportedly spending less due to concerns over President Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses. Broader economic fears, such as inflation, are also impacting both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers, contributing to the weaker-than-expected financial results for the beverage giant.

          <p>An opinion article champions President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," framing it as a landmark achievement that will fundamentally strengthen the U.S. economy. The author argues that making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, especially the provision for 100% business expensing, will unleash significant investment, job creation, and wage growth. The piece contrasts this pro-growth agenda with the Democratic opposition, which it characterizes as a vote for higher taxes. The legislation is presented as a critical tool for ensuring American competitiveness and securing a prosperous future for all citizens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artist Bad Bunny's latest project, a short film and album titled 'DebÃ­ Tirar MÃ¡s Fotos,' has elevated the endangered Puerto Rican crested toad, or sapo concho, into a cultural symbol. The film uses the toad's plight as an allegory for the displacement and cultural erosion facing Puerto Ricans due to gentrification and outside investment. The project has resonated globally, with its themes of loss and resilience being adopted by various communities facing similar struggles. The increased visibility has also led to a surge in donations for the toad's conservation, turning the amphibian into a figurehead for cultural preservation.</p>

          <p>As the June jobs report approaches, economists are considering the impact of federal layoffs resulting from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. With hundreds of thousands of federal workers seeking new employment, there is concern they are entering a cooling labor market, especially for white-collar roles where demand has weakened. Data from Indeed shows a 150% surge in applications from former federal employees, while private sector hiring has shown signs of contraction. These layoffs could become a more significant factor in national employment figures, adding a layer of complexity to the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill contains a provision that would impose a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits that offer abortions. Since many Planned Parenthood clinics are in states that protect abortion rights and have large Medicaid populations, they would be disproportionately affected.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to more than double the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is intended to make California more competitive and prevent productions from relocating to other states and countries that offer more lucrative incentives. This boost aims to stimulate an industry that has slowed due to strikes, spending cutbacks, and other recent challenges. A related bill is also under consideration to expand the types of productions eligible for the credit, further strengthening the state's effort to keep Hollywood jobs at home.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology doctoral student, has pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students in November 2022, avoiding a potential death penalty. In court, Kohberger admitted to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, waiving his right to appeal. The plea deal brings a conclusion to a case that garnered intense public interest, sparing the victims' families a lengthy and painful trial process. Prosecutors outlined the strong evidence they would have presented, including DNA from a knife sheath found at the scene that was matched to Kohberger.</p>

          <p>India captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century to lead his team to a solid position of 310-5 at the close of day one of the second Test against England. After England chose to bowl first, their bowlers battled hard on a flat pitch, with Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse taking key wickets. However, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal's elegant 87 and Gill's steadying innings ensured India remained in control. Gill's unbeaten hundred, his second in as many matches, combined with a late partnership with Ravindra Jadeja, has set a strong foundation for the tourists.</p>
