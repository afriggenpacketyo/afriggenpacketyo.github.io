          <p>Elijah Heacock, a teenager, died by suicide after being blackmailed with an A.I.-generated nude photo of himself. The scammer demanded $3,000 to prevent the image from being sent to his friends and family. This incident highlights the growing threat of sextortion scams, where perpetrators use explicit images, often generated by A.I., to extort money or coerce victims. Elijah's parents are advocating for change and hope the "Take It Down" Act, which makes posting fake sexually explicit images online a federal crime, will make a difference.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, was found to have a second chordoma on her spine during an MRI scan. Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed the spinal tumor through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The procedure, developed by Dr. Mohamed Labib, involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of the eye socket to reach the tumor. This innovative approach allowed for the complete removal of the tumor without causing external scars.</p>

          <p>Harvard-trained educator Angela Duckworth suggests that students who learn how to effectively use AI can become smarter adults, provided they avoid the mistake of mindlessly copying and pasting AI-generated answers. She advises educators and parents to show children how to use AI by asking follow-up questions to understand how chatbots arrive at their conclusions. Duckworth believes that AI can be a coach rather than a crutch, teaching by example and helping students reach a deeper level of understanding. She also mentions that AI should be used for tasks that do not involve the final product, such as creating a bullet-point outline for a writing project.</p>
