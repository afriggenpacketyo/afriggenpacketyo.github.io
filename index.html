          <p>Grammy-winning singer Michael Bolton's daughters revealed that unusual symptoms, including bowling out of turn and falling from a chair, preceded his diagnosis of glioblastoma in December 2023. These symptoms, initially dismissed as fatigue or stress, prompted an MRI that revealed the tumor. Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer known for its rapid development and resistance to treatment due to the blood-brain barrier. Bolton underwent surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy and is undergoing ongoing MRIs, with experts noting that clinical trials offer hope for improved treatments. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Psychiatrist Awais Aftab highlights the often-overlooked challenges of antidepressant withdrawal, noting that many patients experience sexual side effects, manic episodes, or severe withdrawal symptoms. Despite the widespread use of antidepressants, there is a lack of high-quality research to guide clinicians in safely tapering patients off these medications, leading many to seek help from online communities. Aftab argues that the medical community must engage seriously with patients' concerns and provide advice about psychiatric medications that acknowledges both benefits and trade-offs, lest the conversation be ceded to those who exploit suffering for political gain. The article underscores the need for scientific transparency and more research into medication safety.</p>

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is experiencing a decline in consumer sentiment, with fewer customers and altered eating habits. Rising costs and economic uncertainty are causing people to share meals, take leftovers home, and opt for cheaper options. The owner has paused expansion plans and faces staffing challenges as workers seek flexibility in the gig economy. While food prices have remained relatively stable, corporate executives expect to raise prices due to tariffs, leading to cutbacks in hiring and capital investments. Optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured victory in a chaotic, wet-dry Miami Grand Prix sprint race, overcoming teammate Oscar Piastri with the help of a safety car. Piastri had led from the start after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car, triggered by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, allowed Norris to pit and rejoin in the lead. Max Verstappen, who initially finished fourth, was penalized for an unsafe pit release that caused a collision with Antonelli, dropping him to last place. Antonelli's race was also compromised by the incident, preventing him from scoring points.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which could significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. This action, part of President Trump's plan to promote domestic manufacturing, follows earlier tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs on parts will not apply to components from Canada or Mexico that meet North American trade agreement requirements. Automakers and suppliers say it will take years to relocate assembly lines, and the uncertainty is creating headaches for carmakers, with GM estimating the tariffs would cost it up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term in Australia, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's shortcomings during the campaign. Albanese's Labor Party won a majority of seats, focusing on energy policy and inflation, while accusing the opposition of mimicking U.S. President Trump's divisive politics. The U.S. congratulated Albanese on his re-election, emphasizing the strong alliance and shared values between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) is on track to win another sweeping victory in the general elections, reinforcing its long-standing governance since 1959. According to sample vote counts, the PAP is projected to win 87 seats in Parliament, with the Workers Party retaining 10 seats. This result strengthens the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who faced his first test at the ballot box since taking office last year. Voters' concerns included living costs and housing availability, with the opposition arguing for more scrutiny of the PAP's actions.</p>
