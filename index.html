          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has framed the upcoming summit between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as a crucial test of Putin's seriousness in ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking to ABC News, Rutte emphasized that the meeting will focus on security guarantees and Ukraine's sovereign right to determine its own future, a position he believes Trump supports. The NATO chief also acknowledged the reality of Russian-controlled territory, indicating that negotiations will need to address a path forward from a potential ceasefire and what that entails for Ukraine's long-term security.</p>

          <p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is actively campaigning against the rise of internet fraud, spurred by a personal experience where his likeness was used in a YouTube video to scam users out of bitcoin. Wozniak has filed a five-year-long lawsuit against YouTube, arguing the platform fails to adequately protect consumers from such fraudulent content, a legal battle complicated by Section 230 protections for online publishers. He expresses concern that while the internet was meant to democratize information, it has been exploited by companies for profit and by criminals for scams, with insufficient measures in place to combat the growing threat.</p>

          <p>Enthusiasm for cryptocurrency is surging in Washington and on Wall Street, with the Trump administration showing increased support and major legislation under consideration. The industry has invested heavily in lobbying and political campaigns, leading to a more favorable regulatory environment, including the recent Genius Act. However, critics like former SEC official Amanda Fischer warn that crypto is highly volatile and speculative, comparing the current craze to the subprime mortgage crisis and cautioning that consumers are vulnerable to widespread scams and losses. The article also notes the Trump family's significant financial gains from crypto ventures, raising ethical questions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Powerful storms swept through eastern Nebraska, causing one death and one serious injury at a state park when a large tree crushed a vehicle. The high winds, with gusts over 80 mph, also caused significant damage to two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, leading to the displacement of 387 inmates. The severe weather extended across the Midwest, with flooding in Wisconsin and alerts for extreme heat and fire conditions for over 40 million Americans across several states.

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to take a 13-month sabbatical in Taiwan with their young son, Forrest. Their primary motivation was to allow Forrest to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to experience a different lifestyle, free from a demanding work culture. During their time abroad, Jason focused on his mental and physical health, leading to a realization that their family could be happier with less income and more flexibility. The transformative journey also included the birth of their second child, solidifying their decision to prioritize family and well-being.</p>

In his 29 minutes of play, Son drew a crucial penalty that led to LAFC's equalizing goal, though he expressed disappointment that the team didn't secure a win. The former Tottenham player, who signed for a reported MLS record transfer fee, was warmly welcomed by fans in Chicago, a reception he noted was a pleasant change from the hostile crowds he often faced in the Premier League.</p>

Protesters deliberately courted arrest by displaying signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," arguing the ban infringes on freedom of speech and the right to protest.

          <p>Albania is emerging as a top, yet often overlooked, destination for Americans seeking to move abroad, according to an expert who helps women relocate to Europe. The country's appeal lies in its surprising affordability, with low costs for rent and healthcare, and its stunning natural beauty, from the Alps to the Ionian coast. A significant advantage is that Americans can live in Albania visa-free for up to a year, making it an ideal place to "test drive" life overseas. With a welcoming local culture and a growing expatriate community, Albania offers a high quality of life that is increasingly unattainable in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>The Reason Behind the Airbus A340's Four Smaller Engines Explained</h2>

          <p>The Airbus A340 was designed with four smaller engines, in contrast to its sibling the A330's two larger ones, primarily to appeal to airlines that preferred the redundancy of four engines for long-haul flights over oceans. In the early 1990s, when the A340 was developed, regulations for twin-engine jets were much stricter, limiting how far they could fly from a diversion airport. However, the reliability of modern twin-engine aircraft has dramatically improved, and they now have ETOPS ratings that allow for extended overwater flights, making the four-engine design less necessary and more costly to operate, which has led to its decline in popularity.</p>

          <p>A sweeping tax and spending bill signed by President Trump is becoming a central issue for both parties ahead of the August congressional recess and the 2026 midterms. The legislation extends tax cuts, funds mass deportations, and imposes work requirements for programs like Medicaid. Republicans are championing the bill as a win for working-class Americans, while Democrats are highlighting its cuts to social safety nets and the fact it will cause millions to lose healthcare subsidies. With control of the House at stake, Democrats are betting the bill's unpopular provisions will help them regain a majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has issued an apology after two blind women were left behind by their flight from New Orleans to Orlando, which had been significantly delayed. While the airline rebooked most passengers on an earlier flight from a different gate, the two women, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, were not verbally notified and could not see the updated gate information. They ended up being the only two passengers on the original, now-empty aircraft. The women shared their story to advocate for improved communication protocols for passengers with disabilities, and Southwest offered them each a $100 voucher for the inconvenience.</p>

The exhibition, "Libertad," incorporates oral histories, including that of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old after soldiers in Havana destroyed his teddy bear. The refurbished landmark, owned by Miami-Dade College, aims to create an immersive experience that tells the story of seeking freedom and opportunity, preserving the human tales of survival, hope, and the challenges faced by the exiles who helped shape modern Miami.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision within President Trump's new major spending bill is causing confusion and skepticism among service industry workers. The measure offers a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tip income, but workers will still owe state and payroll taxes. Key details remain unclear, such as which occupations qualify and how employers must report the tips for them to be eligible for the deduction. Some workers feel the benefit sounds "too good to be true," while others are concerned their peers misunderstand that it is a deduction, not a complete exemption from all taxes.

          <p>In a significant policy move, the Trump administration has directed NASA to develop and place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade. This initiative is seen as essential for establishing a permanent human settlement on the lunar surface, as nuclear power would be necessary to sustain a base through the 14-day lunar nights. The push is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor. This renewed focus on the moon could enable a more accessible form of space exploration and grander scientific projects.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley explores her life in the "middle place" of eating disorder recovery, a space between acute illness and a complete cure. Tarpley, who was diagnosed with anorexia at 13, argues against the perfectionist, all-or-nothing approach to recovery that she once pursued. Instead, she advocates for a more realistic mindset that normalizes and accepts occasional slips, allowing for forward momentum and a full life without the shame of not being "fully recovered." This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture re-emerges, and many people with eating disorders find themselves in this long-term, imperfect state of recovery.</p>

This represents the highest daily number since a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France began, which allows the UK to return some migrants in exchange for accepting an equal number of asylum seekers with legitimate claims. The crossings occurred amid increasing political pressure on the UK government over illegal immigration and on the same day as several related protests across the country.

          <p>Drawing on the memory of her grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who escaped the Warsaw ghetto, the author argues for the universal right to be free from hunger. She connects her grandmother's trauma and the Jewish historical experience of persecution to the current starvation crisis in Gaza, where thousands face malnutrition due to blockades and aid disruption. The author contends that while debates over terminology like "genocide" are important, the immediate, stupifying reality of hunger demands action. She posits that food and water for all must come before security for some, and that our shared intergenerational grief should compel a focus on the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Researchers at UCLA are in limbo after the Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal grant funding, a move the University of California president called a "death knell" for research. The freeze, affecting over 800 grants, followed a Department of Justice finding that UCLA inadequately responded to antisemitism on campus. Scientists working on breakthroughs in cancer, disease diagnostics, and mathematics now face uncertainty about their projects and the salaries of their staff and graduate students. While no layoffs have been announced, faculty are scrambling to find alternative funding and fear a potential brain drain as the academic community grapples with the abrupt cuts.</p>

          <p>Despite being a symbolic battleground for immigration enforcement, California has not been the epicenter of ICE arrests during the first five months of President Trump's second term. An analysis of federal data shows that Texas and Florida had significantly more arrests, both in total numbers and relative to their populations. Experts attribute this to greater cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in Republican-led states. While arrests in California did increase dramatically, particularly in Los Angeles, the lack of state and local cooperation forced ICE to conduct more visible and controversial street-level raids, which in turn sparked significant community resistance.</p>
