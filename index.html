Cramer highlighted their innovative capabilities, such as Meta's strategic acquisitions and Apple's new health features, suggesting that these giants are well-positioned to overcome challenges and maintain their market dominance.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a proposal the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now actively reviewing. Trump argued the change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, a sentiment echoed by figures like Warren Buffett in the past. While supporters believe this could foster more sustainable growth, critics argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency and timeliness for investors who rely on the data.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, setting him up for a final confirmation. His potential appointment, occurring just before a pivotal Fed meeting on interest rates, has raised concerns among Democrats about the central bank's independence. Critics worry that Miran, who plans to take an unpaid leave from his role as a White House economic advisor, could unduly influence the Fed's decisions while simultaneously serving the president.</p>

          <p>Valentino Luchin, a well-known 62-year-old chef in the San Francisco Bay Area, has been arrested for allegedly robbing three banks in a single day. Police say Luchin passed notes demanding money to tellers at three different locations on September 10 before being identified and apprehended. This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, Luchin admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his acclaimed restaurant closed down, a situation that has seemingly resurfaced with these new allegations.</p>

          <p>Researchers are releasing a nontoxic, fluorescent pink dye into the waters of Santa Monica Bay to study ocean circulation and its effect on the area's notoriously poor water quality. The study, a collaboration between UCLA and Heal the Bay, aims to understand how a man-made breakwater from the 1930s may be trapping pollutants near the Santa Monica Pier. By tracking the dye's movement, scientists hope to gather data that could lead to solutions for the persistent bacterial contamination that plagues one of California's most famous beaches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commented on the brutal killing of a Dallas motel manager, linking the crime to the immigration system and blaming the previous administration. The suspect, a Cuban national named Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, was in the U.S. illegally and had a prior arrest history but was released from detention because Cuba would not accept his deportation. Trump used the case to advocate for his administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies, while a former Biden official noted the suspect's release order was issued just before Trump took office.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Tesla board's proposal for a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth nearly $900 billion if the company reaches an $8.5 trillion valuation. The plan is seen as an attempt to incentivize the famously mercurial CEO to dedicate his attention to Tesla amidst his growing number of other companies and political activities. The author suggests the board believes Musk's personal brand is inextricably linked to Tesla's high valuation, making it necessary to offer an "obscene" amount of money to ensure he doesn't turn his focus elsewhere.

          <p>At a United Nations forum, China's ambassador Fu Cong delivered a sharp critique of unilateralism, which he claimed is dealing "severe blows" to global cooperation. Without explicitly naming the United States, his remarks were clearly aimed at the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, which has seen the U.S. withdraw from international agreements and UN agencies. Fu emphasized that global governance should not involve "tearing down the current system," positioning China as a defender of multilateralism as world leaders gathered for the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed that the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law" will be introduced to Parliament and will include a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. This landmark legislation, born from the decades-long justice campaign by families of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster victims, aims to end a "culture of cover-ups" and ensure legal funding for those affected by state-related tragedies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law would change the balance of power between the state and its citizens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the history behind the "Hillsborough Law," a new bill aimed at ensuring accountability from public bodies after major disasters. It traces the 36-year struggle for justice by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 stadium crush, from the initial flawed inquests to the eventual 2016 verdict of unlawful killing. The law was conceived to address two key injustices exposed by the long legal battles: the lack of a legal duty for officials to be truthful and the severe imbalance in legal funding between state bodies and victims' families.</p>

          <p>Another endangered Southern Resident orca, identified as J36, has been observed carrying her dead newborn calf in the waters of Washington's Salish Sea. This behavior, which researchers suggest may be a form of grieving or an attempt at revival, mirrors the highly publicized tour of grief undertaken by another orca, Tahlequah, in 2018. The incident underscores the severe challenges facing this population of 73 remaining whales, which struggles with high calf mortality due to a lack of prey, pollution, and vessel noise.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, with voters overwhelmingly citing the city's unaffordability as their top concern. The poll suggests a strong desire for change over experience, which benefits Mamdani, while former Governor Andrew Cuomo performs better among voters focused on crime. The influence of national politics is also a factor, as many voters, particularly Mamdani's supporters, want a mayor who will oppose President Trump rather than cooperate with him.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's deployment of federal forces to combat crime in Washington, D.C., may be counterproductive in the long run. While short-term crime statistics may show a decline, the crackdown is having a negative economic impact and is eroding trust between the community and law enforcement, particularly among immigrant populations. The article suggests that by cutting funding for community-based violence prevention programs and creating a hostile environment, the federal surge could ultimately engineer the very disorder it claims to be fighting.</p>
