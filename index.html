          <h2>British MPs Denied Entry to Israel Amidst West Bank Visit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel while attempting to visit the West Bank, sparking criticism from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy who called the move unacceptable. Israeli authorities accused the MPs of intending to "spread hate speech" against Israel, a claim the MPs refuted, stating the trip was organized with UK charities to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. The MPs, both elected in 2024, have been vocal about the Israel-Palestine conflict in Parliament, advocating for compliance with international humanitarian law and criticizing Israel's actions in Gaza. The incident has led to a debate over countries' rights to control borders versus the importance of allowing parliamentarians to witness and speak truthfully about international issues.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Explains Causes and Remedies for Chronic Throat Clearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 05:00:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Laryngologist Dr. Inna Husain explains that chronic throat clearing, a common reflex, can become a harmful habit that damages vocal folds and increases throat sensitivity. One cause is laryngeal pharyngeal reflux (LPR), or "silent reflux," where stomach contents irritate the throat without heartburn symptoms. Other causes include allergies, sinusitis, vocal cord issues, aging, asthma, tracheal narrowing, and some medications. Dr. Husain recommends identifying the root cause through an ENT exam, staying hydrated, avoiding smoking and acidic foods, and using saline nebulizers; alternate behaviors like swallowing or humming can also help the throat heal.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. Published just before a devastating earthquake struck Myanmar, the research analyzes 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake "active periods" correlated with shifts in Earth's rotational speed and tectonic stress realignments. The timing of the research has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase.</p>

          <p>Kenan Malik reviews Joel Budd's book, 'Underdogs,' which examines the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness stems less from ethnicity and more from geography and neglect by national politicians. The book highlights the diversity within the white working class, distinguishing between "heartlands," "enclaves," and "colonies," and questions myths surrounding immigration attitudes. Budd's analysis challenges the notion of a homogeneous white working class, emphasizing the importance of recognizing both its distinctiveness and diversity. The review also critiques the left's neglect of class politics, which has allowed regressive parties to portray themselves as champions of working-class interests.</p>

          <p>Will Hutton argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's trade policies but should instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond to sustain a rules-based global trading system. He suggests combining with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to forge a new global trade order, with Canada playing a pivotal role. This would involve associating Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extending the terms to a newly relevant commonwealth, while also imposing sanctions on selected US service exports and challenging US monopoly digital platforms. Hutton emphasizes the need for Britain to introduce a defence levy and lift public investment to offset potential recessionary impacts.</p>

          <p>Sales of Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) striped merchandise have skyrocketed since the announcement of nationwide department store liquidations, turning the iconic stripes into a sought-after symbol of Canadian heritage. Blankets, originally retailed for around C$300, are now being sold for over C$1,000 on eBay, reflecting a surge in national pride and a movement to "buy Canadian" amidst US tariffs. Founded in 1670, HBC's striped woolen blankets became a symbol of Canada's rugged past, but the company's fortunes declined as department stores lost ground to online shopping, leading to the liquidation of numerous stores.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban has warned that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with DOGE cuts, could cause long-term economic harm "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis.

He cited the potential for inflationary pressures and the targeting of agencies like the CFPB and the IRS as contributing factors.</p>
