          <p>A grandfather and grandmother in Flintshire, Wales, have been found guilty of murdering their two-year-old grandson, Ethan Ives-Griffiths. The toddler died in August 2021 from a catastrophic head injury while suffering from severe neglect, dehydration, and abuse. The boy's mother was also convicted of causing or allowing his death. A judge stated that the grandparents face mandatory life sentences for the crime, which a detective described as behavior beyond comprehension.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to a 2.7% annual rate in June, marking its highest level since February and signaling rising inflationary pressures. This figure, driven by factors including housing and energy costs, met economists' forecasts, while the monthly increase of 0.3% was the largest since January. The data suggests that recently imposed tariffs may be starting to affect consumer prices, although analysts note that underlying inflation remains relatively contained for now.

          <p>A major investigation has revealed that a 2022 Ministry of Defence data breach, which exposed the details of over 18,000 Afghan applicants seeking UK relocation, prompted a massive and secret resettlement operation. The government obtained an unprecedented superinjunction to prevent media from reporting on the leak and the subsequent program, which is projected to cost billions. The story, now public after a lengthy legal battle, details the scramble to protect lives and the decision to create a new resettlement scheme as 'cover' for the evacuation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the BBC's annual salary report reveals that many of its highest-paid and most prominent stars are not included on the public list. This is because the disclosure requirements only apply to talent directly employed by the BBC, not those hired by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Consequently, the earnings of stars from major shows like "Strictly Come Dancing," "The Traitors," and "The Apprentice" remain private, presenting an incomplete picture of the corporation's talent expenditure.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has officially declared a drought in the East and West Midlands regions of England, following the country's driest start to the year since 1976. The prolonged period of hot, dry weather has left many rivers at critically low levels, impacting both the environment and agriculture. This declaration serves as a public signal that water companies may need to introduce restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, to manage dwindling water supplies if the dry conditions persist.</p>

          <p>China's top leadership has signaled a fundamental shift in the country's approach to urban development, moving away from large-scale expansion towards enhancing existing cities. At a rare high-level meeting, officials emphasized the need to focus on improving quality of life, renovating urban villages, and providing more benefits to migrant workers. This new strategy reflects China's entry into a more stable phase of urbanization and aims to create a more sustainable and people-centric growth model for its sprawling cities.</p>

By analyzing gravity anomalies detected by NASA's GRACE satellites, the researchers identified areas along the Ninety East Ridge with unusually thick crust, which are often rich in valuable minerals. This innovative use of open-source data has potentially saved the research team years of exploration and millions of dollars in costs, highlighting the benefits of international data sharing.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to offer drivers discounts of up to £3,750 on the purchase of new electric cars. The plan, funded with £650 million, applies to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and is designed to encourage the shift away from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 sales ban. While the move is welcomed by manufacturers, some critics argue that the country's charging infrastructure remains insufficient to support a widespread transition to EVs.</p>

          <p>A review of Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest book, "Girl, 1983," praises it as a deft exploration of memory, amnesia, and trauma. Though labeled a novel, the work is deeply autobiographical, chronicling a 16-year-old's relationship with a much older photographer in the 1980s. The article notes how Ullmann subverts genre conventions not by filling memory gaps with fiction, but by embracing them as central to the narrative. This approach challenges the idea that any autobiography can be a complete, factual record, suggesting all personal histories are shaped by what is forgotten.</p>
