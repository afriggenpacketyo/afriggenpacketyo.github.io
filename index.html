          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. fell in June, dropping more than analysts expected due to persistently high mortgage rates that deter potential buyers. Despite the slowdown in sales volume, the median home price reached another record high for the month, driven by a chronic undersupply of available properties. According to the National Association of Realtors, this ongoing inventory shortage continues to fuel price growth, particularly for higher-end homes, while sales in lower price brackets have declined.

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to gain sole custody of their child, while the defense maintained she acted in self-defense after years of abuse. The jury ultimately convicted her of the lesser charge rather than second-degree murder, concluding a trial that detailed their turbulent relationship and competing narratives of manipulation and fear.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice has ruled that countries have a legal obligation under international law to protect the climate system and can be sued for climate-related damages. The decision clears the way for legal action against nations for their contributions to climate change, including historical emissions. While non-binding, the ruling is considered a major victory for climate-vulnerable countries that have been advocating for greater accountability from high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>At a contentious congressional hearing, acting FEMA director David Richardson defended his agency's handling of recent deadly floods in Texas, calling the response a "model" for how disasters should be managed. His comments came as he faced accusations from lawmakers of incompetence and indifference, citing reports that the agency failed to answer a majority of calls to its disaster hotline. Richardson denied any wrongdoing and emphasized a new focus on shifting more responsibility to state governments.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has warned retail investors to stay away from the recent revival of meme stock trading, which has seen speculative surges in companies like Kohl's and Krispy Kreme. He contrasted this high-risk activity with what he termed legitimate investment strategies, such as focusing on companies with strong fundamentals like GE Vernova, which recently reported excellent earnings. Cramer expressed concern that the speculative "meme problem" has returned to the market. (not investment advice)</p>
