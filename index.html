          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his shock and frustration regarding a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, especially after activists recently broke into RAF Brize Norton. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the importance of the right to protest but condemned actions supporting what he described as an "organised extremist criminal group." While the Met lacks the legal authority to prevent the protest before the group is proscribed, conditions have been imposed to manage potential disorder and disruption, restricting the protest to a specific time and location, and the Met will address any breaches of the law robustly. The protest is confirmed to take place in Trafalgar Square, with Palestine Action denouncing government plans to proscribe the group as "absurd."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to launch a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from certain green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. Other measures involve upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi has called for a diplomatic solution and de-escalation of the conflict in Iran during an emergency board meeting. Grossi emphasized the need for calm to allow IAEA inspectors access to Iran's nuclear sites to assess damage from recent attacks. He stated that no one has fully assessed the underground damage at the Fordo site, suggesting significant damage is expected due to the nature of the explosives used and the sensitivity of centrifuges. Grossi's statements highlight the urgency of ensuring transparency and preventing further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Tokyo Olympic judo gold medalist Aaron Wolf has announced his transition to professional wrestling, joining New Japan Pro Wrestling after retiring from judo earlier this month. Wolf, who won gold in the men's 100-kilogram judo event at the 2021 Olympics, will debut at a New Japan event at Tokyo Dome in January. A longtime fan of professional wrestling, Wolf decided to make the switch after last summer's Olympics, expressing excitement about challenging himself on a new stage.

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of widespread AI use in student writing, questioning the value of strict enforcement in a system students don't take seriously. The author suggests that the true value of humanities education lies in character development, not merely the production of academic work. She proposes integrating AI into the curriculum by allowing students to use it but requiring them to reflect on how it affects their thinking and learning. By adding friction back into the learning process, educators can help students cultivate practical wisdom, essential for navigating the complex choices presented by emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has praised the Houston Rockets for their reported trade acquisition of Kevin Durant from the Phoenix Suns. The trade involves Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2025 draft, and five second-round picks going to the Suns, with the deal expected to be official in July. Cruz acknowledged the loss of Brooks but highlighted Durant's value as a player, congratulating the Rockets on the trade.

          <p>A proposed bill in the Senate, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is drawing criticism for its provisions that would require asylum seekers to pay a $1,000 fee to have their claims heard. Critics argue that this fee would create a two-tiered system, disadvantaging poor asylum seekers who are unable to pay and effectively denying them their right to seek refuge. The bill also includes additional fees for work permits and prolonged application processing, further burdening those fleeing persecution. Additionally, the legislation proposes significant funding increases for immigration enforcement and border security, while simultaneously restricting access to asylum and refugee programs.</p>

Despite increased European military spending and rising tensions with the US, Chinese defense firms are expected to face challenges in winning over European buyers. Political skepticism towards China is likely to maintain the United States' dominance in fighter jet sales in Europe, and encourage further investment in the European aerospace industry.

          <p>An analyst argues that Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, made a critical miscalculation by underestimating Israel's resolve and overestimating the capabilities of the Iranian-led "Axis of Resistance." The October 7 massacre, ordered by Sinwar, did not lead to Israel's destruction but rather to the dismantling of Hamas and the weakening of its allies. The author suggests that Sinwar's misjudgment stemmed from a flawed understanding of Israeli identity and a reliance on conspiracy theories. The long-term consequences of the conflict remain uncertain, but the author asserts that the existential threat posed to Israel by the Iranian regime has been significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>A surge in pancreas harvesting for research in the US is attributed to a 2004 law and subsequent regulations concerning organ procurement organizations (OPOs). A 2021 rule incentivized OPOs to collect more organs, including pancreata for research, to improve their certification scores. This led to a dramatic increase in research pancreata, with questions arising about their ultimate use and impact on organ transplantation efforts. The situation highlights unintended consequences of well-intentioned regulations and the need for a more effective approach to increasing organ supply for both research and transplantation.</p>

          <h2>Trump Sues to End College Tuition Benefits for Undocumented Students; California Could Be Next</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, raising concerns in California, where a 24-year-old law grants these benefits. Lawsuits in Texas and Kentucky allege violations of federal law, prompting fears that California's similar policy may be targeted next. The potential loss of in-state tuition would significantly impact undocumented students, making college unaffordable for many. Legal experts anticipate a battle in California, where the state is expected to strongly resist the challenge. The challenge to these policies have sparked outrage and concern among students and advocates.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for limited-English-proficient voters, which could potentially increase voter turnout. The survey, conducted in multiple languages, found strong support across various demographics, with Democrats and independent voters particularly in favor. While current laws mandate bilingual voting assistance for Spanish speakers, and some counties offer materials in other languages, many believe that official ballots should be available in voters' preferred languages. Legislation aimed at expanding translated ballot access has faced challenges, but advocates emphasize the importance of accessible voting materials in a state with a diverse electorate and complex ballot measures.</p>

Regime change, achieved through military intervention, is likely to backfire, potentially leading to a more belligerent government. The author contends that Iranians, regardless of their feelings toward the current regime, are united in their patriotic defense of Iran against foreign interference. The article suggests that diplomacy and dialogue are the best path forward, warning that military action only strengthens the resolve of Iranians to defend their nation.</p>

          <p>Despite emerging tensions within Donald Trump's coalition, fueled by disagreements over tariffs, immigration, and foreign policy, the author argues that these rifts are unlikely to significantly impact Trump's support. While elite-level disagreements exist, the actual Trump voter base remains primarily focused on Trump himself, rather than specific policies or ideologies. Trump's resistance to ideological constraints allows him to shift positions based on personal whims or the influence of advisors. The article suggests that the absence of a coherent Trump Doctrine underscores the dominance of Trump's personality over policy considerations.</p>
