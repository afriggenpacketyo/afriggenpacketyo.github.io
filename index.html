          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:36:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, now an independent MP, has announced the formation of a new political party aimed at providing an alternative to the current UK political system. Co-founded with independent MP Zarah Sultana, the yet-unnamed party will campaign for a mass redistribution of wealth and address issues like child poverty and corporate profits. Corbyn described the new venture as a community-led, grassroots movement, contrasting it with what he called the "top-down" control of the Labour Party. The party's inaugural conference is planned for the autumn to establish its platform and policies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged, marking its entry into the recent wave of meme stock rallies. The jump is linked to a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and significant interest from retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its shares sold short, makes it a target for a potential short squeeze. This rally offers a temporary reprieve for the company's stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:35:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three British citizens have been sentenced to 12 months in prison for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, thereby avoiding a potential death penalty. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after the drugs, valued at around £300,000, were discovered hidden in packets of a powdered dessert mix. Under Indonesian law, drug trafficking can carry the death sentence, but the country has maintained a temporary halt on executions since 2017. With time already served, the three could be released in early 2026.</p>

          <p>Despite a US-brokered truce between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the M23 rebel group, there is widespread doubt about the potential for lasting peace in the region. The Doha Declaration of Principles was intended to stabilize the conflict, but fresh reports indicate M23 rebels have continued to seize new territory and kill civilians, violating the agreement. Analysts note the deal lacks a mandatory withdrawal clause, and an M23 leader publicly stated the group will not retreat. This ongoing aggression and the ambiguity of the agreement have led conflict experts and local citizens to believe the truce will have little long-term effect on the violence.</p>

The issue gained prominence after Delta Air Lines announced plans to expand its use of AI to set individual fares, sparking backlash and prompting a proposed federal ban.

Furthermore, AI systems are deeply integrated into global infrastructure, and any attempt to shut them down via extreme measures like an EMP or grid shutdown would cause a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Researchers stress the focus must be on governance and instilling benevolent values in AI, rather than on a failsafe that likely cannot exist.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared that the TikTok app will "go dark" for American users unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to a deal that gives the U.S. control over its technology and algorithm. The statement reinforces the administration's hardline stance on the popular video platform, which stems from concerns that the Chinese government could access U.S. user data or manipulate content. President Trump recently extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, but Lutnick's comments suggest a shutdown is the definitive alternative if a deal that ensures American control is not reached and approved by China.</p>

          <p>A new report from the AFL-CIO reveals that the pay gap between CEOs and their workers widened in 2024, with S&P 500 CEO compensation rising 7% to an average of 285 times that of their median worker. The report highlights extreme cases, such as Starbucks' CEO earning 6,666 times the typical worker's pay. It also notes that the Trump administration's recent reconciliation bill will provide substantial tax cuts to top earners, with the average S&P 500 CEO set to receive a tax cut of nearly $500,000. This analysis underscores growing concerns about economic inequality in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines' shares fell by 10% after the carrier significantly cut its full-year profit forecast and posted second-quarter earnings that missed expectations. The airline now projects 2025 earnings before taxes to be between $600 million and $800 million, a sharp reduction from its earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. CEO Bob Jordan attributed the downgrade to weaker domestic travel demand and economic uncertainty, though he noted signs of stabilization have recently appeared. The news comes as Southwest overhauls its business model, moving away from policies like open seating to better compete in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a new draft law to guarantee the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies. The move is a reversal, coming just days after his government passed legislation that curbed the bodies' autonomy, sparking the largest nationwide protests since Russia's 2022 invasion and drawing serious concern from Western partners. Zelensky stated the new, "balanced" bill would safeguard the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) from external influence. This reversal appears to be a direct response to both domestic and international pressure.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted two former militia leaders from the Central African Republic, Alfred Yekatom and Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The two men were leaders of the predominantly Christian "anti-Balaka" militias and were found guilty of directing a campaign of murder, torture, and persecution against Muslim civilians in 2013 and 2014. Yekatom, known as "Rambo," was sentenced to a 15-year term, while Ngaissona, a former football official, received a 12-year sentence.

          <p>An Angara Airlines passenger plane has crashed in Russia's far eastern Amur region, with authorities reporting no survivors among the 48 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft, an Antonov An-24, was flying from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda when it disappeared from radar during its approach. The burning wreckage was later found on a hillside, with rescue efforts initially hampered by difficult terrain and poor weather. The Soviet-designed plane was nearly 50 years old, highlighting ongoing concerns about Russia's aging aviation fleet, which has been further strained by Western sanctions affecting the availability of spare parts.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold interest rates at 2%, pausing a year-long cycle of monetary policy easing that had seen eight consecutive cuts. The decision was widely expected as policymakers adopt a "wait and watch" approach amid significant economic uncertainty, particularly concerning future trade relations with the United States under President Trump. With inflation currently at the bank's 2% target, officials see no immediate need for further adjustments.

Now, with processing resumed, advocates argue that Palestinians should be granted full refugee status under the Geneva Convention, not just subsidiary protection. This is especially relevant as the UN agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) is unable to operate in Gaza, potentially triggering a clause that mandates full protection for those who have lost its assistance.</p>
