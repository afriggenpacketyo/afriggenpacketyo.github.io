          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released on bail after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release, citing a violation of her due process and First Amendment rights, stemming from an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk, along with Sen. Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, thanked her community for their support and expressed faith in the American justice system. The article highlights the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision to revoke her visa based on the op-ed, sparking concerns about free speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that "great progress" was made during trade negotiations with China in Geneva, describing the agreement as "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner." The talks, involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and a Chinese delegation, addressed the intense tariff battle between the two nations. While specifics remain scarce, Trump emphasized the goal of opening up China to American business, asserting that fair duties could address the nation's trade deficit and encourage the return of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Bessent previously suggested that the tariffs could cost China millions of jobs, rendering them unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transactions, attributed to efforts to defend market share.

The growth of coffee shops is concentrated in second and "new first-tier cities", like Chengdu and Hangzhou, signaling a shift in the coffee market landscape.</p>

          <p>As global trade tensions rise, Chinese consumers are increasingly favoring domestic brands as an expression of resilience and national pride. This shift reflects a deeper transition towards a domestically-driven consumption economy, driven by rising protectionism and slowing globalization. Consumption in China has evolved into an emotional and cultural act, with consumers buying into stories, values, and symbols associated with domestic brands.

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr is retiring due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. The injury, discovered during offseason training, would jeopardize the 2025 season and not guarantee a full recovery. Carr, a four-time Pro Bowler, retires with 41,245 passing yards and 257 touchdowns after 11 seasons, and cited prayer and family consultation in his decision. Following Carr's retirement, the Saints will provide Tyler Shough, their high second-round draft pick, with the opportunity to compete for the starting position, alongside Spencer Rattler and Jake Haener.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the U.S.-Canada border are experiencing economic challenges due to Trump's trade war, marked by decreased Canadian tourism and cross-border shopping. Border crossings have declined by 17% since the tariffs began, with Canadian car trips to the U.S. dropping nearly 32%. Businesses in towns like Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, are feeling the pinch as Canadians opt to "Buy Canadian" and reduce travel to the U.S. The duty-free shops are particularly affected, with some stores reporting sales decreases of up to 80% since Trump's return to the White House.</p>

          <p>Experts weigh in on the formula for Eurovision success, considering factors like song theme, staging, key, and surprise elements. Lyrical themes often revolve around love, unity, self-assertion, partying, history, and music, with self-empowering songs performing well. Simple and effective staging is preferred over overly elaborate productions, and the increasing dominance of minor-key songs suggests an association with emotional depth. A surprise twist, such as a key change or costume reveal, can also enhance a song's catchiness and memorability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration grew concerned about the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, fearing it could go nuclear, despite initial remarks from Vice President JD Vance suggesting it was "none of our business."

The U.S. officials contacted Prime Minister Modi and General Munir to de-escalate the situation, leading to a cease-fire announcement, though reports of continued firing persisted.

          <p>Five fishermen, including three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after spending 55 days adrift at sea. The Ecuadorian navy reported that the men were rescued by a tuna boat after being missing since mid-March. The fishermen reported damage to their boat's alternator shortly after setting sail, causing communication and navigation tools to malfunction. To survive, they drank rain and parboiled passing fish, and are now in stable condition as authorities coordinate their safe return home.</p>

          <p>Sunday's newspapers highlight the government's new immigration plans, with a focus on deporting migrants who commit crimes, and the scrutiny of Trump Inc. The Daily Mail reports that the Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of any offense, granting officials wider powers to remove them from the UK. The Sunday Times leads with a story on businessman Graham King, known as the "Asylum King," who has become a billionaire due to his migrant-housing firm, while The Observer features a striking photo of the Trump family and their spouses with a piece inside the paper, reads "The firm: Trump Inc and the new age of corruption".</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of new sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in the coming days. This proposal followed a visit by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland to Kyiv, where they stated that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions if Putin refused to agree to a 30-day cease-fire. Putin suggested a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, aiming to “eliminate the root causes of the conflict” without preconditions.</p>

          <p>China's export controls on rare earth elements, critical for manufacturing military and commercial products, are causing concern in the U.S. defense industry. These restrictions, implemented in retaliation for Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods, affect key technologies used in military equipment like jet engines and radar systems. China dominates the global supply of rare earths, accounting for 90% of production capacity. The export controls target seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, and dysprosium.</p>

The Kentucky Board of Stewards issued the ruling, citing Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, which doubled the fine under HISA's escalating penalty structure. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes, with all jockey crop fines directed to a jockey mental health program.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, was convicted of 23 felony counts of financial fraud after offering the victim so-called "investment opportunities" with promised 10% interest and "no risk." Prosecutors revealed that Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and support a lavish lifestyle.
