          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized Israeli authorities for denying entry to Labour MPs Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, calling the action unacceptable and counterproductive. Israeli authorities stated the MPs intended to spread hateful rhetoric against Israel.

          <p>The Tennessee Titans have reportedly canceled a private workout with Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, fueling speculation about their top draft pick. Cam Ward is now considered the frontrunner, while Sanders' draft stock may be falling. The Titans attended Sanders' pro day and have been evaluating him for four years, but ultimately decided against the private workout. Sanders played a key role in turning around the Buffaloes football program, and there is speculation that the New York Giants are big fans of Sanders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging a judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing that the court lacks the authority to compel such action.

Abrego Garcia, who had protection from deportation, was sent to a notorious El Salvador prison due to an administrative error.

Police responded to the scene, evacuating the East Block and establishing a large presence. The Parliamentary Protective Service issued an emergency alert, urging people to seek shelter and avoid the area. The situation is reportedly contained, but law enforcement is treating it as a potential worst-case scenario.

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Erez Reuveni, the acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was deemed to have failed to zealously advocate for the government's interests. The government is seeking to appeal a judge's order to facilitate the man's return. Reuveni's inability to answer questions about the deportation prompted his placement on leave.</p>

          <p>As the European Union navigates a turbulent world, it is reevaluating its position in the wake of a shifting global order. The return of Donald Trump has led many to believe that the post-war era, which allowed Europe to thrive, has ended. The European Commission has even urged citizens to stockpile a three-day survival kit, reflecting a sense of instability. A debate has begun in Europe's capitals about the EU's role in a multipolar world, particularly after benefiting from the U.S.-led Western order for 80 years.</p>

          <p>The US began collecting a 10% tariff on all imports, prompting President Donald Trump to urge Americans to "hang tough" despite market volatility. The UK, France, and China are among the countries impacted by the tariffs, with China announcing retaliatory measures. Billionaire Elon Musk suggested a potential zero-tariff situation between the US and Europe. The tariffs have caused significant market turmoil, with major stock indexes plunging. Protests against Trump's policies have also erupted in several cities.</p>

          <p>As the United States grapples with the consequences of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on numerous countries, a conservative organization has filed a lawsuit challenging the president's authority to enact these levies. The New Civil Liberties Alliance argues that Trump lacked the necessary authority to impose the tariffs on Chinese imports. Similar legal challenges could potentially disrupt Trump's broader tariff policies, representing a significant threat to his economic agenda. The outcome of these legal battles remains uncertain.</p>
