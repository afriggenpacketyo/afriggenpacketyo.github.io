          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List reveals a decline in the number of UK billionaires, alongside an increase in King Charles' personal wealth. The number of billionaires has fallen from 165 to 156, marking the sharpest decline in the list's history, which compilers attribute to criticism of tax changes by the new Labour government. Simultaneously, King Charles' wealth has grown by £30 million to £640 million, equaling the wealth of Rishi Sunak and his wife. Topping the list for the fourth consecutive year is the Hinduja family, with a fortune exceeding £35 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania is on the brink of a significant political shift as far-right candidate George Simion leads in the presidential elections. The article argues that this rise is rooted in decades of economic failure, chronic underdevelopment, and mass emigration, leading to anti-establishment anger. The author criticizes mainstream parties for not addressing the broken economic model and warns that Simion's policies, despite populist appeal, may not offer genuine economic solutions for ordinary Romanians, drawing parallels to Viktor Orban's Hungary. The article concludes that a party representing state-led job creation and better-funded public services is urgently needed.</p>

          <p>The Scotland women's cricket team, recently named their nation's team of the year, faces an uncertain future due to a lack of scheduled fixtures and financial support. Despite teams wanting to play them, prohibitive costs make organizing matches impossible, especially since the women's game for associate countries lacks a mandated Future Tours Programme. Players express frustration, feeling helpless as they cannot develop without opportunities to play. Cricket Scotland receives limited funding, making it challenging to host series and provide adequate resources for the women's program.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies.

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says is mandated by the state's abortion ban. The family is upset that Georgia's law that restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. The situation highlights the complex ethical and legal questions surrounding abortion laws and fetal rights, particularly in cases where the mother is legally deceased. Bioethicists debate whether the state can legally insist on continued life support in such circumstances.</p>

Despite the overall contraction, year-on-year GDP expanded by 1.7%, the largest expansion since the first quarter of 2023, although U.S. trade policy continues to pose downside risks.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike, halting train service and impacting daily commuters. The agency and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen have been at odds over pay raises. NJ Transit is suggesting people work from home, if possible, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says all options are on the table, even a state of emergency. NJ Transit has come up with a contingency plan for the strike, including additional bus service, but the agency's chief executive warned the plan can only handle about 20% of daily train riders.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, a medical examiner testified that John O'Keefe's cause of death was a head injury and hypothermia, but the manner of death was undetermined. The blunt impact to his head was the primary cause of death, with hypothermia contributing. The examiner found multiple skull fractures and brain bleeding, and his body temperature was significantly low upon arrival at the hospital. The defense argued that the injuries were consistent with a fall on the frozen ground, while the prosecution presented evidence of inconsistencies in the timeline.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a “shock absorber” of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances. While the climbdown in superpower tensions has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, economists say that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes. One expert suggests that Europe might not become a pole at all, but rather a shock absorber.</p>

          <p>Nissan is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. The struggling company said it would lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories but did not say where the cuts would be made. Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. The total cuts will hit 15% of its workforce as part of a cost saving effort that it said would reduce its global production by a fifth.</p>

When Mr. Trump first took office, liberals filed cases in larger venues, predominantly in the 9th Circuit, which includes most western states.</p>

          <p>After two days of testimony about how her relationship with Sean "Diddy" Combs grew violent and coercive, Cassie Ventura faced six hours of grueling cross-examination on Thursday, as defense attorneys attempted to cast doubt on her credibility and portray her as a willing participant in their sexual activities. Defense attorneys turned to a decade of archived text messages to question Ventura about the consistency of her earlier testimony, highlighting her apparent eagerness to engage in Combs' lifestyle of swinging at drug-fueled orgies. They insist that she was not a victim of sexual assault or racketeering and that Combs is innocent of the federal charges he's facing.</p>
