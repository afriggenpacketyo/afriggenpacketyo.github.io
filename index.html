          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his challenges to the election results. Griffin stated he respects the court's holding, ending his six-month effort to overturn the election. The ruling is a win for Democrats in the swing state, ensuring Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court and boosting Democrats' chances of regaining the court majority in 2028. The judge who rejected Griffin's legal challenge was appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The White House withdrew Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. surgeon general after questions arose regarding her education and credentials. Concerns were raised about her public profile on LinkedIn listing an M.D. degree from the University of Arkansas, when she received her medical degree from American University of the Caribbean in St. Maarten. Conservative activist Laura Loomer opposed Nesheiwat's confirmation due to her support for COVID-19 vaccines.

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The verdict, delivered after a nine-day trial, sparked outrage and renewed calls for police reform in the U.S. The officers still face the prospect of years in prison after being convicted on federal charges last year. The beating, captured on video, led to Nichols' death and prompted intense scrutiny of the Memphis Police Department.</p>

Carvana updated its long-term objectives and quarterly guidance, projecting a sequential increase in both retail units sold and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter. The new management objective is to sell 3 million retail units per year at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.5% within five to 10 years.</p>

The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. spy agencies were told to focus on Greenland's independence movement and American goals to extract mineral resources there. While not denying the report, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of undermining President Trump. President Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, even suggesting military force.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a climb on a report that the Trump administration plans to revise chip trade restrictions called the "AI diffusion" rule. The rule, proposed during the Biden administration, categorized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on advanced AI chip exports. Chipmakers, including Nvidia and AMD, have opposed the rule, with Nvidia's CEO stating that being locked out of the Chinese AI market would be a "tremendous loss." AMD CEO Lisa Su stated the U.S. should strike a balance between restricting access to chips for national security and providing access, which will boost the American chip industry.</p>
