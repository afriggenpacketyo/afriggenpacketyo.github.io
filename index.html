          <p>New York City police are hunting for up to four shooters following a mass shooting at a lounge in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood. The incident, believed to be gang-related, resulted in the deaths of three men and left nine other people hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Investigators recovered 42 shell casings from the scene and are reviewing surveillance footage to identify the perpetrators. Mayor Eric Adams has urged witnesses to come forward as the city mobilizes its crisis management plan to prevent potential retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and revenue generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts estimate Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs towards more profitable novel treatments. This trend is expected to significantly improve the company's revenue structure and reduce its reliance on generics in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defending champions Kristen Nuss and Taryn Brasher won the AVP Manhattan Beach Open for the second year in a row after a hard-fought final. They defeated former USC standouts Megan Kraft and Terese Cannon in a three-set thriller with a final score of 15-21, 21-18, 15-13. After losing the first set, the experienced pair rallied to overcome their opponents in a match described as the "Wimbledon" of beach volleyball.

          <p>Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead home run in the bottom of the eighth inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-4 victory and a series sweep against the San Diego Padres. The Dodgers had initially taken a four-run lead but saw it erased as the Padres tied the game in the top of the eighth. Betts' decisive swing against Padres closer Robert Suarez broke the tie, providing a much-needed moment of heroism during a challenging season for the former MVP.

          <p>The UK's Green Party is currently in a leadership race that highlights a strategic crossroads for the organization following its record success in the last general election. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, "eco-populist" approach to connect with voter anger and challenge the elite more directly. His opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the more moderate, broad-appeal strategy that has proven successful in winning seats. The outcome will determine whether the party pivots to a more radical stance or sticks with its tested formula for growth.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a sustained decline in its birth rate, which has fallen below the population replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. This demographic trend, driven by fewer births among women under 30 and delayed family planning, mirrors situations in countries like Japan and raises concerns about future economic stability. Experts point to potential challenges for Social Security, elder care, and institutions like universities, which may face a "demographic cliff" with fewer students. While the Trump administration is considering financial incentives, some analysts argue that addressing issues like childcare costs and economic confidence is more critical.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years due to a record-low birth rate and falling marriage rates. This decline poses significant threats to the nation's economy, military, and social structure, leading to labor shortages and a strain on the younger generation. The government has implemented various measures, including a state-run dating app and a four-day workweek for some employees, to encourage family formation. The article highlights how cultural factors, such as a demanding work culture and a rise in solo living, contribute to the complex challenge of reversing the population decline.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members patrolling Washington, D.C. as part of a federal crime crackdown may be armed, a shift from earlier statements. This deployment is part of President Trump's plan to assume federal control of the city's police and increase law enforcement presence, a move he claims is necessary to combat violent crime. The decision has sparked significant controversy, with Mayor Muriel Bowser and local residents protesting it as a federal overreach. Meanwhile, crime data indicates a 26% drop in violent crime compared to the previous year, fueling criticism of the administration's justification.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating allegations of drug-related offenses connected to the popular BBC show "Strictly Come Dancing." The investigation follows a report in The Sun on Sunday newspaper concerning alleged drug use by two unnamed stars associated with the program. The BBC had already launched its own internal probe, hiring a law firm to assist, before referring the matter to the police. While the show has faced various controversies in the past, this is reportedly the first time police have been involved in an investigation linked to it.</p>

          <h2>Florida Beach Towns Report Business Slump Despite State's Overall Visitor Numbers</h2>

          <p>Businesses in several Florida beach cities are reporting a significant downturn, with some calling their towns "ghost towns" and experiencing revenue drops of up to 30% this summer. This local slump appears to contradict statewide data suggesting steady visitor arrivals. Experts suggest that while people are still traveling to Florida, persistent inflation and economic uncertainty are causing American consumers to slash their travel budgets, spending less on lodging, dining, and attractions. For savvy travelers, this downturn could present an opportunity for discounts and deals in traditionally popular but currently struggling tourist spots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are facing serious concerns about the health of quarterback Matthew Stafford as the NFL season opener approaches. The 37-year-old veteran has been sidelined by a back issue and has not thrown a single pass in team practices throughout training camp. Coach Sean McVay and the organization have provided few details on Stafford's condition or a timeline for his return, increasing speculation about his availability. With the season just weeks away, backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking all the practice snaps, casting doubt on the team's Super Bowl prospects.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers who fled Texas to prevent a Republican-led special session on congressional redistricting have started to return to the state. Their departure successfully denied the GOP a legislative quorum, temporarily halting a plan that would create five more Republican-leaning U.S. House seats. With a new special session underway, Democrats are returning on their own timelines, and it is unclear if a quorum will be met on Monday. The move comes after California's governor announced a rival plan to redraw his state's districts, adding a new dimension to the national political fight over redistricting.</p>

Her defiant stance comes as Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's targeting of arms companies and alleged planning for future attacks, arguing they are not a legitimate protest group.</p>
