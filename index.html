          <p>An enigmatic Banksy mural, portraying a judge in traditional attire striking a protester, has emerged on London's Royal Courts of Justice. The artwork, which the artist authenticated via Instagram, was swiftly covered by security barriers. Its appearance follows recent protests against a ban on Palestine Action, though the mural itself doesn't explicitly reference a specific cause. Banksy's street art frequently critiques government policies, war, and capitalism.</p>

          <p>Protests against Nepal's government ban on social media platforms like Facebook and X have led to violent clashes with security forces, resulting in at least 19 deaths and numerous injuries. Thousands of "Generation Z" demonstrators gathered near parliament in Kathmandu, challenging the government's claim that the ban targets fake news and online fraud. Police used force, including water cannons and rubber bullets, as protesters attempted to breach restricted areas. The incident highlights growing public discontent over perceived authoritarianism and restrictions on digital freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A communication expert suggests that highly likable people consistently make others feel seen and valued, rather than simply being "fake nice." This involves small, everyday habits such as remembering minor details, giving credit freely, responding to everyone respectfully, admitting mistakes, and making time for seemingly "unimportant" conversations. These actions build trust, loyalty, and stronger relationships, demonstrating that likability is a learnable skill rooted in genuine interest and attentiveness towards others.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby team faces a significant challenge for their World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is sidelined with concussion symptoms. Coach John Mitchell must choose between Emma Sing, an inexperienced but promising talent, and Helena Rowland, a more seasoned utility back who previously played full-back in the 2022 World Cup. Experts like Ugo Monye and Katy Daley-McLean favor Rowland for her experience and defensive prowess in knockout rugby. The decision is critical for England's World Cup aspirations.</p>

          <p>Former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has asserted that Angela Rayner's successor must be a woman from outside London to broaden the party's leadership reach. The party's National Executive Committee has initiated a swift deputy leadership race, with nominations opening soon and a winner announced in October. Candidates need significant backing from MPs and either local parties or affiliated groups. Harman expressed disappointment over Rayner's departure but emphasized the need for a complementary figure to galvanize the party.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, economists suggest AI's current impact on the broader labor market remains relatively small, with economic uncertainty being the primary driver of recent job opportunity declines. While some companies, particularly in tech, have announced AI-related layoffs, the technology's influence has largely been concentrated there. Studies indicate early-career workers in highly exposed occupations have seen employment declines, but overall, AI is more likely to augment human labor than fully replace it. Demand for AI skills is growing, encouraging workers to adapt.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his threats to deploy federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Chicago, posting a provocative "Apocalypse Now" parody image. This move, part of a broader strategy targeting Democratic-led cities, aims to expand federal immigration enforcement. Chicago officials and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker oppose a National Guard deployment, fearing erosion of community trust and new protests. The intervention's specifics remain vague, but it poses significant challenges for local police attempting to balance public safety with community relations.</p>

Her outspoken critiques led to legal challenges and made her a polarizing figure, seen as both a hero and a "seditious traitor-writer."

          <p>Taiwan plans to significantly increase its spending in Latin America by over NT$1 billion next year, aiming to strengthen ties with its few remaining diplomatic allies in the region. This move is a direct response to Beijing's intensified efforts to lure these allies away. The budget proposal includes substantial funds for inviting influential figures from Latin America and the Caribbean to Taiwan, nearly doubling the number of guests. Taipei seeks to improve understanding of its policies, promote a positive image, and enhance international visibility amidst fierce diplomatic competition.</p>

          <p>Vince Scidone, a 90-year-old former carpenter and union representative, continues to work part-time at a convenience store in Oklahoma due to rising living costs. Despite a pension that has remained unchanged since 1998, his and his wife's combined monthly expenses now total around $7,000. The couple's savings were depleted by a home down payment and escalating property taxes. Scidone's story highlights the financial pressures faced by many older Americans whose fixed incomes no longer adequately cover modern expenses, forcing them to remain employed well past traditional retirement age.</p>

          <p>Riverwater Partners' Q2 2025 investor letter identifies Abeona Therapeutics Inc. as a compelling investment opportunity in curative gene therapies for rare dermatological diseases. The company's FDA-approved Zevaskyn for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) offers high efficacy with a single-treatment model, differentiating it from competitors. Abeona has adopted an outcomes-based pricing model, supported by regulatory shifts favoring value-based reimbursement frameworks. While recognizing its potential, the investment firm notes that Abeona is not among its top-tier hedge fund holdings, suggesting other AI stocks offer greater upside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of Brian Davies, 68, in a March 2023 house explosion in Swansea has heard testimony from his next-door neighbor, Claire Bennett, who reported smelling gas for weeks prior.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that President Donald Trump's tariff plan will prevail at the Supreme Court, but cautioned that a ruling against it would necessitate massive refunds, potentially totaling $750 billion to $1 trillion. The Trump administration has sought an expedited Supreme Court review after an appeals court deemed most of his "reciprocal tariffs" illegal. Such a refund would represent an unprecedented windfall for businesses that paid the duties. The administration is developing backup plans, including alternative legal authorities for imposing tariffs, should the court's decision go against them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US job market is described as a "late-capitalist nightmare" for millions of job seekers, despite strong corporate profits and low unemployment rates. Hiring has significantly slowed, and the process has become increasingly frustrating due to online platforms and AI-driven screening. Applicants send out thousands of AI-crafted résumés, only to be filtered by algorithms, leading to a "Tinderized" job search where human interaction is rare. This low-hire, low-fire equilibrium is showing cracks, with a likely recession and rising joblessness, particularly for Black workers and young people.</p>
