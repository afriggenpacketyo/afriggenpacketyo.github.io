          <p>NPR is soliciting personal stories and reflections on the meaning of Juneteenth, particularly in light of recent political shifts. Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, has become a national holiday amid broader diversity and inclusion efforts. However, some of these initiatives are being rolled back under the Trump administration, prompting NPR to explore the holiday's significance in the current historical context. The aim is to capture a range of perspectives on how Juneteenth is perceived and celebrated during this period of change and evolving social dynamics. The article invites individuals to share their experiences and thoughts on the holiday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Insurance, led by Commissioner Ricardo Lara, has launched a formal investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires. The investigation was prompted by concerns over inconsistent claim management, frequent adjuster reassignments, and inadequate record-keeping, as well as allegations from wildfire survivor groups. State Farm has stated its cooperation with the investigation, affirming its commitment to assisting customers and meeting contractual obligations while providing necessary information to the department. The inquiry follows a recent approval of a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers after the fires and is expected to take several months to complete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was unlawful. The judge stated the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion, represented racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The lawsuit was filed after the Trump administration slashed billions in NIH funding, citing a desire to shrink the federal government and national debt. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to the organizations and states that filed the lawsuit, but further claims will be ruled on after additional evidence is presented.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with the murder of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted murder of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, also visited the homes of other lawmakers on the night of the shootings, according to the FBI. After the shooting at the Hoffmans' home, Boelter went to a state representative's home in Maple Grove, but that lawmaker was on vacation and not home at the time. Boelter then allegedly moved on to the home of a state senator in New Hope, where a police officer found Boelter's vehicle parked outside the home, but Boelter left before more officers arrived. Investigators allege Boelter stalked his targets and planned his attacks carefully, researching the victims and their families as well as conducting surveillance on them for an extensive period of time.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fiona Havers, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official overseeing COVID-19 hospitalization data, has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to alter the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them. Havers expressed a loss of confidence that the data would be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions. Kennedy bypassed the traditional ACIP process to order changes, firing the current roster of ACIP members and replacing them with individuals who are skeptical of some vaccines. The former ACIP members have denounced Kennedy's actions for dismantling the established vaccine recommendation process.</p>

          <p>Victims of the Los Angeles County fires are suing State Farm, alleging negligence and claiming they were significantly underinsured, leaving them without adequate funds to rebuild their homes. The lawsuit asserts that State Farm misled homeowners by providing replacement cost estimates far below actual rebuilding expenses. This is the second lawsuit filed by L.A. fire victims against insurers for alleged underinsurance, following a similar suit against USAA and AAA. The lawsuit comes as the California Department of Insurance launches an inquiry into State Farm's handling of fire claims after receiving numerous complaints from policyholders.</p>

          <p>A recent public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, triggered by disagreements over a tax and spending bill, may reinforce China's perception of Trump as an unpredictable leader. Musk, formerly a significant political donor and ally of Trump, criticized the president, leading to retaliatory threats from Trump regarding government subsidies and contracts. This fallout could make China more cautious in negotiations with Trump and complicate considerations for a potential summit between the two countries' leaders. Chinese observers believe Trump's behavior aligns with his reputation as a transactional president who uses pressure tactics to maximize his own interests.</p>

          <p>Senator Tim Kaine has introduced a war powers resolution aimed at limiting President Trump's ability to take military action against Iran without congressional authorization. The resolution comes amid escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, raising concerns about potential U.S. involvement in a broader conflict. While the resolution faces challenges in the Republican-controlled Congress, it seeks to compel lawmakers to address the U.S. role in the Middle East and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches regarding war decisions. The resolution would not prevent the U.S. from defending itself against imminent threats but would require congressional approval for offensive action.</p>

          <p>Following the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Joe Morelle are urging Speaker Mike Johnson to increase security measures for House members. They have requested that the Sergeant at Arms take immediate steps to protect House members and that the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) be substantially increased to support additional security measures. Senators are scheduled to receive a security briefing, and House Democrats will participate in a virtual briefing with law enforcement officials. The call for increased security comes amid rising threats against members of Congress and their families.</p>

The Senate version also addresses tax breaks on tipped income and overtime pay, proposing a deduction of up to $25,000.

The SALT deduction cap has been a key issue for lawmakers in high-tax states, but raising the cap is controversial because the benefits would primarily go to higher-income households. Under current law, filers who itemize tax breaks can't claim more than $10,000 for the SALT deduction, including married couples filing jointly.

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his commitment to expanding deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats, stating that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should focus on cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Trump accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state, despite the fact that noncitizens cannot vote in federal or state elections. Trump's comments follow recent protests against his administration's immigration policies and a shift in his stance on undocumented immigrants working in the farming and hospitality industries.</p>
