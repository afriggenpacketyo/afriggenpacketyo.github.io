          <p>Storm Amy has brought significant disruption to Northern Ireland, leading to the early closure of hundreds of schools and the cancellation of various events due to high winds and heavy rain. The Met Office issued amber and yellow weather warnings, with wind gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph in coastal areas. The storm has impacted bus, train, and air travel, with police advising caution on the roads due to hazardous conditions like surface water and the risk of falling trees.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a proposed peace plan for Gaza, warning of severe consequences if the terms are not met. The plan reportedly includes an immediate ceasefire and the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners within 72 hours.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will review a controversial Hawaii law that restricts individuals with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns onto private properties open to the public without the owner's explicit permission. This case is the latest major gun rights dispute to reach the high court following its landmark 2022 decision that expanded Second Amendment rights. The Trump administration has urged the court to take up the case, arguing that the law functions as a near-total ban on carrying firearms in public.</p>

          <p>During his sentencing hearing, Sean 'Diddy' Combs is expected to address the court, following a letter in which he apologized for his actions and claimed to have reformed while incarcerated. Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 11 years, arguing it should reflect his "decades of unchecked violence" and the harm inflicted on his victims. In contrast, Combs' defense team is advocating for a sentence of time served, highlighting his personal contributions and struggles with substance abuse.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding intended for two major Chicago transit system improvement projects, citing the ongoing government shutdown. The Department of Transportation attributed the freeze to a need to review the projects for potentially "unconstitutional practices" related to race or gender in contracting, while blaming Democratic leaders for the shutdown. This action follows similar funding freezes for projects in New York and for climate-related initiatives in states won by the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>

Five years after the birth of their first child, a mother's monthly earnings are, on average, £1,051 lower than they were a year before the birth.

          <p>The collective wealth of the top 1% of Americans reached a record $52 trillion in the second quarter, fueled by a sustained rally in the stock market, according to new Federal Reserve data. The top 10%, who own over 87% of stocks and mutual funds, saw their total net worth climb to $113 trillion. This surge in wealth at the top has widened the gap in the consumer economy, with the affluent now accounting for the largest share of consumer spending since record-keeping began in 1989.

          <p>In the migrant neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico, a unique urban subculture has formed around Colombian cumbia music, led by DJs known as "sonideros." This movement gave birth to the slowed-down "cumbia rebajada" and a distinct local style, though it faced challenges during a period of intense cartel violence that forced parties indoors. After years of fear, cumbia has returned to the streets, with dance groups working to reclaim their cultural identity, keeping the spirit of the music alive in a city that has adopted it as its own.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's first execution in five years has renewed the contentious debate over capital punishment on the island, with activists claiming it was carried out unlawfully while an appeal was pending. The execution of Huang Lin-kai, convicted of a double murder, occurred months after a court ruling narrowed the scope of the death penalty, leading some to believe Taiwan was moving toward abolition. Supporters cite public opinion and justice for victims, while opponents argue it violates human rights and undermines Taiwan's democratic progress.</p>

Solomon anticipates a market reset or check as excitement gives way to a more sober assessment of the technology's actual potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is under intense pressure from industry groups and some celebrity chefs as he considers signing a bill that would ban the sale of cookware containing PFAS, or "forever chemicals." The legislation is part of a broader national movement to eliminate these toxic compounds, which are linked to serious health problems, from consumer products. While public health advocates urge him to sign, the cookware industry is actively lobbying against the ban, arguing it would negatively impact restaurants and consumers.</p>

This development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to formally exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted after coerced confessions.</p>
