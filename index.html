          <p>A trio of cryptocurrency regulation bills has advanced in the House after a record-setting, prolonged vote caused by opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans. Disagreements over last-minute changes and the merging of bills highlighted deep divisions within the party, fueling doubts about the future passage of a comprehensive crypto framework. The struggle occurred despite significant lobbying from the crypto industry and intervention from former President Trump, raising questions about his influence. The legislation's difficult path forward suggests a challenging road ahead for establishing clear crypto rules in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States announced that specific steps have been agreed upon to end severe sectarian violence in southern Syria, which has reportedly killed over 300 people. The agreement follows Israeli airstrikes targeting the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in the Suweida province, where clashes erupted between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes. Israel stated its military intervention was to protect the Druze population, a minority group with ties to those in Israel. The situation remains highly volatile, with reports of a deteriorating humanitarian crisis and acute shortages of essential supplies in the region.</p>

The incident occurred during a children's archery competition when, according to a witness, there was no visible sign of a storm. The victim was identified as 61-year-old Robert Montgomery, a club member who was volunteering to help with the event. This marks the third serious lightning strike incident in the Tri-State Area within the past month, highlighting the unpredictable nature of such weather events.</p>

          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted by over 7% after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i disputed the claims, expressing disappointment over the unilateral withdrawal of a bid it had previously said undervalued the company. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the classification of Seven & i as core to national security made the foreign acquisition highly unlikely to succeed. (not investment advice)</p>

He walked near a minefield and met with children being taught how to avoid the unexploded ordnance, which still poses a daily threat decades after the country's civil war. The visit was in support of the Halo Trust, the same charity Diana famously partnered with for her iconic minefield walk in 1997. The charity has cleared over 120,000 landmines in Angola, but an estimated thousand minefields remain, underscoring the ongoing danger to civilians.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the second straight month in June, falling 0.5% year-over-year and fueling fears of a potential recession. The decline was driven by significant drops in shipments to major partners, with exports to the U.S. falling 11.4% and to China by 4.7%. The downturn is exacerbated by the lack of a trade deal with the United States and the imposition of a 25% tariff on Japanese imports, which has heavily impacted the crucial automobile sector. Analysts warn that these persistent trade headwinds could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deportation data obtained by CBS News indicates that the Trump administration's enforcement push has largely targeted undocumented immigrants without violent criminal records. Of the more than 70,000 convicted criminals deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, while infractions for traffic or immigration offenses were far more common. These figures appear to contrast with the administration's public messaging, which has consistently focused on prioritizing the removal of the "worst of the worst" offenders and those with ties to criminal organizations.

          <h2>Governor Newsom Denounces Trump's Use of National Guard for Immigration Enforcement</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to address immigration, calling it a costly effort to appear "tough" while terrorizing communities. His comments came after the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of half the troops from Los Angeles, a move Newsom attributed to the low utilization rate and absurdity of the deployment. The governor argued that the federal crackdown is harming local businesses and is not focused on violent criminals. Newsom also repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional maps to favor Democrats if Republicans pursue similar efforts in other states.</p>

          <p>Recent federal raids on workplaces have highlighted significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which is designed to confirm employment eligibility. A Nebraska business owner who used the system in good faith saw over 70 of his employees arrested, with officials stating his business was a victim of large-scale identity theft. Experts argue that E-Verify is easy to fool with stolen documents, as it vets paperwork rather than people, creating a "wink-and-nod" system. This vulnerability not only exposes employers to raids but also fuels identity theft, leaving both businesses and identity theft victims vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to provide a critical safety net for veterans at risk of foreclosure, following a series of missteps by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation will allow veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgages to move missed payments to the end of their loan term, a standard option available to most other homeowners. This solution was urgently needed after the VA abruptly ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving thousands of veterans with unaffordable options to save their homes. The bill's passage is a rare instance of bipartisan cooperation to correct the issue.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a key FEMA program that funds pre-disaster mitigation projects. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision that rests with Congress. The states claim the cuts jeopardize hundreds of critical infrastructure projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters like floods and storms. A recent analysis showed that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

Program directors fear that funding cuts could force them to shut down, leaving thousands of isolated seniors without critical social connections.

The former inspector general for USAID, along with other officials, states the administration has provided little evidence to support these claims, suggesting the cuts are politically motivated. Sources allege that program terminations were based on keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than on effectiveness reviews. This has raised concerns in Congress about a lack of transparency as a deadline for a Senate vote on the cuts approaches.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has now reached £1,076 per child, according to new research from the charity Coram. Prices have risen significantly in some regions, with high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs cited as key drivers. The rising expense places a heavy financial burden on working parents, who often have no alternative for childcare during the long school break. For families on Universal Credit, the system of paying childcare costs in arrears makes it difficult to afford the large upfront payments required by most clubs.</p>

Lawyers claim that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurers for arranging building policies, then passed the inflated costs on to leaseholders without their knowledge. As insurance premiums have soared since the Grenfell Tower fire, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly allowing freeholders to profit from the disaster.
