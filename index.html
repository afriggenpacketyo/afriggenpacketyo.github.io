        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Southwest Airlines dropped over 11% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations and significantly cut its full-year profit forecast. CEO Bob Jordan noted that while travel demand is stabilizing, factors like summer discounting and the underperformance of new basic economy fares have impacted revenue. The airline is undergoing a business model overhaul, including plans to introduce assigned seating, and has announced a new $2 billion share buyback program amidst the financial turbulence.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly appealed to resident doctors to call off their impending five-day strike, warning of significant harm to the National Health Service. The British Medical Association (BMA) is demanding pay restoration to 2008 levels, citing a 20% real-terms pay cut despite recent raises. While the government states it cannot afford further pay increases, it has offered to negotiate on working conditions and career progression. The strike follows the breakdown of talks and is expected to cause major disruptions, with over a million treatments already cancelled from previous actions.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced an 8% decline after the company reported its second consecutive quarter of falling auto sales and a 12% drop in total revenue. CEO Elon Musk warned of potential "rough quarters" ahead, citing the expiration of federal EV tax credits and increasing competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers. The company's performance has been the weakest among tech megacaps this year, and while a more affordable model is in limited production, Tesla refrained from providing official delivery guidance for the remainder of the year.

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. The meeting, directed by Attorney General Pam Bondi, is part of the Justice Department's renewed efforts to gather more information about the Epstein case. This action comes amid mounting political pressure on the Trump administration to provide greater transparency, particularly after a DOJ memo concluded there was no "client list" and confirmed Epstein's death as a suicide, a finding that has been met with skepticism.</p>

The remarks were made as the House Oversight Committee voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its records, highlighting increasing pressure from both parties to release more information about the disgraced financier and his associates.</p>

          <p>Honeywell's stock fell 5% despite the company reporting second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for revenue, organic sales, and earnings per share. The industrial conglomerate also raised its full-year guidance for these key metrics. The negative market reaction was likely driven by a miss on segment margin for the quarter and a lowered margin outlook for the year, attributed partly to increased R&D spending. The company is proceeding with its plan to split into three separate public companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group in Congress is advocating for the release of a wider range of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein than the Trump administration has sought. While the White House has only requested the unsealing of grand jury transcripts, legislation like the Epstein Files Transparency Act calls for all investigative files, flight logs, and travel records. This has created a difficult situation for Republican leadership, who are caught between their base's demand for transparency and the administration's apparent desire to limit the disclosures and move on from the issue.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cyclical nature of facial hair trends, from its widespread acceptance among 19th-century U.S. presidents to its decline in the clean-shaven 20th century. Facial hair has signified various things over time, including criminality, counter-cultural rebellion, and, more recently, the quirky aesthetic of the hipster era. Today, beards and mustaches are once again common, adopted by figures from politicians seeking a more relatable image to young men embracing a retro style, demonstrating that what grows on a man's face remains a potent form of self-expression.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in New York have temporarily closed the Goodman Mountain trail in the Adirondacks because a large bull moose has been lingering near the summit for weeks. The animal's refusal to move is considered highly unusual, as moose typically inhabit lower, aquatic-rich elevations during the summer. While the 900-pound moose has not been aggressive, officials suspect an underlying illness may be influencing its behavior. The trail remains closed for public safety as researchers continue to monitor the animal's condition via trail cameras.</p>

          <p>This analysis posits that a core obstacle to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the maximalist desire within both societies to control all the land and have the other side disappear. The article argues that past U.S. policy, by insisting on a two-state solution, constrained these impulses, but the Trump administration's approach has dangerously reinforced them. Specifically, President Trump's proposal to turn Gaza into a "Riviera" was interpreted by the Israeli far-right as a green light for ethnic cleansing, prolonging the war and undermining any potential for a lasting resolution.</p>
