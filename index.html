          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged to a new record, exceeding $122,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by increasing institutional investment and anticipation of clearer U.S. cryptocurrency regulations, with several crypto-related bills currently under deliberation in Congress. Analysts suggest that growing confidence from long-term institutional buyers and potential policy clarity are key factors propelling the price upward. However, risks remain, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's potential for further interest rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London is facing questions about its economic vitality as it experiences an exodus of millionaires, businesses seeking to list abroad, and workers struggling with high living costs. Some market strategists argue the city's appeal has diminished due to over-regulation and political instability, leading to a decline in its status as a premier financial hub. However, other economists remain optimistic, highlighting London's strong fundamentals like the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a growing business services sector. They suggest that while competition from other global cities has intensified, targeted adjustments can ensure London's continued success.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed U.S. fears that the company's advanced chips could be utilized by China's military, stating that Beijing already has sufficient computing capacity and cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, arguing they are counterproductive to maintaining American tech leadership, as they limit access to the large market of AI developers in China. His comments come as he navigates the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing, attempting to preserve market access while complying with U.S. regulations.</p>

          <p>A rapidly expanding wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures, including visitor facilities and employee housing. The Dragon Bravo Fire grew to 5,000 acres, fueled by strong winds, and also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that temporarily halted firefighting efforts. No injuries have been reported, but the event marks a significant loss of historical architecture. Meanwhile, smoke from Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is undertaking a massive preservation effort to save about 100,000 books from a severe beetle infestation. Restoration workers are removing the volumes to treat them in a nitrogen-filled, oxygen-free environment for six weeks to eradicate the pests, which feed on the gelatin and starch-based adhesives in the bookbindings. Library officials believe rising temperatures due to climate change may have exacerbated the infestation by allowing the beetles more life cycles annually. The project aims to protect centuries of irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, capturing approximately 10% of the market in what is considered Europe's most EV-friendly country. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG are competing effectively with established players like Tesla, benefiting from competitive pricing, advanced technology, and Norway's policy of not imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs. Analysts view Norway as a key entry point for these brands into the broader European market due to its high EV adoption rate and lack of a domestic auto industry.

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has revealed questionable sales tactics at Connells and Purplebricks, two of the U.K.'s largest estate agencies. An undercover reporter at Connells found evidence of the branch manager favoring buyers who used the company's in-house mortgage services, potentially costing sellers a higher sale price. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that properties were deliberately overvalued to secure listings, with staff later incentivized to persuade sellers to reduce the price. The findings raise serious concerns about conflicts of interest and whether agents are acting in their clients' best interests.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating resilience in its trade sector. The growth was largely driven by a surge in shipments to Southeast Asian and European Union countries, which helped offset a continued, though moderated, decline in exports to the United States. A temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China contributed to easing the drop in U.S.-bound trade.

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of slowing. In a recent interview, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This potential monetary easing comes as the UK economy shows signs of sluggishness, which could help bring down inflation. The Bank's next decision on the current 4.25% interest rate is scheduled for August 7. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian attacks. Trump emphasized that the delivery would be structured as a sale, stating that European Union and NATO allies would fully reimburse the U.S. for the cost of the sophisticated military equipment. The announcement marks a significant development in U.S. policy toward the conflict, coming after the administration had previously paused some arms shipments.

          <p>President Trump is urging Republican senators to support a bill that includes significant funding cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes federal money to outlets like NPR and PBS. While the president has criticized these outlets for alleged bias, a substantial portion of the federal funding supports local media stations in rural areas. Some Republican senators from rural states, like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed opposition to the cuts, warning that many small, local stations rely on this funding to operate and provide essential, life-saving information in news deserts.</p>

          <p>In response to a sharp increase in immigration raids in Los Angeles, volunteer groups like Union del Barrio are organizing to support undocumented communities.

The intensified enforcement, which has seen nearly 2,800 arrests in the city since June, is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on illegal immigration.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in France's defense budget, warning that Europe's liberty faces its greatest threat since World War II. Citing a "pivotal moment" in geopolitics and denouncing "imperialist policies," Macron proposed doubling the country's military budget by 2027, three years ahead of the original schedule. The plan, which still requires government approval, would raise annual defense spending to €64 billion. The move aligns with a broader push among NATO allies to bolster their military capabilities in response to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
