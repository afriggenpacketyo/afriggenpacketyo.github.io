          <p>McDonald's reported a 3.6% drop in U.S. same-store sales, marking the largest domestic decline since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, which analysts attribute to bad weather and cautious consumer spending, while the company also reported a 1% drop in same-store sales across all markets. Despite the disappointing figures, McDonald's reiterated its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations and invest $3 billion to $3.2 billion in capital expenditures. The company plans to introduce value meals and popular menu items to attract customers back to its restaurants, like the return of snack wraps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement granting Washington access to Ukraine's natural resources through an investment fund, setting up a partnership aimed at bolstering Ukraine's economy amid its conflict with Russia. The deal, which does not require Ukraine to repay any supposed debt, includes provisions for oil and gas projects alongside mineral extraction, with profits reinvested in Ukraine for the first decade. While the agreement acknowledges Ukraine's aspirations to join the European Union, it notably lacks a security guarantee, though the US frames the deal as essential for continued military assistance to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and revenue, raising its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $6 to $6.20 per share, citing improvements in its insurance business, though they revised their GAAP diluted EPS guidance to be lower, including charges related to a legal battle. The company's insurer, Aetna, showed signs of recovery with a decreased medical benefit ratio, and CEO David Joyner expressed caution about potential impacts from President Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Joyner noted that the company is planning for elevated trends in medical costs, and most of the company's retail products are sourced in the U.S., which should be a benefit.</p>

          <p>General Motors has lowered its 2025 financial guidance, citing potential tariff exposure of up to $5 billion, with the company now projecting adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $10 billion and $12.5 billion. Despite the reduced outlook, GM CEO Mary Barra stated the company is adapting to the new trade policy environment and working to strengthen its supply base, with a 27% increase in U.S. sourced parts. GM plans to utilize its existing U.S. assembly plants to efficiently add capacity and offset increased costs from tariffs, though Barra declined to comment on shifting production from Mexico to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Meta has cautioned that European users may experience a "materially worse" experience following a regulatory decision by the European Commission regarding its "consent or pay" model, which was fined €200m (£171m) for not complying with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The company anticipates that modifications to its model could significantly impact its European business and revenue, potentially starting in the third quarter of this year, while Meta is in discussions with the UK's data watchdog about a similar model for UK users. Analyst Eric Seufert suggests Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into "vocal cheerleaders" amid the regulatory clampdown.</p>

          <p>With parts of the UK expected to reach 29C, experts say the spring heatwave will undoubtedly have an effect on plants, with indoor plants needing protection and trees potentially suffering, while outdoor plants may thrive if watered properly. Indoor plants can scorch in bright sunlight, and conservatories can get too hot unless shading is provided, while fruits and veggies are ripening at a phenomenal rate, with strawberry farmers reporting a significant increase in harvest. Newly sown seeds and recently planted vegetables, flowers, and shrubs will need careful watering until they grow their roots out enough, and trees are entering their leaf expansion phase, which demands substantial physiological resources, including water.</p>

          <p>President Trump acknowledged that his tariffs could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States, suggesting that American children might have two dolls instead of 30, but he insisted China would suffer more from his trade war. Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any setbacks after a government report showed the US economy shrank during the first three months of the year, while Democrats claim that Trump's policies could shove the economy into a recession. Senator Jeff Merkley stated costs, chaos, and corruption are already on the rise under Trump, with the economy slowing and middle-class families feeling the pinch.</p>

          <p>A Vox article explores whether pronatalist policies, aimed at boosting birth rates, benefit children, examining policies like giving money to parents and the broader societal impact of having more children. Experts suggest that policies providing financial support to families, such as expanded child tax credits, could directly benefit children by improving financial stability, but other measures like medals for large families are unlikely to have a significant impact. The article also considers whether a world with more children leads to greater tolerance and child-friendly environments, but notes that pronatalism can be associated with patriarchal values, potentially disadvantaging girls, and that fewer children can mean more resources per child.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda stated the central bank remains on track to pursue additional interest rate hikes despite economic uncertainty from U.S. tariffs prompting it to lower its growth and inflation outlooks. The BOJ revised down the forecasts as it factored in tariff levels imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump that "cannot be ignored," even though Tokyo has been urging Washington to rethink the policy. The BOJ maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent for the second consecutive meeting, with economists saying the central bank seeks to raise the policy rate to curb demand-driven inflation.</p>

          <p>Howmet Aerospace has raised its 2025 profit forecast due to robust demand for its aircraft parts, projecting adjusted profit per share between $3.36 and $3.44, up from the previous forecast of $3.13 to $3.21, despite warning customers of potential shipment halts due to tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The company is prioritizing long-term deals after a strong 2024, as it sees fresh demand from customers after a major fire earlier this year at its peer SPS Technologies' parts factory hit supply.

          <p>A 10-foot great white shark stranded in shallow water off the Australian coast was rescued by three local men, aided by an 11-year-old boy and his father, who waded into the ocean to help return the distressed animal to deeper water. The rescuers used crab rakes to move the shark, believed to be sick or tired, and wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta noted that shark strandings are becoming more visible through social media. While shark attacks in Australia are rare, authorities emphasize human safety first and recommend contacting environmental authorities if such incidents occur.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the partnership would allow the two countries to invest together to accelerate Ukraine's economic recovery and help to "facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signaled that the outline of a deal had already been agreed in mid-April, with Ukraine determining where and what to extract.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented assault upon the environment, instigating 145 actions to undo rules protecting clean air, water and a livable climate in this administration’s first 100 days – more rollbacks than were completed in Trump’s entire first term as US president. Through executive orders, agency memos and other policy moves, the Trump administration has deleted a swath of Joe Biden-era green policies, frozen climate spending, removed the US from the Paris climate accords and set about rewriting pollution standards for cars, trucks and power plants. Sprawling tracts of land, including in the Arctic, have been earmarked for new oil and gas drilling, and commercial fishing will be ushered into ocean sanctuaries.</p>

          <p>Some private companies said they want to pick up strands of research that might have otherwise been funded by the federal government, as the federal government has slashed research since Donald Trump took office. The effort has stoked little optimism among experts, who caution that private efforts cannot remotely replicate the breadth, depth or public service provided by federal funding. Health policy insiders said the many small projects that hope to keep research alive cannot remotely match the retreat of federal government research, while the federal government’s backing of scientific research has been fundamental to modern drug discovery.</p>
