        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused them of civil extortion and defamation following Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation complaint, which Baldoni denies. A similar lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, stating the lawsuit was a sham, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately comment; however, Baldoni and his production company Wayfarer Studios have the option to amend some claims by June 23. This legal battle stemmed from accusations and counter-accusations between the parties involved, leading to a high-profile court case in the entertainment industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This comment came before Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying National Guard troops to address protests against these enforcement actions. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's federalization of the California National Guard, arguing it was an unprecedented move without the governor's request. Newsom responded sharply, accusing Trump of authoritarianism, while federal prosecutors charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy related to impeding an officer during a protest. The situation underscores escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policies and enforcement.</p>

          <p>A Boston judge, Shelley M. Richmond Joseph, is facing a misconduct hearing for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE in 2018. The judge is accused of assisting Jose Medina-Perez, a twice-deported Dominican national, to leave the courthouse undetected while an ICE agent was waiting to take him into custody. Joseph's counsel emphasized that she has not been convicted of any crime, while prosecutors allege she instructed a court clerk to mislead the ICE agent and ordered the courtroom audio recorder to be turned off. The Justice Department dropped criminal charges against Joseph after she admitted to certain facts related to the case, and the Massachusetts Commission on Judicial Conduct subsequently filed formal charges against her.</p>

Rudd, who became the youngest girl charged with terrorism offenses in the UK after downloading a bomb-making manual, took her own life in May 2022 after the charges were dropped.

          <p>California officials announced they would file a federal lawsuit against President Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, challenging the deployment of nearly 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles. The lawsuit alleges that the deployment, made over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, violates the U.S. Constitution and oversteps federal authority. Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the move infringes on state sovereignty and was designed to inflame the situation. The lawsuit follows days of protests and clashes after ICE raids, with local officials defending the right to peaceful demonstration.</p>

          <p>Canada will meet NATO's defense spending target of 2% of gross domestic product this fiscal year, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced. This achievement is five years ahead of the Liberal party's previous plan, driven by concerns over a "darker" global landscape and the need to reduce security dependence on the United States. The increased spending will fund new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles, artillery, radar, drones, and sensors, along with increased pay for the armed forces.
