          <p>The United States launched "Operation Midnight Hammer," a top-secret precision attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, marking the largest strike using B2 bombers in history. The mission involved the first use of Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs (MOP) on the Natanz and Fordo sites, with over 125 aircraft participating. According to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been "obliterated" as a result of the operation. President Trump addressed the nation, stating that the strikes were a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, though an assessment is still underway to determine the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that recent actions against Iran, including U.S. military strikes, enhance U.S. national security by weakening Iranian-supported terrorist groups. The article asserts that Iran is the worldâ€™s largest state sponsor of terrorism, funding groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, all of whom pose a direct threat to Americans. It cites examples of these groups' violent actions and anti-American sentiments, emphasizing the need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons to protect both Israel and the United States. The author contends that a weakened or fallen Iranian regime would prevent its proxies from acquiring destructive power and threatening American lives.</p>

The law, which goes into effect on September 1, prohibits individuals, companies, and government entities from these countries from purchasing property, with exceptions for U.S. green card holders and citizens. Those holding valid U.S. visas can purchase property, but only if it is used as a primary residence, preventing nationals from the specified countries from buying investment properties.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" following recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Hegseth clarified that the operation was not aimed at regime change in Iran, echoing remarks made by President Trump about the "destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity," but the full extent of the damage remained unclear.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is expected to post record-low results in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, regarded as a bellwether for the July House of Councillors race, as he struggles to steer a minority government in national politics. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to become the biggest force in the 127-member assembly, underscoring the appeal of her policies centered on quality of life. Tomin translates to Tokyoites. This year brings a rare overlap between the Tokyo assembly race, held every four years, and the upper house election, which takes place every three years -- a once-in-12-years occurrence. Ishiba has opted not to dissolve the House of Representatives for an early snap election.</p>

          <p>BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner analyzes potential strategic courses of action available to Iran following the U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear sites. These options include retaliating hard and soon, retaliating later at a time of Iran's choosing, or choosing not to retaliate. The analysis considers the risks and benefits of each option, including potential targets for retaliation, such as US bases in the Middle East, and the possibility of economic disruptions. The decision-making process will likely prioritize the survival of the Islamic Republic regime.</p>

It contrasts this action with George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, which was authorized by Congress, allowing for public debate and accountability. The author contends that bypassing Congress deprives citizens of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The trend of unilateral actions by presidents is seen as dangerous and potentially radicalizing, limiting avenues for citizens to voice their opposition to war.</p>
