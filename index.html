          <p>A UN General Assembly summit is set to discuss the two-state solution, with several Western nations like France and the UK expected to soon join over 145 countries in recognizing Palestine as a state. This diplomatic effort follows a deadly Israeli military campaign in Gaza and a UN report concluding Israel is committing genocide, a claim Israel and the U.S. reject. While proponents see recognition as a symbolic affirmation of Palestinian rights that strengthens their negotiating position, critics, including some Palestinian supporters, argue it may be a hollow gesture without concrete actions like sanctions against Israel to enforce it.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to take action against Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Davey alleges that "crimes" are being committed on the platform, citing the presence of illegal and harmful content such as child abuse imagery and self-harm material, claiming Musk has dismantled the platform's child safety team. The call for an investigation comes as Davey accuses Musk of inciting violence and meddling in British democracy, highlighting a growing conflict over the enforcement of the UK's new Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians express a mix of hope and resignation as countries like the UK and France move to recognize a Palestinian state. Residents describe a reality of increasing Israeli military control and settlement expansion, which undermines the authority of the Palestinian Authority and the prospects of a viable state. Despite fears that recognition could provoke Israel to formally annex more territory, many, including local officials, see it as a crucial step to affirm their rights on the international stage and shape a more secure future for their people.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found that the Moon is more geologically active than previously thought, identifying 41 new landslides that have occurred since 2009. By comparing high-resolution images taken over time, the researchers linked these landslides to moonquakes, challenging the long-held belief that the Moon's internal activity had mostly ceased. The findings, published in the National Science Review, have significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, highlighting potential geological hazards that must be considered for long-term infrastructure and safety.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act" into law, which prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. The legislation, which also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, is a direct response to federal immigration enforcement operations directed by the Trump administration. Newsom and other state officials characterized the law as a pushback against authoritarian tactics, while a U.S. Attorney stated the law has no jurisdiction over federal agents, who will continue to protect their identities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have observed an alarming trend of great white sharks moving further north into the waters of New Hampshire, Maine, and Canada, a shift likely driven by increasing seal populations and rising ocean temperatures. This migration poses new risks to public safety in areas where beachgoers are not accustomed to the presence of these predators, tragically highlighted by Maine's first recorded fatal shark attack in 2020. Conservation groups and government agencies are responding by enhancing shark tracking and public awareness initiatives, such as the Sharktivity app, to mitigate potential human-shark encounters.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point has had a counterintuitive effect on the bond market. While the move initially sent stocks to record highs, yields on long-term bonds, which influence mortgage and other loan rates, actually increased. Analysts suggest bond traders are concerned that the Fed is easing its monetary policy too soon, potentially allowing inflation to remain elevated, which devalues long-term securities. This market reaction indicates skepticism about the central bank's timing and could signal continued pressure on borrowing costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House has since called the investigation "blatantly political."</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was recently killed, rose to prominence as a leading voice for young supporters of Donald Trump. He co-founded Turning Point USA at age 18, building a massive social media following by engaging in combative debates on college campuses, which he framed as piercing the "liberal echo chamber." Kirk used his platform to champion a right-wing Christian worldview and defend populist stances on immigration, diversity, and other cultural issues, earning both a loyal army of followers and accusations of racism. His close relationship with President Trump cemented his status as a key figure in the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station. The incident, in which at least three bullets were fired into the building's lobby on a Friday afternoon, resulted in no injuries, though the building was occupied at the time. The shooting occurred one day after a protest was held outside the station regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, but a motive has not yet been established. The suspect was charged with multiple felonies, including shooting into an occupied building, and has since been released on bail.</p>

          <h2>Flash Flooding Threat Could Return in the West as Gabrielle Strengthens in the Atlantic</h2>

          <p>Deadly flooding that impacted parts of the Southwest U.S. over the last couple of days continued easing with no flood alerts in effect for the area as of Saturday evening. However, with more monsoonal moisture on the way, the risk for flash flooding will increase for parts of the region on Sunday and Monday. Another area of low pressure will bring more moisture into southern parts of California and Arizona on Sunday, elevating the threat for flash flooding. Even though the threat level is only marginal (a level 1 out of 4), isolated thunderstorms and periods of heavier rainfall could lead to some localized flooding in prone spots. Over the last couple of days, heavy rain and flash flooding drenched the Southwest and even became deadly in one instance. In Barstow, California, a 2-year-old was swept away after their family's car was swept off a road and overtaken by floodwaters. After a 20-hour search, officials said the boy's body was recovered. Flash flooding occurred in other parts of the Southwest as the heaviest downpours dropped 1 to 2 inches of rain in around an hour for some spots, causing some roads to be washed out and anything in the way of rushing floodwaters to be swept away. Looking ahead, the threat for flash flooding in the Southwest will shift farther east on Monday, covering a good portion of Arizona and western New Mexico, as shower activity increases over the region. Likewise, localized flash flooding can’t be ruled out, especially in flood-prone areas. Any burn scar areas will be especially prone to dangerous flash flooding which could trigger debris flows and mudslides. Burned soil lowers the threshold for flash flooding, meaning even lower rainfall totals can lead to significant flash flooding and other impacts, which unfold quickly. Meanwhile, the threat for flash flooding will also expand across the Central U.S. Monday into Tuesday, stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma all the way to Ohio. Widespread, scattered showers and thunderstorms firing up and pushing through the Plains and Midwest could bring locally heavy downpours to parts of the region, which could in turn lead to flooding. Tropical Storm Gabrielle Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to churn in the central Atlantic and will continue to strengthen. The storm is expected to become a hurricane either later Saturday night or Sunday. If it does become a hurricane, Gabrielle would become the 2nd hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. On average, the 2nd hurricane forms around August 26, making this hurricane almost a month later than normally expected. As of Saturday evening, Gabrielle was located about 580 miles southeast of Bermuda. The center of the storm is expected to pass east of Bermuda early next week before taking on a more eastward trajectory across the north-central Atlantic by the midweek. At the very least, Gabrielle will impact Bermuda with dangerous surf, large swells and life-threatening rip currents as it passes east. However, the storm’s outer bands could still clip the island Sunday night into Monday, bringing rainfall and wind impacts as well. Even though Gabrielle will not have any direct impacts to the U.S. mainland, it will still generate rough surf and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast, from North Carolina up through Maine later this weekend into next week. The National Hurricane Center is also watching a weak tropical wave located off the west coast of Africa as it produces some disorganized thunderstorms. It has a 20% chance of development in the next seven days as it slowly treks across the central Atlantic. While it could take a similar track as Gabrielle, further details regarding its development and path remain uncertain at this time. Until then, this disturbance will continued to be monitored closely. Tropical activity in the Atlantic is forecasted to slowly ramp back up over the next few weeks as conditions gradually become more favorable for development. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through Nov. 30.</p>

          <h2>Flash Flood Threat Persists in U.S. Southwest as Tropical Storm Gabrielle Strengthens</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While deadly flash flooding in the U.S. Southwest has recently eased, forecasters warn that another surge of monsoonal moisture will increase the risk again for parts of California and Arizona. The region remains vulnerable, especially in burn scar areas, following recent floods that led to at least one fatality. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is expected to become a hurricane, though it is not projected to make landfall in the U.S. It will, however, generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>
