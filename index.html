            <p>U.S. stock markets experienced slight declines after China announced new tariffs on American goods in response to increased U.S. tariffs, escalating the trade war between the two economic superpowers. China's tariffs increased to 125%, but Beijing said it would not increase levies further. The move comes in response to a 145% tariff on Chinese goods announced by President Donald Trump earlier this week. Asian and European markets also reacted negatively to the news, reflecting global uncertainty about the trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari indicated that rising bond yields and a weakening dollar suggest investors are re-evaluating the U.S. as the safest investment haven. Kashkari noted that normally tariff increases would strengthen the dollar, but its decline suggests a shift in investor preferences. This comes as the 10-year Treasury yield surged following President Trump's tariff announcements, and the dollar has slumped against other currencies. Kashkari emphasized the importance of keeping inflation expectations stable amidst fiscal and trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article explains what tariffs are, how they function, and why President Trump is employing them in trade disputes. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, and Trump argues they will boost U.S. manufacturing and protect jobs. Recent announcements include tariffs on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, with retaliatory measures from other countries. Economists expect tariffs to increase prices for consumers and cause volatility in stock markets, affecting pensions and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

Bartering can be a viable option for getting needs met while building relationships and community ties, but income from bartering may be taxable.</p>

            <p>A new study suggests that Los Angeles' 'mansion tax,' intended to fund affordable housing, is likely contributing to a decline in overall apartment construction. The tax, which applies to property sales over $5 million, has made it more difficult to profit on new housing developments, leading to fewer land sales. Researchers estimate a reduction of at least 1,910 units per year. Supporters of the tax argue that other factors, such as rising interest rates, are primarily responsible for the decline.</p>
