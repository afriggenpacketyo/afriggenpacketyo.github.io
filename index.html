          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 04:04:06 EDT</div>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has proposed creating an international center to coordinate global AI governance, aiming to counter what he described as a "fragmented trend." Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li emphasized the need for a widely accepted framework to align differing national regulations and institutional approaches. This initiative is seen as an effort by China to increase its influence in the rapidly advancing AI sector, particularly as it faces intense technological competition with the United States, which recently announced its own AI development blueprint.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travel and hygiene experts are warning guests about several overlooked, germ-infested spots commonly found in hotel rooms. Studies and insider accounts indicate that decorative items like pillows and bed runners are rarely washed, and high-touch surfaces such as remotes and light switches harbor significant bacteria. Other problem areas include bathtubs, which can be dirtier than toilets, and reusable items like glassware and ice buckets that may not be properly cleaned between stays. To mitigate risks, experts recommend wiping down surfaces upon arrival and thoroughly rinsing any provided drinkware before use.</p>

          <p>China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, has published a series of commentaries urging the army's political officers to improve their public image. The guidelines emphasize demonstrating loyalty to the Communist Party leadership, maintaining honesty, and ensuring integrity in soldier promotions. Observers suggest these directives are a response to recent corruption scandals involving high-ranking generals and reflect Beijing's effort to repair the reputation of its political cadres. The articles stress that loyalty is paramount to prevent personal interests from undermining the collective good and party principles.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland to negotiate a framework trade agreement. The meeting aims to avert a potential trade war, as the U.S. has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on EU goods starting August 1. There is growing optimism for a deal, with sources suggesting a potential agreement could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent U.S. deal with Japan. This high-stakes discussion highlights the critical nature of the transatlantic trade relationship, which accounts for a significant portion of global GDP.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) lost 1-0 to the Portland Timbers at BMO Stadium, marking a disappointing result just before their Leagues Cup debut. A 45th-minute header from Christian Paredes secured the victory for Portland, whose goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau kept his former team from scoring. The loss leaves LAFC in sixth place in the Western Conference, having now dropped points in consecutive home games. Coach Steve Cherundolo expressed frustration over conceding on a set piece and highlighted the team's need to be active in the transfer market to bring new energy to the squad.</p>

          <p>The ongoing border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia involves two militaries with vastly different capabilities and international backing. Thailand, a long-standing U.S. treaty ally, possesses a significantly larger, better-funded, and more technologically advanced military, including a superior air force. In contrast, Cambodia's younger armed forces rely heavily on support from China, which has become a key supplier of defense equipment and has helped develop a naval base. While Thailand holds a clear military advantage, analysts note that the terrain along the disputed border may favor Cambodian forces, potentially leading Thailand to rely on air power.</p>

The lawsuit, filed in February, accused the jurisdictions of thwarting federal immigration law by limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the local policies do not illegally interfere with federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. The ruling notes that the policies still allow for cooperation if federal agents present a criminal warrant, thereby upholding a degree of local autonomy.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been questioned by the U.S. Justice Department. The questioning, which lasted for a day and a half, covered a wide range of topics and individuals, according to her lawyer. This development has renewed focus on President Trump's past association with Epstein, though Trump has denied any wrongdoing and stated he was never briefed on his name appearing in Epstein's files. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed no offer of clemency was made for her cooperation and that she still plans to appeal her conviction.</p>

          <p>A shooting inside a dormitory at the University of New Mexico resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and left a 19-year-old hospitalized with injuries. The incident occurred early Friday morning when four people were playing video games in a dorm room, leading to the arrest of an 18-year-old suspect. According to state police, the suspect began shooting at the other occupants for reasons that are still under investigation. The university closed its central campus for the day as a precaution but has since announced it will reopen, offering counseling services to the community.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunis to denounce what they call President Kais Saied's authoritarian regime, four years after he dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree. Chanting for the "fall of the regime," demonstrators criticized the government for mass arrests of opposition leaders, journalists, and activists, which they say has turned the country into an "open-air prison." The protest marks a significant shift for a day once celebrated as Tunisia's Republic Day, now associated by critics with a slide into authoritarianism and the dismantling of democratic institutions established after the Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing over 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a government-wide deferred resignation program. This initiative, introduced by the Trump administration to reduce the size and cost of the federal workforce, could shrink NASA's civil servant personnel from 18,000 to 14,000. The potential exodus comes as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis. NASA has stated that safety remains a top priority as it works to become a more streamlined organization.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in 5-2 Victory Over Red Sox</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Boston Red Sox 5-2, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a slump earlier in the month, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor with a run-scoring walk and a two-run homer, continuing his recent return to form. The improved hitting provided enough support for pitcher Emmet Sheehan and the bullpen, which recorded its first scoreless effort in weeks, securing a positive start to the team's road trip ahead of the trade deadline.</p>
