          <p>Microsoft is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" after more than four decades, replacing it with a black background and a simplified message. The change, part of a broader effort to improve Windows' resilience, was announced following the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage that affected millions of systems. The new error screen, which will roll out on Windows 11 this summer, removes the sad face icon and displays a more condensed text to streamline the user experience during unexpected system restarts and help users recover more quickly from disruptions.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a significant 9.1% drop in May compared to the previous year, marking the sharpest decline since October 2024. This downturn indicates that Beijing's economic stimulus measures may not be effectively boosting corporate profitability. Despite this, some financial institutions have upgraded China's overall 2025 growth forecast, citing resilient exports to regions like Southeast Asia and the European Union, which have helped offset a plunge in shipments to the United States amid ongoing trade tensions.

          <p>Nike announced that new U.S. tariffs will add approximately $1 billion in costs during the current fiscal year, a significant headwind as the company navigates a major turnaround plan. Despite beating fourth-quarter estimates, the sneaker giant's profits fell 86% as it cleared out old inventory and shifted its sales strategy back toward wholesale partners. The company plans to mitigate the tariff impact by adjusting its supply chain, reducing its manufacturing presence in China, and implementing price increases, while confirming the recent quarter represented the financial low point of its restructuring.

In other team news, guard Austin Reaves has reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension.

However, the bill faces significant opposition from Democrats, who criticize its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The potential for a logjam in the Senate now threatens the bill's passage, forcing the administration to soften its timeline.</p>

          <p>A pilot project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is demonstrating innovative ways to combat the urban heat island effect, where dense city areas become significantly hotter than greener suburbs. An environmental group called GreenRoots has transformed a single "cool block" by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This urban laboratory aims to create a template for other cities struggling with rising temperatures due to climate change. Researchers are studying the project's effectiveness, as such interventions can reduce peak temperatures and improve public health.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the 90-day pause on his "reciprocal tariffs," which is set to expire on July 9. A spokeswoman stated the deadline is "not critical," suggesting that negotiations with key trading partners, including Japan, could continue. This provides a potential reprieve for countries facing steep, country-specific tariffs on top of the baseline 10% duty on imports. The statement came as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks aimed at securing concessions from the U.S. administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its first major move, the CDC's new vaccine advisory committee, appointed by HHS Secretary Robert F.

The panel also endorsed a new RSV shot for newborns, adding another option for parents, though some new members expressed reservations.

Republicans, however, defended the administration's characterization, stating the sites were effectively destroyed.
