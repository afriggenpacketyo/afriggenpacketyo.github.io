          <p>Cindy McCain, the executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, stated that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is drastically insufficient to address the looming famine caused by Israel's blockade. McCain emphasized that 500,000 Gazans are severely food insecure and on the brink of famine, requiring aid at scale, not just a "dribble" of trucks. She refuted claims that Hamas is looting aid trucks, attributing it to the desperation of starving people, and urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow more aid into Gaza to prevent further catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old U.S.-German citizen, Joseph Neumayer, was arrested at JFK Airport after being deported from Israel for allegedly attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.

Social media posts attributed to Neumayer included threats against America, Americans, and former President Trump.

          <p>A law professor argues that the Supreme Court is increasingly enabling President Trump to consolidate power within the executive branch. The author criticizes the court's recent order that effectively allows the president to fire high-level officials who are typically protected by law. This decision undermines lower courts seeking to uphold the rule of law and emboldens the administration to act outside of traditional constitutional order. The author warns that the court's actions risk assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law.</p>

          <p>Despite the completion of a large prisoner exchange, Russia launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles on cities across Ukraine, resulting in at least 18 deaths and 85 injuries, including children. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched 367 "air attack vehicles," but Ukrainian air defenses neutralized many of the incoming projectiles. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex, while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as deliberate attacks on ordinary cities and called for increased international pressure on Russia.

He stated that the administration's orders are indoctrinating rather than educating, and that his research agenda was effectively banned. Parsons described the changes as a professional betrayal and a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG), while simultaneously promoting a fossil fuel phase-out in Asia. This "greenwashing" involves investing in LNG as a "transitional fuel" through initiatives like the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), even though studies show LNG can have higher emissions than coal. Critics argue that Japan's LNG investments hinder the transition to renewable energy in countries like Indonesia, where natural gas is more expensive than renewables. Japan's energy policies prioritize securing access to LNG and reselling surplus, conflicting with global climate goals.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, focusing on attunement to a child's emotional needs. This style emphasizes building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, view "bad" behavior as a signal for help, and take responsibility after conflicts. By doing their own inner work, they create an environment where their child feels safe expressing themselves and showing up as their full, authentic self.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the U.S. of encouraging Vladimir Putin through its "silence" following recent Russian attacks, including the largest aerial assault since the war began. The overnight attacks resulted in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and dozens of injuries across Ukraine. Zelensky stated that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without "strong pressure on the Russian leadership," referring to further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow. He emphasized that the world cannot ignore the ongoing war, regardless of weekends and weekdays.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but the story was his truck getting repossessed due to missed payments after he changed banks. Paul had forgotten to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, leading to it being towed away in the middle of the night. After finding out through his trainer checking security footage, he posted the incident on social media with a Celine Dion soundtrack, and he has since regained possession of the vehicle. The win and the repossession story added an unexpected twist to his tournament experience.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump is again targeting Harvard University, criticizing the school's international students and their home countries after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students are from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." Harvard had argued that the revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment."</p>
