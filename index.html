          <h2>Teaching Union Initiates Legal Action Against Ofsted Over Inspection Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 04:46:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), a teaching union, has launched legal action against Ofsted regarding proposed changes to school inspections in England. The union seeks a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing they represent another crude grading system that will negatively impact school leaders. This action follows concerns raised by educators, including the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who died by suicide after an Ofsted inspection, who fear the changes will harm the wellbeing of education staff and students. Ofsted maintains that the proposed changes support mental health and considers the union's claims untenable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on key auto parts, such as engines, imported into the United States, further straining Japan's car industry, which already faces similar tariffs on automobiles. To mitigate the impact, the administration is offering measures to help manufacturers relocate their supply chains for car parts to the United States over the next two years. Japan's auto industry, a major economic driver, shipped approximately 6 trillion yen worth of vehicles to the United States last year, accounting for a third of Japan's total exports to the world's largest economy. Automakers argue that the complexity of their supply chains makes domestic procurement challenging.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, wounded nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child, as seventeen drones struck civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, houses, and shops. Kharkiv governor Oleg Synegubov reported that the drones hit four parts of the city, causing fires and damage. The attack occurred just before Russia's planned three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed as a superficial gesture, emphasizing that the drones targeted homes rather than military sites. Zelenskyy reiterated calls for increased international pressure on Russia to end the war, highlighting the daily drone attacks across Ukrainian skies.</p>

          <p>Five people, including three women, a child, and the pilot, survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The survivors stood atop the submerged plane, encircled by alligators, and managed to stay alive by eating cassava flour brought by one of the passengers. The pilot believes that leaking petrol from the plane kept the predators at bay, and they also spotted an anaconda in the water. Local fishermen eventually discovered the craft, leading to a helicopter rescue.</p>

          <p>A $400 million national cathedral project in Ghana, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo allocated around $58 million of public funds to the project, which has since stalled, leaving behind only a large, empty construction site. The cathedral, intended as a national monument, has faced criticism for its high cost amid Ghana's economic struggles, leading to accusations of corruption and a government investigation. The current administration has ceased funding and dissolved the agency overseeing the project, reflecting a shift in priorities and public sentiment.</p>

          <p>Crimean Tatars, the indigenous inhabitants of Crimea, express strong opposition to any plan recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, fearing increased oppression and the legitimization of territorial concessions to Russia. Representatives of the Crimean Tatars emphasize their historical struggle for the right to live on their own land and their disappointment with the Ukrainian government's initial response to the Russian annexation. They highlight the importance of Ukraine's principled stance in refusing to recognize Crimea as Russian, as it provides a crucial link between the Crimean Tatars and the free territory of Ukraine. A potential peace treaty that cedes territory to Russia is seen as a betrayal of those who have sacrificed their lives in defense of Ukrainian independence.</p>

          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is not inclined to reconcile with Prince Harry, despite Harry's recent public plea for reconciliation. Hilary Fordwich suggests the gulf between the brothers has widened due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family, while Ian Pelham Turner believes King Charles would have to overrule William if the Sussexes wish to return. Harry's recent interview with the BBC, where he expressed a desire for reconciliation and concerns about his father's health, has done little to bridge the divide, with experts pointing out Harry's perceived hypocrisy and lack of remorse for his own behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that despite a recent minerals deal with the United States, Ukraine will not be able to supplant China as a primary source of critical minerals for US industries in the near future. Most of Ukraine's mineral deposits are located in areas currently occupied by Russia, and the country lacks the necessary processing capacity to compete with China's dominance in rare earth element refining. China controls approximately 60% of the world's rare earth element reserves and is responsible for around 90% of all refining, making it difficult for Ukraine to become a significant player in the critical minerals market.</p>

          <p>A policy review suggests that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths annually a decade after its legalization in England and Wales, though this would still represent less than 1% of all deaths. The review, an official impact assessment, also provides a financial analysis, estimating potential NHS savings ranging from £5.84m to £59.6m after ten years, due to reduced hospital and care costs. However, it also anticipates costs exceeding £10m annually for staffing an assisted dying service, with additional expenses for training and review panels. While proponents emphasize the compassionate aspect of providing choice at the end of life, opponents raise concerns about the potential risks to vulnerable individuals.</p>

The first quarter's figures were challenged by the new administration's plans to overhaul the world economy, with increased imports and decreased consumer spending.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies found in the blood of Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species in animal tests, offering a potential solution to the challenge of matching antivenoms to specific snake species. Friede's 18-year mission, documented on YouTube, aims to create a universal antivenom to combat snakebites, which kill up to 140,000 people annually.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. Visitor numbers have declined from a record high of 6.14 million in 2016, including 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, to only 2.87 million in 2024, with only 50,000 from the aforementioned regions. This decline is attributed to deteriorating cross-strait relations, political factors, and changes in tourism policies. Despite the challenges, museum director Hsiao Tsung-huang remains committed to reaching a target of 3.5 million visitors for the museum's centenary year in 2025.</p>

Romero secured a unanimous decision victory, marking one of boxing's biggest surprises of the year. Garcia acknowledged his year of inactivity contributed to the loss and expressed interest in either a rematch with Romero or a fight with Haney. The fight itself was described as cautious, with Garcia struggling to land his signature left hook after being knocked down by Romero in the second round.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power under the Communist Party. The reforms, led by new party chief To Lam, include merging ministries, closing state-run media outlets, and eliminating approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The goal is to create a more agile state and redirect resources towards economic development. These changes also aim to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign and to strengthen political governance in the face of external pressures, such as potential US tariffs.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other key car parts has come into force in the US, placing further pressure on the automotive industry. President Trump stated that the tariff, along with a similar tax on cars, is intended to incentivize carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US. However, analysts predict that any immediate expansion in the US will likely come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. While concerns about price hikes have prompted a sales surge, General Motors warned that the tariffs could cost it as much as $5 billion this year.</p>
