            <h2>Harvard Rejects Federal Funding Conditions, Leading to Grant Freeze</h2>

            <p>Harvard University has declined to accept the Trump administration's conditions for continued federal funding, citing concerns over its independence and constitutional rights. In response, the administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in contracts. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that while the university is committed to addressing antisemitism, the proposed agreement overreaches the federal government's authority. The university emphasizes the critical role of federal funding in medical, engineering, and scientific breakthroughs, warning that the freeze could harm the nation's health, well-being, and economic security.</p>

            <p>Senior advisors to President Trump privately cautioned that proposed tariffs could destabilize global financial markets and harm the U.S. economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick voiced concerns about the potential for market turmoil and global disaster, advocating for a more targeted approach. Despite these warnings, Navarro pushed for broad tariffs, leading to internal disagreements. After the "Liberation Day" announcement, financial markets reacted negatively, prompting Trump to pause some tariffs for 90 days in response to market anxieties.</p>

            <p>A severe sandstorm swept across central and southern Iraq, leading to over a thousand people seeking medical attention for respiratory issues. The storm, characterized by thick orange haze and reduced visibility, caused power cuts and flight suspensions in several regions. Health officials in Muthanna province reported at least 700 cases of suffocation. Experts suggest that these dust storms are becoming more frequent due to climate change, exacerbating environmental challenges in the region. This event highlights the vulnerability of the population to extreme weather events.</p>

The U.S. government has conceded that Ábrego García's deportation was an error but claims he is a gang member, which his lawyer denies.

            <p>The rotor of the helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River, killing all six people on board, has been recovered. The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred during a tour with a family of Spanish tourists. The helicopter was not equipped with flight records, complicating the investigation. The tour company, New York Helicopter Tours, has ceased operations, and the FAA is reviewing its license and safety record.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, preventing the Trump administration from removing noncitizens subject to the act's proclamation. This decision follows similar rulings in New York and Texas, forming a patchwork of district-level protections against the act's use. The judge declined to rule on the lawfulness of the proclamation but issued the order to preserve the court's jurisdiction. The rulings highlight ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus and other issues. This action follows Harvard's rejection of demands to eliminate DEI programs and screen international students for ideological concerns. Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the government should not dictate private universities' policies, while federal agencies stated that taxpayer support comes with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws. The move intensifies the conflict between the administration and universities over issues of free speech and discrimination.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a significant drop in the number of plays and musicals staged by subsidized UK theatres, declining by almost a third in the past decade. Funding cuts and rising costs are cited as primary reasons for the decrease, impacting the workforce and opportunities for emerging artists. Some venues are co-producing more shows to spread costs, resulting in larger-scale productions. However, smaller-scale and riskier productions are being squeezed out due to financial pressures and changing audience tastes.</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a significant reshoring of supply chains to the U.S. Companies surveyed believe that reshoring could double their costs, leading them to seek lower-tariff countries instead. Cost is the primary reason for not reshoring, followed by challenges in finding skilled labor. The survey also reveals that many companies feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America.
