          <p>President Trump expressed anger at Vladimir Putin for attacking Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's credibility, marking a shift in his previous approach of appeasing Putin.  Trump threatened secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil if a ceasefire isn't reached within a month. This seemingly tough stance could be a strategic maneuver or a genuine change in policy, but the threat of tariffs may not be effective enough to compel Putin to act.</p>
