          <p>A 15-year-old boy in Sheffield, England, admitted to stabbing Harvey Willgoose, also 15, to death at All Saints Catholic High School.

          <p>A letter written by Titanic survivor Archibald Gracie days before the ship's sinking sold for $399,000 at auction. Gracie, a first-class passenger, wrote about the ship, stating he would await his journey's end before judging it, a line now considered prophetic. The letter is believed to be the only one from Gracie written onboard the Titanic. Gracie survived the sinking and later wrote a detailed account of the disaster but died months later due to complications from hypothermia he sustained during the sinking. Relevant context includes the ongoing fascination with the Titanic and the high value placed on historical artifacts related to the tragedy.</p>

This has created uncertainty for community colleges, businesses, and workers involved in electric vehicle and battery production.
