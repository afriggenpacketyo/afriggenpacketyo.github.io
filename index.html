          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu was defeated by American Sebastian Fundora in their world title rematch in Las Vegas, losing via a seventh-round technical knockout. This loss marks a significant setback for Tszyu, being his third defeat in his last four bouts after beginning his career with 24 consecutive wins. The article details key moments of the fight, including Tszyu being knocked down in the first round and suffering a severe cut, which ultimately led his corner to stop the contest before the eighth round began.</p>

          <p>Linda Duffey Gwozdz was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey, despite her unusual claim that the incident was an accident. Her legal strategy, known as the "Bugs Bunny defense," asserted she believed the gun was unloaded after her husband mimicked the cartoon character Elmer Fudd saying "no more buwwets." Prosecutors successfully argued she intentionally shot him twice while he was asleep, and following a mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, resulting in a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

          <p>In the 2016 murder investigation of Nicole Vander Heyden, her boyfriend was initially the primary suspect but was later exonerated by activity data from his Fitbit device. The focus of the investigation then shifted after DNA evidence and Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone were analyzed. This technological evidence was instrumental in identifying, tracking, and ultimately convicting George Steven Burch for the murder, showcasing the pivotal role of personal tech devices in modern criminal justice.</p>

          <p>The United States government is introducing a new, non-waivable $250 "visa integrity fee" for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, set to begin in the 2025 fiscal year. This charge is an addition to existing application costs and will be indexed to inflation in the future. Although the policy includes a provision for reimbursement if travelers fully comply with their visa conditions, the implementation details for this refund process are currently unclear, and immigration experts are advising clients to consider the fee nonrefundable for now.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global demand for green technologies like electric cars is driving a lithium mining boom that is causing a significant environmental crisis in regions such as Chile's Atacama Desert. The extraction process requires vast quantities of water, leading to the depletion of vital groundwater sources, shrinking of natural lagoons, and damage to fragile ecosystems. This situation harms the indigenous communities that rely on the land, creating a paradox where solving one environmental issue exacerbates another.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is promoting a shift in savings habits, urging people to move their money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government plans to send targeted advertisements and messages to savers and has considered reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to encourage the move. However, financial experts warn that this push could be risky without improved financial literacy, particularly for women and first-time investors, and could backfire if not handled carefully.

While still highly exclusive, these new clubs prioritize personal achievement over pedigree, reflecting India's changing economic and social dynamics.</p>
