          <p>A new study reveals that a tiny microchip implant, combined with special glasses, has enabled some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy to read again. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) involves surgically placing a hair-thin implant under the retina, which then communicates with video-camera-equipped glasses. Of 32 participants, 26 showed significant visual acuity improvement after 12 months. While requiring concentration and not yet licensed for widespread treatment, this breakthrough offers substantial hope for the 5 million people worldwide affected by this advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in older individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland, freezing a lower court order that had blocked the move. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the Trump administration is likely to succeed in proving President Trump lawfully invoked Title 10 to federalize and send troops to protect federal immigration personnel and property. Oregon officials strongly objected, arguing the president lacked authority and that his determination was "untethered to the facts." This decision allows the deployment to proceed while the legal challenge continues, sparking concerns about unilateral presidential power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has formally moved to dismiss his federal indictment, asserting that the charges are a result of President Trump's "personal animus" and an "egregious abuse of power." Comey's legal team argues the prosecution is vindictive, pointing to Trump's public statements calling for his prosecution and the indictment's timing just before the statute of limitations expired. Additionally, they challenge the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment, claiming she lacks proper authority to bring the case. The charges relate to Comey's 2020 Senate testimony regarding unauthorized information leaks, which he denies. This legal battle also involves prosecutors questioning Comey's lead counsel over alleged past classified information disclosure, adding another layer to the high-stakes proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Persistent Metal Detectorist Unearths Rare 18th-Century Spanish Coin on Nantucket Beach</h2>

          <p>Hobbyist Travis Nichols, a known metal detectorist on Nantucket, discovered a rare 1782 silver Spanish one-reale coin on a south shore beach, marking a significant personal achievement. Nichols, who already boasts a collection of over 300 coins, described the finding as "an amazing feeling," valuing it above helping others find lost jewelry, for which he is locally renowned. He believes the coin was minted in Mexico City, traversing a long historical path to Nantucket, and notes its relative youth compared to other island finds from the 1650s. This discovery highlights the potential of the location, where he previously unearthed a historic clipped penny, prompting him to continue exploring the spot for more hidden treasures.</p>

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) has caused widespread disruptions to numerous popular websites and applications for over 12 hours. The incident, originating in AWS's US-East-1 region, was initially linked to DNS problems with its DynamoDB database service, which underpins many other AWS applications. Companies like Disney+, Lyft, McDonald's, Reddit, and various airline services reported issues, highlighting the global reliance on a few major cloud providers. The outage also affected Amazon's internal operations and customer support, with warehouse workers experiencing system downtime. While AWS reports signs of recovery, the incident underscores the fragility of modern internet infrastructure and the broad impact when a central service experiences technical difficulties, reminding users of their dependence on a handful of providers.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into last month's Lisbon funicular crash, which killed 16 people, has detailed numerous systemic failings. The investigation by Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigations Bureau found that an underground counterweight cable, which snapped and caused the derailment, was defective and never certified for passenger transport. It was acquired by the public transport company Carris in 2022 without proper engineering oversight or pre-installation testing. Additionally, the emergency brake system failed, and the state body responsible for funicular oversight did not cover the Glória line. The mayor attributed the tragedy to technical causes, while Carris noted the same cables had been in use for 601 days without incident.</p>

          <p>Andrew Garcia, a Lakers fan, has dropped his small claims lawsuit against LeBron James after the PrizePicks fantasy sports app offered to compensate him for ticket losses. Garcia had sued after James's "decision of all decisions" announcement, which many interpreted as a retirement tease, turned out to be unrelated to his NBA career. Believing he had overpaid for what he thought would be James's farewell tour tickets, Garcia received promo funds equivalent to his $865.66 ticket cost, along with future game tickets and merchandise from PrizePicks. This resolution satisfied Garcia, who felt fully compensated, thus eliminating the need for further legal action against the NBA superstar.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the U.S. Constitution, highlighting its design for amendment and evolution over two centuries. Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen discuss how amendments like the 13th and 19th addressed slavery and women's suffrage, embodying the founders' intent for a "work in progress." They note the initial slender support for its ratification and the crucial role of Article V in allowing citizens to change it. While the Supreme Court now frequently reinterprets the Constitution, founders primarily envisioned change through amendments. Concerns are raised about checks and balances not functioning as intended, with Congress inactive and courts overly powerful, yet the Constitution's core principles of freedom remain eternal.</p>

          <p>Billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, a key figure in the "PayPal mafia" and an OpenAI investor, publicly defended AI startup Anthropic, calling it "one of the good guys." This came after David Sacks, President Trump's AI and crypto czar, criticized Anthropic for allegedly using "fear-mongering" to drive regulatory capture. Hoffman, also an investor in Anthropic via Greylock, emphasized the importance of deploying AI "the right way, thoughtfully, safely, and enormously beneficial for society." The public spat highlights the growing political divisions within the tech industry regarding AI safety and regulation, with prominent figures aligning on opposing sides.</p>

          <p>The article introduces "reparteras," women artists navigating Cuba's largely unknown but burgeoning reparto music scene, a hyperkinetic fusion of reggaetón, timba, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. Originating in working-class neighborhoods, reparto lyrics often contain misogynistic and objectifying language, reflecting deep-seated machismo in Cuban society, despite the genre's focus on women. Artists like Seidy La Niña, Melanie Santiler, and Ozunaje are challenging these norms, reclaiming derogatory terms and striving for recognition against male counterparts. They face pressure to conform to beauty standards and authenticity critiques, but aim to evolve the genre's vocabulary and themes beyond "bedroom conquests" to achieve broader appeal and respect.</p>

          <p>California's new Pay Equity Enforcement Act (SB 642), signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to significantly reduce the Latina wage gap, identified as the widest in the nation. Effective January 2026, the law strengthens the California Equal Pay Act by expanding the definition of "wages" to include non-traditional compensation like stocks and benefits. It requires employers to provide "good faith estimates" of pay, updates gender language, and extends the statute of limitations for wage claims to six years for ongoing discriminatory practices. This legislation offers hope for Latina professionals, who, despite educational advancements, face substantial lifetime wage losses compared to white male counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes former President Trump's reaction to the nationwide "No Kings" protests, specifically his use of an AI-generated video depicting himself as "King Trump" dropping sewage on protesters. The author draws parallels to authoritarian tactics, where leaders smear critics to discourage participation and delegitimize dissent. Republicans echoed this, labeling protesters as "Marxists" or "paid agents." The piece argues that while protests raise awareness, true democratic change requires organized political action. It suggests Trump's "scatological propaganda" is an attempt to deter engagement, questioning whether Americans still care enough about democratic ideals to be "radicalized by basic decency" in response.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Border Patrol official defended the use of tear gas on Chicago protesters during immigration enforcement sweeps, stating that agents were prevented from leaving a scene and the situation became dangerous. In a court hearing, Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander, testified that 201 Border Patrol agents in the Chicago area are now equipped with body cameras, ordered by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis. This development follows a lawsuit by news organizations and community groups protesting the Trump administration's crackdown, which has led to over 1,000 arrests and complaints of combative tactics. The judge had previously mandated badges and banned certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters.</p>

While mirror biomolecule research is widely supported for therapeutic advancements, the creation of entire mirror cells poses catastrophic risks, including potential evasion of immune systems, lack of natural predators, and ecosystem collapse, possibly leading to mass extinction. Many experts, including UNESCO's International Bioethics Committee, recommend a global moratorium on creating mirror cells. However, some scientists argue the risks are theoretical and that such research could unlock new understandings of life's origins and offer unique therapeutic benefits, suggesting computational research to assess threats before biological creation.</p>

This timing allows investors to better estimate current-year income and conduct multi-year tax projections. The article notes tax uncertainty in 2025 due to expiring Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions and ongoing debates about Affordable Care Act subsidies, which can impact conversion eligibility for younger retirees. While some advisors suggest earlier conversions for faster tax-free growth, others caution against it before solid income estimates are available.
