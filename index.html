          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, Asean is strategically positioning itself by leveraging a new free-trade agreement with China and potential tariff discussions with the US. The upgraded trade agreement with China aims to deepen economic integration through digital trade, green initiatives, and supply chain connectivity, while Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks trade fairness for Asean's export-driven economies. Asean aims to foster a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy by capitalizing on the US-China rivalry.

          <p>A new study indicates that parents, compared to childfree individuals, experience a greater sense of meaning in life but report lower levels of life satisfaction, particularly among mothers. The findings, based on data from the European Social Survey, reveal that this discrepancy is influenced by factors such as living situation and family policies in different countries. Scandinavian countries exhibit smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies. The study emphasizes the importance of societal support and gender equality in improving parental well-being.</p>

          <p>A debate is ongoing in China regarding the promotion of a Communist Party cadre who was previously disciplined for misconduct, raising concerns about the practice of reinstating officials after disciplinary actions. State media has presented the case as a positive example of rehabilitation, but the public has expressed frustration over officials being "rewarded" for their past misdeeds. This trend reflects an effort by Beijing to incentivize officials amid an anti-corruption campaign and economic challenges. Many view this as undermining accountability and fairness in governance.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a sharp increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts linking this trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation has reduced citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of processed foods with low nutritional value. The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but it faces criticism for stigmatizing individuals and overlooking broader economic issues. Experts advocate for a nationwide free school meal program and stricter regulations on unhealthy food marketing.</p>

Trump's trade policies and criticisms of Taiwan's defense spending undermine confidence in US support, potentially emboldening China. The author suggests that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, rather than principles, and that China may perceive an opportunity to take Taiwan due to Trump's perceived weakness.</p>

Governing body World Skate instituted the limit, which would have ruled some of Japan's previous Olympic medal-winning skateboarders ineligible. Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries reported among growing children as the technical difficulty of tricks rises, and Hayakawa believes the average age of the Japan national team would naturally not go any lower.</p>
