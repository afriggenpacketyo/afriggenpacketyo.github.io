          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The research, published in Science, indicates that the languages and traditions of present-day Indigenous groups can be traced back to these early settlers, with genetic codes revealing patterns of population history, migration, and adaptation over thousands of years. The study also highlights the isolation of groups in different environments, which led to distinct genetic traits and mutations affecting modern South Americans' health, emphasizing the importance of ancestral knowledge for cultural preservation and tailored healthcare. The findings corroborate archaeological evidence and offer insights into the closest living relatives of Indigenous North Americans.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through the Midwest, resulting in at least seven deaths and widespread damage across Missouri. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed five deaths in her city, with over 5,000 homes affected and 100,000 customers without power. The storms tore roofs off buildings, blew out windows, and downed trees and power lines, leading to a state of emergency and an overnight curfew in the most damaged neighborhoods. National Weather Service radar indicated a tornado touched down in Clayton, Missouri, causing significant damage to buildings, including Centennial Christian Church, where one person died during a rescue. The storms were part of a larger weather system that brought severe conditions to multiple states, including tornadoes in Wisconsin and a heat wave in Texas.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a search and raising concerns about security failures and potential assistance from within the Sheriff’s Office. The inmates, who made their exit through a hole in a cell wall, were seen on surveillance video leaving the facility in civilian clothes after shedding their orange jail uniforms, then scaling a wall and running across an interstate. Authorities have recaptured three of the escapees, and are warning that the remaining seven should be considered armed and dangerous. The escape has led to criticism of the Sheriff’s Office, with officials questioning how the inmates managed to escape and why the public was not immediately notified.</p>

          <p>President Trump has implemented a series of tariffs on specific countries and industries, with some paused and others still active. Currently in place are a 10% universal tariff, a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts (with exceptions), a 30% tariff on Chinese imports (with exceptions), and a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered in the USMCA. Paused tariffs include “reciprocal” tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods, while exemptions have been made for goods from Canada and Mexico covered in the USMCA and tariffs on smartphones, computers, and other electronics imported from China. Trump continues to threaten more tariffs on specific industries, though the future implementation of these tariffs remains uncertain.</p>

Taiwan’s foreign ministry stated that both countries notified them in advance of their officials' attendance and that relations remained “friendly and stable”. The presence of these nations at the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum highlights the ongoing diplomatic pressure from Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of China.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in the center of the Gaza Strip early Saturday, hours after the Israeli military announced its forces had begun mobilizing for a broader advance into the territory. The shots, audible from Deir al Balah, prompted some civilians to flee westward, as mediators sought to broker a new temporary truce. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has continued since October 7, 2023, resulting in a significant death toll and widespread hunger amid a collapse in humanitarian aid due to an Israeli blockade. Despite the ongoing military campaign, Hamas has vowed not to release the remaining hostages unless Israel ends the war and withdraws from Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Polish government's approval ratings have declined due to President Andrzej Duda's obstruction of reform plans, making the upcoming presidential election crucial for the pro-European, center-left government led by Donald Tusk. The outcome of the election will determine whether Tusk's government can advance its agenda, which has been hindered by President Duda's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court. Tusk is backing Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, while the opposition conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party supports Karol Nawrocki, with polls indicating a runoff election between Trzaskowski and Nawrocki is likely. The election is seen as pivotal for Poland's political direction and the future of Tusk's government.</p>

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called the verdict a "sham trial" and asserted that Jenkins, as a member of Ukraine's regular armed forces, must be treated as a prisoner of war under international law. Wong stated that the Australian government has made clear to Russia that Jenkins must be given the protections afforded to him as a prisoner of war, and that Australia will work with Ukraine and the Red Cross to ensure his welfare and seek his release.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity, months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to remember key dates and slurring his words. In February 2024, Biden responded to questions about Hur's description of him as a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory' by asserting his competence and experience. Hur's report, along with gaffes during public appearances, amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, eventually leading to Biden's withdrawal from his re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>A dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing visibility to drop to zero in some spots and disrupting travel and outdoor activities. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so and the first time including the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air. Planes were grounded at Midway International Airport, and expressways were backed up as drivers navigated the wall of dust, creating an eerie and unsettling experience for residents.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs's trial hinges on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura, who described years of abuse and drug-fueled sexual encounters. Ventura's emotional testimony detailed alleged beatings and coerced participation in "freak-offs," influencing the federal sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution case against Combs. Prosecutors aim to prove Combs was not just an abuser but a mastermind of a criminal enterprise, emphasizing elements of sex trafficking and racketeering. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges, while his attorneys concede he was abusive but argue domestic violence is distinct from sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>During his tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, President Trump was treated with great honor and respect, receiving economic investments and praise. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the U.S. and the three nations, while also receiving a standing ovation in Saudi Arabia and the country’s highest civilian honor in the UAE. The visit stood in contrast to the backlash he faced at home, where his policies and ethics were often questioned. This trip allowed him to announce economic investments, surround himself with friendly audiences, and avoid controversies related to his family's business dealings.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in the Bosnian city of Gorazde fear they may not survive the tariffs imposed on goods sent to their biggest market, the United States. Trump's tariffs on imports from Bosnia have disrupted the industry, leading to stalled expansion plans and potential loss of American customers. The town’s mayor worries that the United States has abandoned its faith in free trade and economic development as a path to peace. With a divided leadership in Bosnia, the future of the ammunition industry in Gorazde remains uncertain, leaving the town’s mayor aghast.</p>
