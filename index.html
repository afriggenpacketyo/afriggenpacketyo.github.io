          <p>Hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was sentenced to 50 months in prison for prostitution-related charges involving his former girlfriends. The judge emphasized the need for a significant deterrent, rejecting defense arguments for leniency based on Combs' alleged reform and community contributions. Combs apologized in court, expressing remorse for his "disgusting, shameful, and sick" actions, but the judge remained unconvinced he wouldn't reoffend, citing continued abusive behavior. This article details the court proceedings, including victim testimony and the defense's portrayal of Combs' character.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly planning a "showy" public arrest of former Director James Comey, who was recently indicted for lying to Congress and obstruction. A supervisory special agent, Chris Ray, was suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate, deeming the tactic inappropriate for a white-collar defendant. This article highlights the controversy surrounding perp walks and the escalating feud between Comey and former President Trump. Comey's indictment followed a swift change in the Eastern District of Virginia's lead prosecutor.</p>

          <p>A political dispute has erupted over whether California is using a Medicaid "provider tax" loophole to secure federal funds for undocumented immigrants' healthcare, a practice Republicans claim Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" aimed to close. Democrats and health policy experts deny this, stating federal law bars such use for non-emergency care. This article highlights the difficulty in verifying these claims, as states don't track how provider tax funds are spent, fueling the ongoing debate amidst a government shutdown.

Researchers in Switzerland are developing neuron clusters, or organoids, from stem cells, connecting them to electrodes to process simple commands. This article explores the potential for these biocomputers to replicate AI learning with significantly less energy, despite challenges in sustaining them and ethical considerations about their "death." The technology is still in early stages but holds promise for disease modeling.</p>

The author's father expresses bewilderment at the modern pressures, such as exorbitant apartment prices in top school districts, highlighting the shift from a simpler system to one driven by intense competition and significant financial investment for children's schooling. The piece underscores the sacrifices families make across generations for educational advancement.</p>

          <p>American intelligence officials allege Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly approved drone attacks on two Gaza-bound humanitarian aid vessels off Tunisia last month, causing fires but no injuries. This article states that incendiary devices were dropped from a submarine onto the boats, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, which included figures like Greta Thunberg. The flotilla condemned the attacks, demanding investigations, while Tunisian authorities initially disputed drone involvement. The U.S. State Department called the flotilla a "deliberate and unnecessary provocation" amidst peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Hamas's agreement to release remaining hostages, albeit with conditions, offers significant hope for Israeli families, as outlined in this article's analysis. The group accepted the proposal's exchange formula for hundreds of detained Palestinians, and the idea of Gaza's governance by Palestinian technocrats. However, crucial elements like Hamas laying down its arms are conspicuously absent. Despite President Trump urging an immediate halt to Israeli bombing, skepticism remains within Israel's cabinet, highlighting the complex negotiations still required before regional peace can become a reality.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark law allowing California's hundreds of thousands of Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize and collectively bargain while retaining independent contractor status. This article details the rare compromise between labor and tech, exempting workers from antitrust laws and outlining a process for union formation through signature collection. In return, Uber and Lyft will see significantly reduced insurance requirements for accidents involving uninsured drivers.
