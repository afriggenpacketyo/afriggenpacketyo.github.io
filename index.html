          <p>The article reflects on Saturday Night Live's 50th season, highlighting its continued relevance and creative success. Despite constant speculation about its demise, SNL remains a powerful comedy brand, finishing the season as the top broadcast entertainment program among viewers aged 18 to 49, with an average of 8.2 million viewers per week across all platforms. The article considers the future of Weekend Update and the show's ability to lampoon modern politics, suggesting that SNL should focus on finding new angles rather than trying to nail the political moment every week. The show's massive celebration of its 50th anniversary reminded audiences of its cultural significance in a world where comedy brands are increasingly built on podcasts and social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not controlled by NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. The National Intelligence Council report contradicted the Trump administration's claims, which were used to justify the deportation of suspected gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Rubio cites an FBI assessment, claiming the gang is exported by the Venezuelan regime and has been contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. He argues the Venezuelan government actively encourages the gang to leave the country, and members are greeted as heroes upon return, suggesting cooperation between the regime and the gang.</p>

The Princess credits her mother, Sarah Ferguson, for helping her view the resulting scar as a "badge of honour", highlighting the importance of showing "people your scars".

          <p>The article recounts the story of Nike's decision to bet on Michael Jordan 40 years ago, a move that revolutionized the sneaker industry. Howard White, a Nike veteran, recalls the meeting with Jordan and his parents, where Nike offered Jordan $2.5 million to wear their shoes, triple what anyone else in the league was making. The Air Jordan shoe generated $126 million in sales in its first year, far exceeding Nike's expectations. The Jordan Brand, now a standalone division within Nike, generates approximately $7 billion annually, with Jordan still involved in the brand's operation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ancient Hawaiian tradition of lei making, highlighting its cultural significance and the challenges it faces. Leis are given for nearly every occasion as an expression of aloha and love. However, suburban sprawl and climate change have reduced flower farms, leading to 90% of flowers being imported. Lei makers are adapting by using alternative materials like unripe fruit and wood beads to create "forever leis", but this breaks from tradition. The article also touches on the Annual Lei Day Celebration, where master lei makers compete for the best in show.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists uncovered details of a Pompeii family's desperate attempt to survive the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Excavations at the House of Helle and Phrixus revealed a family barricaded a bedroom door with a bed to protect themselves from volcanic rock fragments. The remains of at least four people, including a child wearing a bronze bulla amulet, were found inside. Various pantry items, including amphorae and bronze vessels, were also discovered, providing insights into daily life in Ancient Rome. The house's name comes from a mythological painting found on one of its walls.</p>

Pence argues that Qatar has a history of "playing both sides," and accepting such a gift is inconsistent with U.S. security and intelligence needs. He suggests Qatar should instead invest the $400 million in infrastructure on U.S. military bases.

The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland expressed disappointment, hinting at a potential override of the veto.

The barrage has come just a day before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US President has been urging a ceasefire.

          <p>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna stated that while there was no cover-up of former President Joe Biden's mental fitness, Democrats must acknowledge their mistakes. Khanna defended Biden's accomplishments, such as the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, but reiterated his belief that Biden made a mistake in seeking a second term. Khanna emphasized Biden's resilience and remarkable life, but maintained that pursuing another four years in the White House was not the right decision.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with top U.S. officials and European leaders in Rome, coinciding with Russia's largest drone attack on Ukraine since the invasion began. Zelenskyy spoke with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as part of stepped-up diplomatic efforts ahead of a high-stakes phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war in Ukraine. The intensified diplomacy comes as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>UK strawberry growers are anticipating a sweet harvest in 2025, thanks to warm days and cooler nights. The weather conditions allow strawberries to rest and put the energy they have gained during the day into producing high natural sugars. Despite concerns about potential drought conditions, growers have irrigation systems in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. Farmers are also using techniques like adding black pepper or balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavors of the strawberries.</p>
