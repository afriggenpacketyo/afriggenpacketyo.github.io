          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has declared that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to do so. The announcement drew praise from Palestinian officials and condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated the move "rewards terror." The United States also voiced its rejection of the decision, while the UK's Prime Minister is facing increased pressure to follow France's lead amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college athletics, directing federal agencies to enforce new provisions on scholarships and athlete compensation. The order seeks to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels and aims to control name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals that are not based on fair market value. This move represents a significant federal intervention into the landscape of college sports following a recent legal settlement that allows direct pay to players.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by the Trump administration are speaking out, describing their terminations as arbitrary and an attack on the rule of law. The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases, claim they were given no cause for their dismissal and allege they were pressured on how to rule in certain cases. Their firings come as the immigration court system faces a backlog of nearly four million cases and over 100 judges have left since 2024.</p>
