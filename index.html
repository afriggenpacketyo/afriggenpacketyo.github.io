          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from deporting Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence compromises U.S. foreign policy. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, temporarily halts the deportation, giving the government a chance to appeal. The judge emphasized that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged, and his speech was being chilled, constituting irreparable harm. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on other alleged issues with his green card application.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to repeal environmental regulations on coal and natural-gas power plants, targeting Biden-era policies aimed at limiting air and climate pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to repeal rules regulating carbon emissions and tightening regulations on mercury and other toxins. Environmental groups are expected to sue to block the changes, arguing they violate environmental laws and disregard scientific evidence. This action aligns with the administration's broader effort to stimulate the fossil fuel industry, despite scientific warnings about the accelerating impact of human-driven climate change.</p>
