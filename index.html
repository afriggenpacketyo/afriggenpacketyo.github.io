          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned as a unifying monument and a personal pledge by former President Akufo-Addo, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Designed by architect David Adjaye, the $400 million project has stalled due to Ghana's economic crisis, with only a large hole dug in Accra. The new government has ceased funding, dissolved the managing agency, and launched an anticorruption initiative, Operation Recover All Loot, targeting the project. The New York Times article highlights how the cathedral, initially intended to unify Ghanaian Christians, has instead faced criticism and accusations of financial impropriety, with many now questioning its necessity amidst the country's economic struggles.</p>

          <p>This article from DW examines the perspectives of Crimean Tatars regarding the possibility of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Many Crimean Tatars express fears of renewed oppression and loss of their homeland, citing historical injustices under Russian and Soviet rule. While some acknowledge the need to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, they worry that legitimizing territorial concessions to Russia would invalidate the sacrifices made for Ukrainian independence and could lead to political imprisonment for those in occupied territories. The article underscores the Crimean Tatars' disappointment with the international community and their reliance on the Ukrainian government's principled stance against recognizing Crimea as Russian.</p>

          <p>According to Fox News, royal experts suggest Prince William is not inclined to reconcile with Prince Harry despite the latter's recent plea for reconciliation. Hilary Fordwich stated that the "gulf has widened" due to Harry's public criticisms of the royal family, while Ian Pelham Turner believes King Charles will need to overrule William if Harry and Meghan wish to return. Harry's recent BBC interview, where he expressed a desire for reconciliation and concerns about his father's health, has not eased the situation, with experts pointing to a lack of remorse from Harry regarding his own behavior.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent agreement with the United States, analysts believe it will take years for Ukraine to become a significant source of critical minerals, capable of challenging China's dominance in the sector. The South China Morning Post article notes that many of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in regions currently occupied by Russia, and the country lacks the processing capacity necessary for extraction. China controls a substantial portion of the world's rare earth element reserves and refining capabilities, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near term. The US-Ukraine minerals deal aims to establish a fund using royalties from Ukrainian natural resource projects.</p>

          <p>A new impact assessment, reported by the BBC, estimates that assisted deaths in England and Wales could exceed 4,000 per year within a decade if the law is changed to allow it. The report, created to inform MPs, provides financial analysis, projecting potential NHS savings from reduced end-of-life care costs ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m annually after ten years. However, it also highlights significant costs associated with staffing and training for an assisted dying service. The bill, returning to the House of Commons, faces a crucial vote to determine its passage into law.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is navigating his first major election amidst rising global trade tensions and domestic concerns, according to DW. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled for 50 years, faces a challenge from a rejuvenated opposition, particularly regarding the cost of living and housing availability. With the US imposing tariffs on Singapore-made goods and potential recession looming due to the US-China trade war, Wong emphasizes the need for a strong mandate to steer the country through economic uncertainty.

          <p>According to The Guardian, Donald Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the US economy is off to a chaotic start, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP due to trade distortions and weaker consumer spending. Trump has blamed the "Biden Overhang" for any negative economic indicators, while taking credit for positive reports. The article suggests that Trump's erratic tariff policies have created confusion and uncertainty, impacting business investment and consumer confidence. The report raises concerns about the potential for a recession, noting that the foundations of a potential economic downturn were laid by the administration's handling of trade policies.</p>

Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from various deadly snakes in animal tests. This could be a significant step toward a universal antivenom, as current therapies need to match the specific venomous snake. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins and, in experiments on mice, protected against fatal doses from 13 of 19 species of venomous snake.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" to modernize the state, boost economic growth, and consolidate political power, reports DW. Spearheaded by party chief To Lam, the reforms involve merging ministries, shuttering state-run media outlets, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes also aim to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign. External pressures, such as the threat of US tariffs, add urgency to the reforms. Analysts suggest the restructuring will benefit To Lam by centralizing governance and tightening party discipline.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies, according to CBS News. The lawsuit claims that these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement and cites a specific instance where a Venezuelan gang allegedly took over an apartment complex in Aurora due to these policies. Local officials deny the claims, but the lawsuit seeks to invalidate the laws and ordinances that prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities. Colorado's governor's office has responded by stating that Colorado is not a sanctuary state.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry, the BBC reports. The new tariff, part of President Trump's plan to promote domestic manufacturing, follows similar levies on imported cars. While some measures have been eased to address business worries, analysts anticipate higher costs for businesses and consumers. General Motors has warned of significant new costs, while other companies have withdrawn financial guidance due to the uncertainty. The tariffs are expected to impact new and used vehicle prices, as well as repair and insurance costs.</p>

The expansion of the loophole had spurred the growth of low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, leading to a surge in digital advertising. However, with President Trump ending the exemption, these companies now face tariffs of up to 145 percent. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China, while both Temu and Shein have reduced their advertising spending.</p>
