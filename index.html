          <h2>Trump's Stance on China Tariffs Remains Firm, Demanding 'Substantial' Concessions</h2>

          <p>President Trump has stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless they provide something 'substantial' in return, emphasizing his desire for a more open Chinese market for U.S. businesses and products. During a press gaggle on Air Force One, Trump explained that he wants China to allow the U.S. to "go in and work China" and sell American goods, expressing frustration that a previous deal nearly achieved this goal before China backed out. He suggested that opening China to U.S. businesses would be a significant win, but he's uncertain if he'll even ask for it, as China may resist the idea.</p>

          <p>World leaders are gathering on Saturday to pay their respects to Pope Francis, whose church has more members than their states have citizens. But they may also use the Pope's funeral as a rare and unexpected opportunity to conduct a little impromptu diplomacy. For it will be one of the largest gatherings of global heads of state and government since the funeral of the late Queen in 2022. Diplomats said there were few plans for formal meetings between government leaders because that would not be in the spirit of what is a solemn occasion. All eyes will, of course, be on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky use the opportunity of being in the same place to discuss the prospects of a ceasefire in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>World leaders and dignitaries are converging in Vatican City to attend Pope Francis's funeral, marking one of the largest gatherings of global figures since Queen Elizabeth's funeral. While formal meetings are limited out of respect for the solemn occasion, diplomats anticipate opportunities for informal "brush-by" conversations and potential impromptu diplomacy. Attention is focused on whether Presidents Trump and Zelensky will engage in discussions regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine, amidst existing tensions between the two leaders. The funeral mass itself presents a chance for leaders to interact, though historical precedents suggest potential for awkward encounters, like unexpected handshakes with controversial figures.</p>

          <p>From banning reporters from the Oval Office to trying to dismantle VOA, Trump’s moves against the press have sparked legal battles, with experts warning that press freedom — and US democracy itself — is threatened. The Trump administration is widely expected to introduce a memo to block federal funding for NPR and CBS in coming weeks. The idea that taxpayer money, that government money would go to support a news outlet that is seeking to provide verifiable and independent reporting with its own editorial judgment is an affront to the idea that somehow [Trump] controls every message, he controls every news cycle, he controls every editorial judgment. It's a principle that you often find people don't really want to talk about, or they don't quite get why it would relate to them, until they're under threat of targeting or silencing or chilling, and we're in a real anti-free speech and anti-accountability, anti-democratic moment.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on how organisations should interpret the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex in law. The new guidance says that, in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, "trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities". It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. The EHRC said it was releasing interim guidance because "many people have questions about the judgement and what it means for them".</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance on single-sex spaces in the UK, following a Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' in the 2010 Equality Act as biological sex. The guidance states that trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals, shops, and restaurants, while ensuring that trans people are not left without any facilities to use. In schools, pupils who identify as trans girls (biological boys) should not be permitted to use the girls' toilet or changing facilities, with similar restrictions for trans boys. The EHRC plans to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from stakeholders and aims to provide an updated code of practice to the government by the end of June.</p>

          <p>With what's being called a mini-heatwave looming for the UK, it's not just humans looking forward to warmer weather. The warm spell is expected to give a temporary boost to nature as migratory birds arrive from afar and butterflies stretch their wings. The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) says a succession of milder winters and wetter springs are all contributing to change in the natural world. While a brief warm spell won't make much difference to the natural world overall, it could be a bonus for nature lovers. Wildlife charities say it's a great time to get out and about and enjoy nature, but people should be on their guard against accidentally starting a fire.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for a mini-heatwave, which is expected to provide a temporary boost to nature as migratory birds arrive and butterflies emerge. Wildlife charities are urging people to be cautious about starting fires, as dry conditions create a high risk of wildfires, particularly in heathland areas. While the warm spell is seen as a positive for nature lovers, climate change is already having a significant impact on wildlife, with increased intensity of wildfires posing a threat to rare species. Some studies suggest that warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump said Friday that the United States is "very close" to a deal with Japan as the two countries continue talks over U.S. tariffs. His remarks came as Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief representative in tariff negotiations with the U.S. administration, is set to make a three-day trip to Washington from Wednesday for a second round of talks. The members of the family including Toyota Motor Chairman Akio Toyoda are proposing to purchase Toyota Industries shares they do not yet own in a tender offer, with major lenders helping finance the deal, according to the sources. As you craft and implement your administration's North Korea policy, we believe that you have the unique opportunity to once again bring the plight of these Japanese abductees to global attention and make meaningful progress in delivering justice for them and their families.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate with Pakistan following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's military modernization efforts are facing a critical test. India has vowed retaliation and threatened to disrupt the flow of a major river system into Pakistan, raising the stakes in the ongoing conflict. The last face-off between the two countries in 2019 exposed shortcomings in India's military preparedness, prompting significant investments in modernization, arms procurement, and domestic defense manufacturing. The effectiveness of these efforts will now be scrutinized as the region teeters on the brink of another military confrontation.</p>

          <p>I moved to the United States from Egypt in 2000 and I have spent the past 25 years watching the US turn into Egypt – from encroaching state power to the increasingly unchecked role of religion in politics. White Americans are the largest voting bloc and the group most responsible for bringing Trump to power both times – and they are the least enraged. If Pete “I want a crusade and I have enough Crusader crosses to earn it” Hegseth were a Muslim, the US would have invaded his country to save the “free world” from his jihad. It is easy to see theocracy when the theocrats and zealots don’t look like you. As a feminist, I am especially enraged at the inability of US media, as well as many white people generally, to see what religion has done to women in the US.</p>

Eltahawy expresses frustration at what she sees as a lack of outrage among white Americans, who she believes are too confident in the ability of institutions to protect them from autocratic power.

The case has drawn attention due to Attorney General Pam Bondi's call for the death penalty and concerns about Mangione receiving special treatment.

          <p>The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation. Previously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open. That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth. An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.</p>
