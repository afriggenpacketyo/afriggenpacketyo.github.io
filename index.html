          <p>A current Milwaukee County judge, Hannah Dugan, and former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano, along with his wife, were arrested on charges related to assisting undocumented immigrants, prompting accusations of political intimidation from Democrats. Dugan is accused of obstructing an immigration arrest, while Cano is charged with tampering with evidence related to an alleged gang member he was housing. Attorney General Pam Bondi dismissed claims of intimidation, asserting that "no one is above the law," while critics argue the actions undermine judicial independence. The arrests have ignited a debate about the administration's approach to immigration enforcement and its potential impact on the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges in New York, the maximum sentence.

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a mixed trading day, concluding a week marked by volatility due to trade war uncertainties and conflicting signals from the White House. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw modest gains, the Nasdaq Composite rose more substantially, driven by Big Tech stocks. Several companies, including Intel and Eastman Chemical, cautioned about the difficulty in providing financial forecasts due to trade-related uncertainty. Despite these concerns, a pause in "reciprocal tariffs" and a potential easing of tariffs on China offered some relief, though analysts warn that remaining levies could still hinder economic growth.

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, with the U.S. dollar index losing approximately 9% since President Trump's return to the White House. Trump's tariff policies have led investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar and boosting other currencies and gold. Concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and the risk of a U.S. recession have also contributed to the dollar's decline. Speculative traders have increased their bets against the dollar, reaching the most short dollar position since September 2024.</p>

          <p>Insiders holding the $TRUMP meme coin will have to wait an additional 90 days before they can sell their tokens, delaying the release of a significant tranche of insider-held tokens. The decision aims to prevent a "rug pull" and reassure retail investors that early backers won't immediately flood the market. The $TRUMP token has drawn scrutiny for its association with President Trump, with senators calling for an ethics investigation into a promotion offering dinner with the president to top token holders. The coin has no underlying product or service.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that creatine, a common and inexpensive dietary supplement, may be a potential treatment for depression. Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that aids in energy production in both muscles and the brain. Studies have shown that creatine supplementation can improve brain metabolism and ease depression symptoms, especially when combined with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. A recent study in India indicates that creatine may also be helpful in treating depression without the use of antidepressants, though the findings are preliminary and require further research.</p>

Some argue that focusing on the plight of deportees like Kilmar Abrego Garcia elevates immigration as an issue, potentially aiding President Trump, while others believe it is a moral imperative to defend due process rights. While some strategists fear that such actions reinforce the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over the American middle class, others maintain that the political costs are negligible so long as Democrats keep their messaging about immigration disciplined and eventually shift their rhetorical focus to Trump’s economic mismanagement.</p>
