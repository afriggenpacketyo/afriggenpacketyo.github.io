            <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration permission to resume deportations of migrants claimed to be members of a Venezuelan gang, utilizing a rarely-invoked wartime authority. The high court split 5-4 in granting emergency relief, stating that detainees challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, making the venue for their case improper in Washington, D.C. The court confirmed that detainees subject to the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump is pushing forward with tariffs despite market turmoil, a shift from his first term when the stock market and cable news influenced his decisions. Advisors say he is focused on fundamentally remaking the American economy, even if it means short-term pain. The long-term goal of the tariffs is unclear, causing confusion within his administration. Republicans and business leaders express concern over the economic impact, but Trump remains committed to his policies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration in its effort to deport individuals it identifies as Venezuelan gang members. The court overturned a lower court order that had prevented deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. While the order allows deportations to proceed, it also mandates judicial review and adequate notice for those subject to removal. The decision reflects ongoing tensions between the administration and federal courts regarding executive power.</p>
