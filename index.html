          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a cost-cutting plan of 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) and withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 after experiencing a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company attributes the downturn to a drop in wholesales, adverse currency effects, and increased competition in the electric vehicle market. The cost-cutting measures will include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across Volvo's global operations, with more details to be released soon. Shares of Volvo Cars fell significantly following the announcement, reflecting investor concerns about the company's future performance.</p>

          <p>Japan and the Philippines are set to begin discussions on key security pacts to strengthen their ties, with China's increasing maritime activities in mind. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. are expected to confirm joint coast guard drills and exchange views on the global economy amid U.S. tariffs. The focus is on an intelligence-sharing pact and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement to facilitate defense supplies and logistical support. Both countries, close U.S. allies, have been boosting cooperation due to concerns over China's assertive territorial claims in the South and East China Seas.</p>

          <p>Young voters in Australia, now outnumbering baby boomers, are poised to express their frustration over climate inaction in the upcoming election. Inspired by activists like Greta Thunberg, many feel disempowered by current and former governments' insufficient efforts to address the climate crisis. They are demanding more aggressive emissions reductions and a faster transition to renewable energy, and they are increasingly likely to vote for minor parties and independent candidates who prioritize climate action. However, they are also struggling with housing and cost-of-living issues, and some are disengaging from democracy altogether, seeing current government targets as too abstract and demanding immediate action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, has won the federal election, a turnaround attributed to President Trump's annexation threats and tariff tactics. The Liberals secured more seats than the Conservatives, although it's unclear if they'll achieve a majority. Carney emphasized the end of Canada's traditional relationship with the U.S. and the need for self-reliance, capitalizing on voter concerns about Canadian sovereignty and economic stability. The election saw a record number of advance votes, with voters citing tariffs and affordability as key issues, while opponents portrayed Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have reached an agreement to add a criminal charge for individuals who wear masks while committing crimes. This additional charge applies to suspects facing a class A misdemeanor or more serious offenses, with a reduced penalty for separate crimes. The legislation, prompted by concerns over masked suspects during protests, aims to address individuals concealing their identity while committing crimes or fleeing the scene. The budget also includes measures for involuntary commitment of mentally ill individuals and banning student cell phone use during the school day.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video showing a band member seemingly calling for violence against Conservative politicians. The group rejects inciting violence and says footage was taken out of context, although counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution. The controversy has led to calls for Kneecap to be denied entry to the USA and Canada ahead of their North America tour, and for the group to be dropped from music festivals.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for policy changes to allow male health workers to perform mammograms to address critical staff shortages. Currently, only female staff can perform breast screening examinations. While some women express concerns about comfort and privacy, others, like breast cancer survivor Sally Reed, support the idea if it saves lives. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch believes most women would prefer female radiographers, emphasizing the need to recruit more women instead of compromising privacy.

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy substitutes. This move aims to tackle obesity by incentivizing manufacturers to reduce sugar content in these drinks. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the government now believes the health benefits don't outweigh the harms of excess sugar. The government is also proposing to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a shift towards authoritarianism, coupled with economic chaos and foreign policy missteps. His trade war has injected instability into the economy, and his foreign policy has alienated allies.

His administration has faced numerous lawsuits and accusations of undermining democratic institutions, with concerns raised about the erosion of civil liberties and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been characterized by significant shifts in US foreign policy, including strained alliances, tariff implementations, and an isolationist "America First" approach. Key foreign policy institutions are reportedly in crisis, and the US's standing on the global stage has been questioned by international leaders. Trump's actions have influenced elections, with the Canadian election resulting in a Liberal victory seen as a response to Trump's tariff war and territorial threats. The sudden cutoff of US military aid to Ukraine has also highlighted the administration's goals of pressuring Ukraine to accept a deal with the Kremlin.</p>

This comes as the US has imposed tariffs totaling 145 per cent on goods from China, with Beijing responding with increased duties on imports from the US.

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals have secured a comeback victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against Trump's threats and policies. Trump's influence became a defining issue, allowing Carney to position himself as a defender of Canadian sovereignty. The Conservatives made gains but fell short, and the election highlighted divisions within Canada. The left-wing New Democrats (NDP) collapsed, with leader Jagmeet Singh stepping down. Carney now faces major challenges, including uniting the country and navigating the trade war with the US.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank has reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit, driven by strong investment banking performance. Net profit attributable to shareholders reached 1.775 billion euros, a 39% increase year-on-year. However, the bank has increased its provision for credit losses to 471 million euros, citing uncertainties in the geopolitical and macro-economic outlook in the U.S. due to tariff policies. Despite this, CEO Christian Sewing stated that the results put the bank on track to meet its 2025 targets, marking the best quarterly profit in fourteen years.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to form Canada's next government, marking a historic turnaround amid threats from US President Donald Trump. However, the party has not secured a clear majority in parliament, meaning it may have to work to unite Canadians in the face of Trump's tariffs. Carney presented himself as the most experienced leader in a time of crisis, warning that Trump "is trying to break us, so America can own us." The close vote share between the Liberals and Conservatives indicates division in the country and a challenge for Carney as he looks to lead Canada through a trade war with the US.</p>

Spain’s national power company said early Tuesday that nearly all power had been restored in the country, mostly ending a major outage that affected airports, trains, traffic lights and other critical infrastructure. The company, Red Eléctrica, said that 99 percent of power demand in Peninsular Spain was being met, and that all substations on the grid were operational by 6 a.m. local time, nearly 18 hours after power was shut off on Monday.</p>

And long lines formed at A.T.M.s and grocery stores, where credit card readers stopped working. By Tuesday morning, the outages were mostly over, but their cause was still under investigation. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said that officials were still investigating the causes of the outage.</p>
