        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal trade court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, marking the first legal hurdle for this key economic policy. Five domestic businesses are arguing that Trump exceeded his power by enacting steep tariffs on over 180 countries, claiming the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't authorize such sweeping duties. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that IEEPA clearly empowers the president to impose them. The plaintiffs seek to block the executive order and claim damages for collected tariffs.</p>

          <p>Everton's women's team will move to Goodison Park, the club's former stadium, after plans to demolish the 132-year-old venue were cancelled.

With a capacity of nearly 40,000, Goodison Park will be the largest dedicated women's football stadium in the country.

          <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez has commenced after months of delays, potentially offering them a chance at freedom after nearly 30 years in prison. The brothers were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents and sentenced to life without parole. The hearing will focus on their rehabilitation in prison and whether they deserve a lesser sentence that would make them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. Prosecutors are arguing against resentencing, citing the brothers' lack of full responsibility for the crime.</p>

Witty will be replaced by Stephen Hemsley, who previously served as CEO from 2006 to 2017. The company's decision to withdraw its guidance is partly due to higher medical costs, which have also negatively impacted other insurance stocks. Witty's tenure was marked by government investigations, a cyberattack, and public scrutiny following the murder of a company executive.</p>
