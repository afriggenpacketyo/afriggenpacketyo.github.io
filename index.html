          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-30 03:42:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 56-year-old South Korean man is under investigation for potentially starting a wildfire while performing an ancestral rite near a family grave.  The fire, which burned over 48,000 hectares and killed 30 people, destroyed numerous structures and national treasures, including a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The suspect denies the charges, but his daughter reportedly stated he used a cigarette lighter to burn branches, potentially igniting the blaze. The BBC's reporting may slightly favor the prosecution's narrative, showcasing the damage and casualties without fully exploring alternative theories of the fire's origin.</p>
