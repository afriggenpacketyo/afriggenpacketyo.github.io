          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank would likely have implemented easier monetary policy, including interest rate cuts, if not for the Trump administration's tariffs. He explained that the tariffs forced inflation forecasts to rise, compelling the Fed to maintain its holding pattern with the key borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. Despite mounting pressure from the White House, Powell indicated that any future decisions on rate cuts would be strictly data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis, refusing to rule any specific timeline in or out.</p>

Musk heavily criticized the legislation, threatening to support primary challenges against Republicans who vote for it, which he claims would destroy American jobs. In response, Trump suggested that a government efficiency department, formerly led by Musk, should investigate the substantial federal subsidies Musk's companies receive, adding significant volatility to the electric vehicle company's shares.

Administration officials state the center, which could hold up to 5,000 people, is a key part of a plan to accelerate mass deportations. The facility's isolated and unforgiving location, surrounded by alligators and pythons, is being openly touted by officials as a natural deterrent against escape.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet led to significant spikes in U.S. consumer prices. Economists attribute this stability to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including aggressively pre-ordering inventory, absorbing initial cost increases to protect market share, and utilizing legal loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Experts caution, however, that these are temporary measures and that the inflationary impact of the tariffs is still likely to be felt in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

It traces the genre's evolution from a taboo subject to an established category where nonfiction often aims to demystify BDSM, while fiction delves into its complex psychology. Newell's book, set within San Francisco's sex industry, is lauded for its intelligent and emotionally perceptive examination of identity, loneliness, and the ambiguous space between performance and reality in transactional relationships.</p>

          <p>In a major development in the Lucy Letby case, police have arrested three former senior managers from the Countess of Chester Hospital on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The arrests are part of a corporate investigation into the hospital's decision-making and response when nurse Lucy Letby was murdering and attempting to murder babies between 2015 and 2016. This action occurs as Letby's conviction faces a formal review, with some medical experts publicly questioning the evidence that was used to secure it.</p>

The order came after the Supreme Court partially stayed a nationwide injunction, creating legal uncertainty and fear within immigrant communities. The judge specifically demanded to know if the government believes it can begin deporting U.S.-born children of non-citizens who are not plaintiffs in the current lawsuit, pressing for clarity on the immediate real-world consequences of the ruling.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance declared that the massive funding increase for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is the most crucial part of the Republican spending bill, dismissing other consequences as secondary. In a social media post, he stated that compared to the bill's immigration enforcement provisions, factors like the CBO score, Medicaid policy, and the national debt are all "immaterial."

Compounding this, a recent Supreme Court ruling empowers states to block Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, a decision that could shutter hundreds of clinics nationwide.
