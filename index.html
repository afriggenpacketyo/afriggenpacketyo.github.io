          <p>A small Vans RV-10 plane crashed into two homes in a Simi Valley neighborhood, resulting in the deaths of the pilot and a passenger, and a dog. The plane had departed from William J. Fox Airfield in Lancaster and was en route to Camarillo Airport. Residents inside the two single-family homes were safely evacuated without injuries, and the Ventura County Fire Department extinguished the fire. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash, focusing on the pilot, aircraft, and operating environment; a preliminary report is expected within 30 days, while the full report may take up to two years. This incident follows a similar crash in January where a Vans RV-10 crashed into a warehouse in Orange County.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of granting citizenship based on real estate investments, effectively banning the last 'golden passport' program in the EU. The court found that such policies undermine the solidarity and mutual trust between member states, treating nationality as a mere commercial transaction. Maltese Prime Minister Abela defended the program, noting it had generated significant revenue, but pledged to rework the system to align with the court's decision. While purchased passports are now ruled out, 'golden visas,' offering residence permits for major investments, remain an option in many EU countries, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks.</p>

Wong expressed gratitude for the mandate and emphasized that the results signal trust and stability to the international community amid global economic uncertainties. The election was dominated by concerns about the cost of living, jobs, and economic growth, with Wong previously warning of a potential recession in 2025 and forming a task force to address economic challenges.</p>

The vote tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, with most of the eligible voters believed to be Starbase workers. Musk celebrated the approval, noting it is now a real city. The creation of the city has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, including the potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches, while SpaceX says this authority would streamline launch operations.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased payroll taxes and new excise taxes as President William Ruto's government attempts to address the country's staggering foreign debt. These measures have significantly reduced the take-home pay for salaried workers, impacting their buying power, and have sparked discontent due to the lack of visible public services. Kenya's debt has risen to $80 billion, with nearly 60% of revenue being used to pay off loans. The country's economic struggles are compounded by high poverty and unemployment rates, with a large portion of the labor force working in jobs beyond the reach of tax collectors.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, signaling a potential disruption to Britain's traditional two-party system. The Conservative Party suffered substantial losses, while the Labour Party was also punished by voters, opening the door for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The surge in support for Reform, driven by Farage's campaigning, indicates a growing public disenchantment with the main parties. Political analysts suggest that this fragmentation could transform Reform into a major opposition force, challenging the dominance of Labour and the Conservatives.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is facing a deepening crisis amid a surge in recall petitions targeting its lawmakers and accusations of obstructing the Lai administration. Pro-Lai supporters have initiated recall campaigns against 35 KMT legislators, while local KMT officials have been arrested for allegedly forging documents in counter-recall efforts. The KMT and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) have faced criticism for allegedly weaponizing legislative tools to slash government budgets and expand parliamentary powers.

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam is causing widespread anxiety among factory workers and exporters, potentially destabilizing Vietnam's economic growth. The country has become increasingly dependent on demand from the United States, which contributed to over a quarter of its economy last year. Factory executives are exploring alternative markets and negotiating with American customers to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, but fear job losses. The Vietnamese government is seeking a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a resolution, hoping to avoid significant damage to its manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, while home-schooled students will receive $2,000 annually. Texas Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private education.

          <p>A survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships have chosen not to marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name upon marriage. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed. While the opposition party calls for the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, fearing it would affect traditional family values. Common-law couples lack the benefits of legal couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long fight for justice after the murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Catina was killed by her boyfriend, the family's struggle to keep him behind bars led to legislative changes, including allowing victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children are accompanied by a support person when testifying. Harriet Salarno founded Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws, while her daughter, Nina, became a prosecutor specializing in domestic violence cases. Despite their efforts, the family continues to attend parole hearings to ensure Catina's killer remains in prison.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, with 12,000 new coffee shops opening in the past year, driven by increased accessibility and price competition. This surge is occurring alongside an official push to promote domestic beans, with President Xi Jinping endorsing coffee from Yunnan province. While the market expands, Starbucks has seen its market share decline from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain traction. Much of the growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities, indicating a broader adoption of coffee culture beyond major urban centers.</p>

          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Japan, is limiting visitors to address overcrowding and protect its cultural heritage. The town, known for its Taisho-period architecture and resemblance to scenes from the animated film "Spirited Away," has faced challenges from overtourism, including traffic congestion and damage to the town's atmosphere. Admission restrictions, including shuttle buses and pre-purchased tickets, were implemented from December 2024 to February 2025, improving congestion. Officials are considering extending the visitor limits throughout the year to preserve the serenity of the hot spring resort.</p>

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has stationed 16 disciplinary inspection teams in various regions, including Shanxi province, where former governor Jin Xiangjun soon became the target of an investigation.
