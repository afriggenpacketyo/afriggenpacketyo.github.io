        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to deport Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to Liberia, a move his lawyers condemn as punitive and unconstitutional. Abrego Garcia was previously mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order, and his case has become a point of contention over immigration policy. The government filing asserts that Liberia is a safe and democratic country that has provided assurances of humane treatment. However, critics, including Senator Chris Van Hollen, argue the action is retaliatory and designed to prevent Abrego Garcia from exercising his due process rights in the U.S. while he faces pending legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in Women's World Cup history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs in a decisive victory over South Africa. The commanding performance caused South Africa to collapse to 97 all out, a total Australia easily chased to win by seven wickets with 199 balls remaining. This victory secures Australia's top spot in the group stage, setting up a semi-final clash with India. King's historic spell, which surpassed a 41-year-old record, underscores Australia's formidable and unbeaten run as they head into the tournament's knockout stages as clear favorites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, has stated that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is "the biggest line of bulls--- that’s ever been created." He argues that building a business from nothing requires an all-consuming level of hard work and dedication, leaving no room for such a balance. Liautaud, who grew his company from a single shop with a $25,000 loan into a brand with over 2,600 locations, emphasizes that success demands a relentless, 24/7 commitment. His perspective aligns with the work ethics of other notable entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Elon Musk during their companies' early days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A vibrant Pablo Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, sold for approximately $37 million at a Paris auction, exceeding expectations. The 1943 painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over eight decades. The artwork captures Maar at a painful closing stage of her relationship with Picasso, with experts noting the vividness of the colors and the raw emotion conveyed. The sale price represents the highest paid for any artwork at a French auction this year, highlighting the enduring global interest in Picasso's work.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he would seek China's help in ending the war in Ukraine, stating he plans to discuss the matter with President Xi Jinping. This diplomatic approach comes as Trump grows frustrated with Russia's lack of progress toward a ceasefire, despite his campaign promises for a quick resolution. The move is significant given China's status as Russia's key ally, which has supported Moscow economically since the imposition of Western sanctions. Trump's comments follow new U.S. sanctions on major Russian oil companies, signaling a shift in strategy as he looks for new avenues to pressure Moscow and bring the protracted conflict to a close.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices, arguing it fosters greater resilience and internal motivation. The former soccer star suggests that a parent's presence on the sidelines can cause children to become nervous or overly driven to impress, outsourcing their motivation rather than developing it themselves. By allowing kids to practice without supervision, they are free to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from their coaches and teammates independently. This approach, Wambach believes, helps cultivate self-starting traits that are crucial for becoming successful and well-adjusted adults both on and off the field.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks across Ukraine have resulted in at least four deaths and 20 injuries, with significant damage reported in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukrainian air defenses successfully intercepted most of the incoming projectiles, but the strikes still caused casualties and damaged buildings. In response, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his urgent plea for more Western air defense systems, specifically U.S. Patriot systems, to protect Ukrainian cities from such attacks. The assault underscores the ongoing intensity of the conflict and Ukraine's critical need for advanced military support to defend its population and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that over a third of Manhattan condo apartments resold in the last year were sold at a loss, reflecting a decade of stagnant prices in the market. While the rest of the country has seen significant home price appreciation, Manhattan's median price per square foot has remained flat since 2015, with factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration contributing to the weakness. The luxury segment, particularly properties over $10 million, has bucked this trend, continuing to see double-digit profits due to cash-rich buyers unaffected by interest rates. The data suggests that for many, Manhattan real estate has not been a profitable short-term investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques President Trump's sudden decision to demolish the historic 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to construct a new $300 million ballroom. The author argues the move, executed without prior submission of plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, exemplifies a presidency operating without regard for historical preservation, norms, or legal processes. The project is being funded by private donors, including major tech and defense corporations, which the article suggests raises concerns about influence and corruption.

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them remains high, fueled by true-crime entertainment and social media speculation. This article explores the cultural obsession, referencing recent unfounded rumors of serial killers in cities like Austin and Brooklyn. Experts attribute the real-world decline to factors like reduced hitchhiking, the advent of DNA technology, and increased public awareness. The analysis suggests that while society's monsters have evolved from serial killers to mass shooters, the macabre interest persists because figures like Ted Bundy, who kidnapped, committed sexual assault, and murdered, serve as a canvas for societal fears and projections.</p>

Major studios like Disney have invested heavily in AI but have yet to see significant cost savings or efficiencies, with some initiatives reportedly causing frustration. Key challenges include integrating new AI tools into established production workflows, navigating unclear copyright laws for AI-generated content, and gaining the cooperation of actors who fear being replaced. While AI is being used for tasks like animation and dubbing, it has not yet reached the quality or reliability needed to replace human creativity in major productions.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, an 80-year-old hand surgeon, undertook a remarkable journey to walk the entire 342-mile border of Los Angeles, a city he has lived in for half his life. Motivated by curiosity and a desire to truly know the city beyond a car windshield, he divided the trek into 34 segments. His adventure, detailed in his new book "Walking the Line," led him to historical landmarks, diverse neighborhoods, and unexpected cultural gems. Dr. Meals' prescription for others is to venture out on foot, stay curious and fit, and make the kind of life-enriching discoveries that can only be found by slowing down and observing one's surroundings.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the proliferation of prescription drug advertisements during major sporting events like the baseball postseason. The author humorously notes that the constant mention of side effects like rashes and joint pain can make a viewer feel symptomatic. The article explains that since a ban was lifted, pharmaceutical companies have invested heavily in sports programming to reach a captive, often older, audience. While the ads must legally state potential risks, their persuasive nature, showing happy people overcoming ailments, may drive consumer behavior in ways that are not purely informational, blurring the line between patient education and direct-to-consumer marketing.</p>

The activist investor is urging Fluor's management to consider separating or monetizing this stake, arguing that the core business is currently trading at a steep discount.

          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast are heading to the polls for a presidential election in which 83-year-old incumbent Alassane Ouattara is seeking a fourth term. Ouattara, a former IMF official, is campaigning on his record of economic growth and stability over nearly 15 years in power. The election has been marked by tension after two of his main rivals, Tidjane Thiam and former president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running, leading to protests and arrests. With four other candidates from smaller parties on the ballot, analysts give them little chance of unseating Ouattara, who remains the clear favorite to win.</p>

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital city of Tbilisi for attempting to illegally acquire two kilograms of uranium. The suspects allegedly planned to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material and transport it to China via Russia. According to authorities, the operation was coordinated from China, with one member already in Georgia organizing experts to search for uranium within the country. The security service released video footage of the detention, stating the individuals were apprehended while negotiating the details of the illicit transaction, though the exact date of the arrests was not specified.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) claims that left-wing terrorist plots outnumbered those from the far right in the first half of 2025. This article provides a nuanced analysis of the report, noting that many counterterrorism experts find the conclusion premature due to the small number of incidents and subjective data categorization. While the CSIS author acknowledges caveats, the piece highlights a broader debate on the challenges of tracking domestic terrorism and suggests the more significant finding might be the sharp decline in right-wing violence. It also explores the evolving nature of extremism, which is becoming more personal and less traditionally ideological.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China's dominance over the global supply of rare earth elements remains a critical vulnerability for Western economies. China controls nearly 70% of mining and 90% of processing for these metals, which are essential for high-tech goods, defense systems, and green energy. Recent Chinese export controls have heightened concerns about supply chain disruptions. Despite efforts by the U.S. and others to diversify, establishing new mining and, more importantly, processing facilities outside of China is a slow and difficult process. Challenges include high costs, strict environmental regulations, and China's significant technological lead in the complex refining process.</p>

Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a practical and accessible way to gain exposure to these assets without the typical drawbacks of direct investment, such as illiquidity and long lockup periods. This trend is particularly strong among younger investors, some of whom are expressing disillusionment with conventional markets. While alternatives can offer diversification, experts still recommend they constitute a smaller portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that traditional, long-term investing remains a proven strategy.

While the immediate crisis is averted, the president's social media posts suggest the reprieve is temporary, stating he will give the city a "shot" to handle its issues.

Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary to protect the state's fragile wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of aquatic vegetation and displace native waterfowl. Mute swans, originally introduced as ornamental birds, have proliferated and can significantly alter ecosystems. While conservation groups supported the bill, some animal advocacy organizations have condemned it as inhumane and an attempt by the hunting industry to add another target species.</p>

The state's 2016 Medicaid expansion has been a critical lifeline in high-poverty areas like East Carroll Parish, significantly reducing the uninsured rate.
