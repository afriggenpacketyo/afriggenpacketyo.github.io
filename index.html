          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs will continue deliberating after announcing it had reached a verdict on four of five counts but was deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. The judge has urged the jurors to continue their efforts to reach a unanimous decision on the complex charge, which carries a potential life sentence. This development occurred after two days of deliberations in the high-profile case, where Combs faces charges including sex trafficking and prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.

          <p>Intel's new chief executive is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for its contract manufacturing business, potentially shifting focus away from its 18A chipmaking process for external customers. The proposed strategy would concentrate resources on the next-generation 14A process, where Intel believes it can better compete with rivals like TSMC. This move is part of a broader effort to revive the company's fortunes after it lost its manufacturing edge and posted its first unprofitable year since 1986. The decision, which could involve a substantial financial write-off, is under review by the company's board. (not investment advice)</p>

This move reflects growing concerns in Taipei about a prolonged conflict with Beijing and underscores a strategic shift toward a "whole-of-society resilience" model.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has experienced a significant political setback after his government was forced into a U-turn on welfare reform, losing control of a key vote in the House of Commons. Despite holding a substantial majority, a large-scale rebellion from his own MPs led to a chaotic and humiliating climbdown on changes to the Personal Independence Payment. The episode has weakened the Prime Minister's authority and drawn comparisons to the parliamentary turmoil of previous, less stable governments. The event has left his administration appearing bruised and has raised questions about his leadership and policy direction.</p>

          <p>The Miccosukee tribe in Florida is actively opposing the construction of a new migrant detention facility, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," located near their homes in the Everglades. Tribal leaders have raised serious concerns about the facility's environmental impact on the Big Cypress National Preserve and the safety of their communities, with some villages located just 900 feet from its entrance. The detention center, which President Trump recently toured, is part of a broader, aggressive immigration enforcement strategy. The tribe argues that no environmental impact study was conducted and that the facility represents a step backward for Everglades protection.</p>

During his visit, Trump praised the facility's rapid construction and its secure location, stating the only way out is deportation.

For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. The current figures stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, which often exceeded 6,000 apprehensions per day.</p>

The bankruptcy filing converts the legal focus from individual justice in state court to a financial proceeding centered on the church's assets and ability to pay.</p>

          <h2>Invasive Argentine Tegu Lizard Spotted in California Park, Prompting Official Warning</h2>

          <p>Officials have issued a public warning after hikers discovered a large, invasive Argentine tegu lizard in a park near San JosÃ©, California. While the specific lizard was later captured, its presence raised alarms about the potential for this species to establish a breeding population. Argentine tegus, which can grow up to five feet long, pose a serious threat to native ecosystems by preying on the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds, snakes, and other local wildlife. The incident highlights the ongoing danger posed by invasive species, which are often introduced as escaped or released pets.</p>

          <p>Warner Music Group has announced another round of layoffs as part of a major restructuring plan aimed at reducing annual costs by approximately $300 million. In a memo to staff, CEO Robert Kyncl stated the move is necessary to "future-proof" the company by reallocating resources toward artist development, acquisitions, and technology. The plan includes $170 million in savings from headcount reductions and another $130 million from administrative and real estate expenses. This follows previous job cuts over the last two years as the company navigates a rapidly changing music industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Environmental Groups Denounce Newsom's Overhaul of California's CEQA Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:25:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Environmental organizations across California are expressing outrage over Governor Gavin Newsom's signing of two bills that significantly reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). A coalition of over 100 groups argues that the legislation represents an unprecedented rollback of essential environmental and community protections. They contend the changes, which exempt many housing and infrastructure projects from environmental review, were rushed through without public input. Critics fear the overhaul will harm vulnerable ecosystems and communities by allowing industrial development with insufficient oversight.</p>
