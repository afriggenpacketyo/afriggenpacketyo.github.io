          <p>Some parents are actively trying to delay their daughters' first period due to concerns about the trend of earlier menstruation and its potential health risks. These parents are focusing on dietary changes and reducing exposure to chemicals in personal care products. Experts suggest that it is reasonable to limit exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, but caution against overly restrictive diets that could lead to eating disorders. The article emphasizes the need for further research into environmental influences on puberty and policy changes to address the issue on a societal level. The tone of this article reflects a nuanced understanding of the topic and the varying perspectives on it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant global progress in combating child labor, sub-Saharan Africa continues to face substantial challenges with the highest number of underage workers. UNICEF and ILO's joint report reveals that there are 138 million child laborers worldwide, a decrease from 160 million in 2020 and 245.5 million in 2000. The report underscores that younger children aged 5 to 11 constitute the largest proportion of child laborers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty and limited access to quality education exacerbate the issue. The article calls for stronger enforcement of laws, increased labor inspections, and improved supply chain accountability to address the root causes of child labor. The article stresses that poverty at the household level, particularly in rural areas, needs to be addressed with appropriate political will and financing.</p>

          <p>Apple's latest software redesign, called Liquid Glass, has sparked controversy among users, who find the translucent backgrounds difficult to read. Apple Intelligence, the company's new AI initiative, has also been met with mixed reviews, with some features like AI-summarized notifications proving nonsensical. The delayed release of a revamped Siri, initially touted as a centerpiece of Apple Intelligence, has led to class-action lawsuits accusing Apple of false advertising. Despite these challenges, Apple executives are defending their decision to prioritize privacy and quality over rushing out AI features, emphasizing a long-term vision for AI integration. The piece suggests that Apple users who want a more AI-free experience can still enjoy their devices, as the company is not forcing these tools onto users.</p>

The company stated it bans "non-consensual intimate imagery" and has been working to detect and remove ads for nudify technology. Meta will share information about entities violating its policies with other tech companies to enhance child safety measures.

          <p>Recent polls show conflicting public opinion on President Trump's deportation policies, with one poll indicating approval and another disapproval. The numbers suggest that public opinion is unpredictable and open to being swayed. NPR's Domenico Montanaro notes that there's a difference between deporting hardened criminals and hardworking community members. The Trump administration plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, which the EPA argues are a small part of global emissions. This proposal has drawn criticism from environmental groups, who say the administration is propping up the coal industry.

          <p>The backlog in routine hospital treatments in England has decreased to its lowest level in two years, with the waiting list dropping to 7.39 million. The NHS has not met its target of seeing 92% of patients in 18 weeks for nine years, with the current rate just below 60%. The government has announced above-inflation rises for the NHS in the coming years to help meet this target. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting stated that the NHS is on the road to recovery, attributing the improvement to extra investment and reforms.

          <p>The increasing use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services is raising concerns about rising consumer debt, with credit card debt ballooning to over $1 trillion in the US. Consumer advocates warn that BNPL leads people to spend more and take on more debt than they can afford. A recent survey indicates that many BNPL users are turning to the service for necessities like groceries, and a significant percentage have had late payments. While BNPL companies claim to offer a healthier alternative to credit cards, experts caution about the ease of accumulating debt through multiple BNPL accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans found that pre-match rituals were more emotionally intense than the actual game for most fans. The study monitored heart rates and found that collective rituals like marching to the stadium and chanting were equivalent to scoring a goal. The author argues that watching football elicits a wide range of emotions and psychological states, and that researchers should ask fans what these moments mean to gain a deeper understanding. The author emphasizes the importance of football's collectivities and communitarian cultures in an increasingly individualistic world. The article offers a sociological perspective on the emotional connection fans have with football.</p>

          <p>A group of Jewish scholars argues that Harvard's efforts to combat antisemitism on campus perpetuate harmful stereotypes by assuming that being Jewish necessitates supporting Israel. They contend that Harvard's conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The scholars argue that Harvard's approach erases the diversity of Jewish thought and experience, harming Jewish students and faculty who don't conform to expected political views. They call on universities to stop policing the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy and start respecting Jewish agency.

          <p>Despite initial consternation, an Iran nuclear deal may be the least bad option for Israel, according to this analysis. While hard-line Israelis want complete dismantling of Iran's centrifuges, this is unlikely. A deal that draws in Gulf states could better integrate Iran into the region's economy, reducing its belligerence. Though some Israelis are skeptical, a diplomatic deal could curtail Iran's nuclear program and put it on a path defined by economic and pragmatic interests. The article suggests that a regional integrated Iran is less belligerent and that the population harbors very little hostility to Israel.</p>
