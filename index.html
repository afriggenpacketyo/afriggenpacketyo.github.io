          <h2>Solar Stocks Plummet Following Republican Tax Bill Passage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant downturn after House Republicans approved a tax bill eliminating key clean energy credits, impacting residential solar installers like Sunrun, whose stock plummeted by over 35% due to the bill's termination of tax credits for leasing equipment. Analysts from Jefferies and Guggenheim anticipate a disastrous outcome for companies heavily reliant on lease arrangements, with approximately 70% of the rooftop solar industry currently utilizing them. Enphase and SolarEdge also faced substantial declines as sales of their inverters are projected to decrease due to reduced demand for rooftop solar. First Solar was less affected because the manufacturing tax credit was relatively untouched. (not investment advice)</p>

Fairfax County Police assisted with traffic control, and the CIA spokesperson indicated that additional details would be released as appropriate.

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. The machine, which is larger than a double-decker bus, is made up of four modules manufactured in different countries and assembled in the Netherlands. Intel was the site of the world's first commercial installation of High NA in 2024, and only five of these machines have been shipped to date. High NA improves chip prices due to improvements in speed, performance and yield, and it is expected to be used by all of ASML's EUV customers, including Micron, SK Hynix and Rapidus.</p>

          <p>Millions of public sector workers, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises between 3.6% and 4.5% after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies that exceeded its initial budget of 2.8%.

The government has allocated additional funding to cover the cost of the pay rises, but schools will be required to fund the first 1% through improved productivity and smarter spending. The impact of these pay rises on inflation remains a key consideration.</p>

Bates has dismissed the book's narrative as distorted, while a former Biden staffer defended Bates's role and competence. The book also details instances where the White House successfully suppressed stories raising concerns about Biden's cognitive decline.</p>

The agency plans to require applicants to submit a copy of their residence certificate and is considering increasing the number of questions on the knowledge test. This decision follows several incidents, including a hit-and-run involving Chinese nationals and a wrong-way collision on an expressway involving a Peruvian national, both holding converted licenses.</p>

          <p>House Republicans passed a major tax and spending bill early Thursday morning. SALT is an acronym that stands for “state and local taxes” — it allows Americans to deduct some of what they pay, right now up to $10,000, in state and local taxes (like property taxes and sales taxes) from their federal taxes. Removing the SALT cap is seen as benefiting mostly wealthy earners in high-tax states like California or New York: people who might make $500,000 a year or $10 million a year and pay tens or hundreds of thousands in state and local taxes, the sort of people who don’t take the standard deduction.</p>
