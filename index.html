        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program are in jeopardy due to conflicting stances on uranium enrichment. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, rejected the U.S. proposal demanding Iran cease uranium enrichment, while President Trump insisted on this condition for any agreement. This disagreement has created uncertainty about the continuation of negotiations, with a possible meeting under discussion and Russia potentially playing a greater role. An Iranian official criticized the U.S.'s terms as unreasonable and highlighted a growing mistrust due to shifting positions, while Iran seeks sanctions relief. Optimism has waned on both sides, casting doubt on the future of the nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a proclamation restricting most international students from studying at Harvard University, citing concerns that the school is not a trustworthy steward of international student programs. The order alleges Harvard failed to report student disciplinary records and has ties to researchers in China. A Harvard spokesperson condemned the order as retaliatory and a violation of the school's First Amendment rights. The administration has repeatedly attempted to limit Harvard's ability to enroll international students, following disagreements over disciplinary practices and handling of pro-Palestinian protests, leading to funding cutoffs.</p>

The ruling was celebrated by environmental groups who seek public input and scrutiny regarding the pipeline's restart.</p>

          <p>The FDA will review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, at the request of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, following concerns fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Experts argue that the concerns are misguided, noting that some instances described as adverse events are normal occurrences during a medication abortion. Mifepristone has been used by millions of patients since its approval in 2000, and medication abortions account for over half of all abortions in the U.S.</p>
