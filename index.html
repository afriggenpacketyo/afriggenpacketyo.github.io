          <p>CVS Health surpassed Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter earnings and revenue, leading to a significant jump in its stock price. The company raised its adjusted profit outlook for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in technology and labor as key drivers of pharmacy efficiency, although growth was partially offset by a decline in the health services segment. The positive results come as the company continues a multiyear turnaround and cost-cutting plan under new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Copper Prices Fall After Trump's 50% Tariff Excludes Key Raw Materials</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 10:42:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's 50% tariff on copper imports surprisingly excluded raw materials like copper cathode, causing a record plunge in U.S. copper prices. The tariff, aimed at boosting domestic production, targets semi-finished products such as pipes, wires, and electrical components. Analysts note this pivot from market expectations has drastically narrowed the price gap between U.S. and global benchmarks. Despite the drop in raw material prices, experts predict that the cost of consumer goods like appliances and construction materials will still rise because manufacturers primarily use the tariffed semi-finished products.

          <p>A federal appeals court is examining the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The case challenges the president's authority, which a lower court previously ruled against before the decision was paused pending this appeal. Challengers, including several states and businesses, argue that the president has usurped Congress's constitutional power to set tariffs and that the IEEPA was not intended for this purpose. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national security threats and trade imbalances.</p>

          <p>Althorp House, the childhood home and final resting place of Princess Diana, will not be inherited by her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. According to royal experts and the tradition of primogeniture followed by the Spencer family, the estate will pass to Diana's brother's eldest son, Louis Spencer. The property has been in the Spencer family since 1508, and this line of succession ensures it remains with the same surname. While William and Harry can visit their mother's grave on the estate privately, the ownership and title will transfer to their cousin.</p>

The recall affects specific lots shipped to six states, and the FDA has warned of the risk of unintentional alcohol consumption.

          <p>An Irish court has dismissed MMA fighter Conor McGregor's appeal against a civil verdict that found he sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel in 2018. McGregor had been ordered to pay over £200,000 in damages after a jury sided with the accuser, Nikita Hand. His appeal argued that his "no comment" police interviews were improperly presented to the jury and that a question on the verdict form was poorly worded. The three-judge panel rejected these arguments, upholding the original decision and allowing the victim to "finally move on and try to heal."</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not view AI superintelligence as an imminent threat to the design software company. As Figma began trading on the NYSE, Field expressed skepticism that AI would quickly be able to replicate the company's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology, which is not readily available in public data sets. The comments come as other tech giants like Meta are heavily investing in the pursuit of superintelligence. Figma priced its IPO at $33 per share, valuing the company at over $19 billion.</p>

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, is set to completely close the heavily used 280-kilometer rail line between Berlin and Hamburg for at least nine months, starting August 1. The closure is part of a massive, multi-year project to overhaul Germany's dilapidated and outdated rail infrastructure, which has been plagued by decades of underinvestment. The Berlin-Hamburg route is one of the country's busiest, and its closure will necessitate long detours for passenger and freight trains and the deployment of 170 daily replacement buses. The project highlights the immense challenge Germany faces in modernizing its critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shares for Meta and Microsoft surged after both tech giants reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, with Microsoft surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization. A key theme from both reports was the massive and ongoing investment in artificial intelligence, with both companies planning to increase their multi-billion dollar capital expenditures on AI infrastructure. Analysts noted that this spending boom is likely to benefit chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom, who are key suppliers to the companies. The strong results and forward-looking investments signal the central role AI is now playing in the strategy and growth of major technology firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, even as it continued to lose broadband customers amid intense competition.

Growth was seen in its mobile division, which added a record 378,000 customers, and in its theme parks and film studio segments, while the Peacock streaming service saw its losses narrow significantly.

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif argues for the creation of a regional network for peaceful nuclear cooperation in the Middle East. He proposes an organization, tentatively named Menara, that would be open to all qualified states in the region who commit to rejecting nuclear weapons and accepting mutual verification. In return, the body would facilitate cooperation on peaceful nuclear technology for energy, medicine, and research. Zarif contends that this approach could build trust, enhance regional security, and reframe the nuclear debate away from conflict and towards shared solutions for development.</p>

Evidence included his online search history for poisons and a shipment of potassium cyanide to his dental office. The jury convicted him of first-degree murder, and the judge imposed the mandatory life sentence.</p>
