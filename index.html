          <p>Wildfires in Canada have forced approximately 17,000 residents in Manitoba to evacuate, with thousands more affected in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Manitoba declared a state of emergency, and resources to fight the fires are stretched thin, with officials fearing that some fires could grow and threaten communities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that tough choices are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes spending plans, particularly concerning health, defense, and education. The level of spending on health will determine whether cuts are made to "unprotected" areas, and increased defense spending could exacerbate the situation. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on not borrowing more money or raising taxes has led to speculation about spending cuts. The IFS suggests that the government has "front-loaded" its spending, leading to a slowdown in the future. The article conveys a sense of financial constraint and difficult decisions ahead for the UK government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New satellite images reveal that North Korea has deployed balloon-like objects alongside its damaged warship, which has been partially submerged since a failed launch. Experts suggest the balloons could be used to help right the ship or protect it from drone surveillance. The warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a malfunction during a launch, leading to significant damage.
