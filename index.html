          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using AI to craft "wrong number" text messages to trick users into revealing personal and financial information. These scammers validate active mobile numbers, build relationships, and ultimately aim to steal money through sophisticated scams, including 'pig butchering scams' which involve forging personal relationships. In 2024, consumers lost $470 million to scams originating from text messages, a five-fold increase since 2020, and AI is making it easier for criminals to target vulnerable individuals. Experts advise ignoring suspicious texts and marking them as spam to avoid becoming a target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a volatile trading day, ending a three-day relief rally as investors reacted to mixed signals regarding trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. While President Trump hinted at potential trade deals, the Chinese government denied active negotiations, though reports suggest China is easing tariffs on U.S. semiconductors. Several companies, including Intel, Eastman Chemical, and Skechers U.S.A., cited uncertainty stemming from global trade policies as a factor impacting their financial forecasts. Despite the market's volatility, a decline in Treasury yields and a rebound in the U.S. dollar provided some relief. (not investment advice)</p>

While the auto sector has seen a surge in sales, economists worry that sales could decline once tariff-free inventories are depleted. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by President Trump will disproportionately impact lower-income U.S. households compared to wealthier ones. The study shows that taxes for the poorest 20% of households could rise four times more than those in the top 1% due to tariffs. Economists expect consumers to bear at least some of the tax burden through higher prices, with lower-income families spending a larger share of their budget on food and clothing. A separate analysis also found that Trump's tariffs are a regressive policy, placing a greater financial strain on those at the bottom.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has exhausted its food stocks in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade that has restricted humanitarian aid deliveries. The agency warns that hot meals kitchens, which have been providing critical assistance, are expected to run out of food in the coming days. Malnutrition is worsening, and essential commodities are scarce. The WFP urges all parties to prioritize civilian needs and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately, noting that over 116,000 tonnes of food assistance are positioned at aid corridors.</p>

Thai Customs have implemented stricter screening measures, intercepting over 800 smugglers and seizing more than nine tonnes of cannabis.</p>

          <p>US consumer sentiment has experienced its largest drop since 1990, triggered by economic chaos caused by President Trump's trade war. The index of consumer sentiment fell by 32% since January, with expectations worsening across various demographic groups due to uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for rising inflation. Inflation expectations have also surged, reaching their highest level since 1981, indicating that consumers are skeptical about the effectiveness of Trump's tariffs.
