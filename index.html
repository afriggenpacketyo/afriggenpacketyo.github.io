          <p>President Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union until July 9, prompting renewed trade negotiations between the two entities. Officials from both sides express optimism about reaching a deal, with discussions already underway between E.U.â€™s trade commissioner and the U.S. commerce secretary. However, significant differences in priorities remain, as the U.S. seeks changes to Europe's consumption tax system and digital regulations, while the E.U. aims to reduce existing tariffs. Despite these challenges, both sides are preparing for the possibility of failed negotiations, with the E.U. refining lists of retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced rare criticism of President Putin regarding the attacks on Ukrainian cities, describing Putin's actions as "CRAZY." This criticism follows a weekend of intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities, including civilian targets. However, Trump has not linked these attacks to his decision to refrain from joining European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or providing additional arms to Ukraine. Experts note this pattern creates a strategic void where Trump expresses disapproval of Russia's violence but avoids making Putin pay a price for his actions.</p>

          <p>A century before Tesla, electric vehicles were popular but lost ground to cheaper, gasoline-powered cars. Now, electric vehicles face political and economic headwinds, as some seek to undercut their growth and impose new taxes. Concerns about charging infrastructure and range, similar to those in the 1920s, persist today. Jay Leno owns a restored 1909 Baker Electric, highlighting the historical relevance as the United States potentially repeats history regarding electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>Market analysts caution investors to prepare for ongoing volatility despite President Trump's delay in imposing tariffs on the European Union. The delay, pushing the rollout to July 9, offers a brief window for trade negotiations, but significant uncertainty remains. Experts suggest the six-week period may not be sufficient to resolve all detailed questions, and political will on the U.S. side will be crucial for reaching an agreement. If the U.S. imposes substantial tariffs, the EU may have no choice but to implement countermeasures.</p>

He described the swim as one of his most challenging due to the cold water, strong winds, and mental strain of being constantly aware of potential shark encounters. Pugh hopes to inspire a change in public perception and promote measures to protect sharks, which are killed at an unsustainable rate of nearly 100 million each year.</p>

Critics argue this move politicizes the court and undermines judicial independence, while experts note that existing laws already allow for the deportation of individuals posing security threats.

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has passed away at the age of 94. Rangel served as a congressman for over four decades, representing Harlem and advocating for economic development and social justice. Despite facing an ethics violation that led to his censure, Rangel remained a respected voice in Congress and a symbol of Harlem's Democratic old guard. His legacy includes his work on trade, Medicare, and empowerment zones, as well as his instrumental role in Hillary Clinton's entry into electoral politics.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country. This follows the administration's decision to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard, citing concerns over antisemitism and foreign student lists. Trump accused Harvard of being slow to respond to requests for information on foreign students, aiming to identify individuals who should not be allowed back into the country. The move has sparked debate, with supporters applauding the focus on vocational education and critics questioning the impact on scientific research at Harvard.</p>

While the lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera and did not affect residential areas, the eruptive plume posed a hazard due to ash and volcanic rock. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and tourists have been drawn to witness the spectacle.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities, taking advantage of the United States' reduced diplomatic involvement and military assistance. President Trump criticized Putin but did not indicate a willingness to provide Ukraine with additional support. With the U.S. pulling back, analysts say Russia sees an opportunity to press its advantage. As Ukraine faces shortages of interceptor missiles, Russian bombardments are becoming more deadly.</p>

          <p>An Israeli air strike on a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City resulted in the deaths of at least 54 Palestinians. The IDF stated it targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center in the area. Video footage showed fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of severely burned victims, including children. A senior Hamas official said the group agreed to a ceasefire proposal, but a U.S. envoy stated the proposal was unacceptable.</p>
