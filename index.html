          <p>Russell Martin has been dismissed as the head coach of Rangers FC following a tumultuous 17-game period marked by poor results and intense fan hostility. His final match, a draw against Falkirk, culminated in him needing a police escort to leave the stadium amidst supporter protests. The article details Martin's brief and chaotic era, comparing it unfavorably to his predecessors and highlighting a disconnect with the fanbase from the start. It also points to broader issues within the club's management, suggesting that problems at Ibrox extend beyond the manager's performance.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is planning a phased restart of its manufacturing operations, beginning with its engine factory, after a significant cyber-attack halted production for over a month. The shutdown has caused severe financial strain on the company and its vast network of suppliers, some of whom were forced to lay off staff. In response, the UK government has underwritten a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to support JLR's supply chain. While the resumption of operations is a positive step, experts warn that a full recovery will be a gradual and complex process for the automaker and its partners.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Public Dissatisfaction with Political Handling of Government Shutdown</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that most Americans, regardless of party affiliation, do not believe either the Republican or Democratic positions justify a government shutdown, primarily due to concerns about its economic impact. The poll shows negative approval ratings for President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans regarding their handling of the situation. While Democrats are often described as "weak," Republicans are labeled as "extreme," reflecting broad public discontent with the political landscape. This dissatisfaction is compounded by a feeling that the administration is not adequately focused on key issues like inflation.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, the victim of a mass sexual assault case in France, is returning to court to face one of her 51 convicted attackers who is appealing his sentence. The article explores the mixed impact of her case one year later, noting that while it has energized campaigns against sexual violence, systemic change within the French state has been slow. Some in her hometown wish to move on, viewing it as a private matter, yet many activists and victims feel her public stance has been a crucial moment. Despite a rise in reported cases, conviction rates remain stagnant, highlighting ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>During a speech celebrating the U.S. Navy's 250th anniversary, President Donald Trump reassured service members that they would receive all their pay despite the ongoing government shutdown. He blamed Democrats for the impasse and promised that troops' frozen paychecks would be fully compensated once a funding bill is passed, also reiterating his support for a 3.8% pay raise. The shutdown has halted pay for active-duty military personnel and furloughed many civilian Department of Defense employees. It has also scaled back crucial on-base family support programs, creating financial uncertainty for military families across the country.</p>

          <p>Journalist Lesley Stahl shares her experience of interviewing the actors from the mockumentary "This is Spinal Tap" for a segment on the film's sequel. Expecting to speak with actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, she was instead met by their in-character band personas, who engaged in spontaneous, improvisational comedy. Director Rob Reiner explained that both the original film and its sequel were created without a script, relying entirely on the cast's improvisational talent. The article highlights the unique, unscripted nature of the filmmaking process that made the original a cult classic and a pioneer of the mockumentary genre.</p>

          <p>A major theft of over $1 million worth of Santo Tequila, co-owned by Guy Fieri, has highlighted a growing and sophisticated form of cargo crime known as double brokering. Criminals created fake trucking companies online, intercepted the shipment, and redirected it from its intended Pennsylvania destination to Los Angeles using unsuspecting drivers. This high-tech method, which involves spoofing GPS data and fabricating communications, has seen a 1,200% spike in recent years, costing U.S. businesses hundreds of millions. Although a portion of the tequila was recovered by the LAPD, the incident reveals significant vulnerabilities in the modern supply chain.</p>

It follows the case of Jacob Thompson, who developed a severe form of epilepsy after a routine childhood vaccination and was awarded over $2 million. The program, funded by a tax on vaccines, operates as a "no-fault" court, shielding manufacturers from most lawsuits to ensure a stable vaccine supply. While it has paid out nearly $5 billion, critics, including HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., point to significant delays and a complex process.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing high-end AI chips, aiming to reduce its dependency on U.S. technology and challenge the market dominance of companies like Nvidia. Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Huawei have recently unveiled powerful new semiconductors, with some claiming to match the performance of Nvidia's chips designed for the Chinese market. This push is part of a broader national strategy to become a global tech leader, accelerated by ongoing trade tensions with the United States. While experts acknowledge China's rapid progress, they note that the U.S. still maintains an edge in the most advanced chip technology and established supply chains.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to drastically increase H-1B visa fees, policymakers in India are intensifying efforts to attract skilled Indian professionals back from the United States. The move is seen as an opportunity to reverse a decades-long brain drain, with some anecdotal evidence suggesting that a more hostile U.S. immigration environment is prompting expatriates to consider returning. Headhunters report a rise in inquiries from U.S.-based Indian professionals and students exploring opportunities in India's booming tech sector. However, experts caution that a large-scale reverse migration will require a more concerted government effort to create compelling incentives for relocation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal assets amid ongoing protests related to immigration enforcement. The move has been sharply criticized by state and local leaders, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called it an abuse of power and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The authorization came shortly after federal authorities reported a confrontation where an armed woman was shot. This action is part of a broader administration strategy of deploying troops to several Democrat-led cities, raising legal and constitutional questions about the use of military for domestic matters.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced a plan to overhaul the housing market, aiming to reduce costs for buyers, shorten transaction times, and decrease the number of failed sales. Under the proposed reforms, sellers would be legally required to provide key property information upfront, such as leasehold costs and the condition of the home, to increase transparency. The plan also considers introducing earlier binding contracts to prevent deals from collapsing late in the process, a common issue that costs the economy an estimated £1.5 billion annually. These changes are intended to make the home-buying experience less stressful and more efficient for families and first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>This sports analysis examines the tactical implications of Liverpool star Mohamed Salah's role, suggesting his limited defensive work is creating vulnerabilities, particularly against strong opponents. While Salah's positioning high up the pitch is key to his goal-scoring prowess, it often leaves the right-back exposed to a 2-on-1 disadvantage. The article argues that while this strategy is effective against teams Liverpool dominates, top-tier clubs are exploiting the space left behind him. The issue is not Salah's individual performance but the team's overall defensive structure, which needs to adapt to better cover for his advanced attacking role.</p>

Hassett stated that while the administration remains hopeful for a resolution, the threat of layoffs is a tactic to pressure intransigent Democratic senators by highlighting the shutdown's costs to their constituents. The shutdown, now in its fifth day, has created a stalemate, with both Republican and Democratic leaders expressing little optimism for a swift agreement.

He argues that art is not merely a reflection of politics but an active participant in public discourse, conveying widely understood ideas about authority and social relations. Powers uses the example of a recurring story about a Han dynasty prime minister, depicted in various art forms, to show how concepts of jurisdictional authority were broadly understood by the public.

The show is described as a display of sophisticated disco-pop, featuring precise choreography, strong vocals, and a sprawling live band. The article notes that while her latest album may not have produced the same chart-topping singles as its predecessor, the tour demonstrates her evolution into a serious live act focused on musicianship and long-term artistic integrity.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his intention to file a lawsuit against the White House to block the deployment of 300 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon. This move follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from federalizing and deploying the Oregon National Guard to the city. Newsom condemned the president's actions as an "abuse of the law and power" and an attack on the rule of law itself. The White House confirmed the deployment order, stating it was a lawful action to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland.</p>

By centering a major sketch on a niche but wildly popular streaming phenomenon, the show signaled its intent to engage with a broader and more digitally-native cultural landscape.
