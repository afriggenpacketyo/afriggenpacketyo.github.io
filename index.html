          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. He received a suspended 18-month sentence after making a comprehensive confession to preparing a serious act of violence and aiding a terrorist act abroad. Prosecutors detailed his social media contact with a young man in Austria who planned to use knives or explosives, with Mohammad A. providing bomb-building instructions and organizing contact with an Islamic State member. This conviction highlights the complex challenges of preventing international terror plots and the critical role of intelligence in protecting large public gatherings from such threats, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance against extremist influences.</p>

          <p>India's substantial merchandise exports to the U.S., valued at $434 billion, now face a challenging 50% tariff imposed by the Trump administration. These levies are a direct consequence of India's continued oil purchases from Russia, significantly threatening its economic outlook. Analysts from Capital Economics and Goldman Sachs predict a material impact, potentially reducing India's GDP growth to around 6% from a previously forecast 7%. Key sectors such as engineering goods, gems, jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. In response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is advocating for national self-reliance and considering tax reforms to bolster domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A pioneering US-China team, including researchers from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Columbia University, Technical University of Munich, and East China Normal University, has announced a significant scientific breakthrough. For the first time, they have efficiently converted difficult-to-degrade mixed plastic waste directly into petrol in a single step, operating at ambient temperature and pressure. The conversion process yields not only petrol components but also valuable chemical raw materials and hydrochloric acid. This innovation promises to support a circular economy by transforming diverse plastic waste into useful products for various industries, including water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and the broader petroleum sector.</p>

A key announcement confirmed Trey Lance as the backup quarterback to Justin Herbert, having outperformed veteran Taylor Heinicke. The team also made numerous cuts, including eight veterans, and placed several players on injured reserve, such as linebacker Junior Colson for the season. New running backs Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris are slated for heavy workloads in the team's run-oriented offense, as the Chargers aim to improve their postseason performance and shed previous labels.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott has expressed confidence that star pass rusher Micah Parsons will suit up for the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, despite an ongoing contract standoff. Parsons has been holding out from team practices throughout the summer, seeking a new long-term deal, a situation that owner Jerry Jones and Parsons' agent have publicly debated. Drawing on his own past contract experiences, Prescott believes Parsons will be ready to play and dismissed concerns about the dispute causing locker room distractions. However, cornerback Trevon Diggs showed less certainty, emphasizing the team's desire for Parsons to resolve his situation and join them on the field.</p>

The group, "No Azure for Apartheid," gained entry to President Brad Smith's office, delivering a court summons. Smith stated that while employee views are respected, trespassing and disrupting operations are unacceptable, leading to the removal of seven individuals, including two employees, who may face disciplinary action. Microsoft is investigating claims that its Azure software was used for surveillance of Palestinians, while affirming its commitment to ethical technology use and expressing concern for all victims of the conflict.</p>

The lawsuit asserts that despite white voters comprising only 40% of Texas's population, they control over 73% of congressional seats. This legal challenge follows a contentious debate in the Texas House, where Democrats accused Republicans of gerrymandering in violation of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is reportedly investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents pertaining to the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This inquiry stems from the alleged discovery of thousands of Russia-related documents in "burn bags" at FBI headquarters by Director Kash Patel. The investigation aligns with President Trump's long-standing claims that the Russia allegations were a "witch hunt" and a "hoax," with some administration officials accusing Obama-era intelligence leaders of potential wrongdoing. While no criminal charges have been filed, the probe intensifies the political scrutiny on the FBI's past actions.</p>

The recent haboob caused widespread disruption, leading to over 39,000 power outages, severely reduced visibility that grounded flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and prompting warnings for drivers to stay off roads.

          <p>An 85-year-old woman with dementia, Barbara Dee Crosby, who went missing in rural California, was successfully located thanks to her faithful tan Chihuahua mix, Poncho. After Crosby disappeared from a senior living home, a multi-agency search-and-rescue team, aided by public sightings of the dog, found Poncho under a clump of brush, which led them to Crosby asleep nearby. Due to the steep terrain and dense vegetation, rescuers had to extract Crosby using a specialized litter and rope system. However, in a bittersweet turn, Poncho ran off before he could be safely secured and is now missing, prompting authorities to seek public help to find the "unsung hero."</p>

          <p>A funeral director in Leeds, Amie Upton, has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries following a BBC investigation that revealed she kept babies' bodies at her home. One grieving mother, Zoe Ward, described her horror at finding her deceased son in a baby bouncer in Upton's living room, with another baby's body on the sofa. This distressing discovery highlights a critical issue within England and Wales' unregulated funeral industry, where there are no legal requirements for body storage or qualifications for directors. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust had previously received "several serious concerns" about Upton's services, leading to her ban and police investigations, though no crimes were ultimately identified.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has reached settlements with a group of current and former FBI agents who had accused the bureau of politicization during the Biden administration. Empower Oversight, a group founded by former Republican Senate staff, announced resolutions for 10 cases, including eight recent settlements. These cases involved agents disciplined for expressing personal and political views, such as those concerning the January 6 Capitol riot and COVID-19 vaccine mandates, or for disputes over investigation approaches. As a result, three agents are being reinstated, others are permitted to retire, and some will receive back pay and benefits. These agreements occur amid other internal FBI leadership changes and concerns raised by the FBI Agents Association regarding due process.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has voiced skepticism that President Trump's recent efforts, including an investigation into furniture imports and potential tariffs, will effectively revive domestic furniture manufacturing in the U.S. Cramer contends that the industry's long-standing reliance on cheaper import supply chains has led to a depletion of the skilled workforce, making a return to previous production levels improbable. He cited major retailers like Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma as examples of companies heavily dependent on foreign sourcing, suggesting that tariffs would more likely result in increased consumer prices than a manufacturing boom. Cramer also questioned the national security justification for furniture tariffs, contrasting them with more critical sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical article humorously delves into the hypothetical idea that a new Melania Trump magazine cover could finally satisfy Donald Trump's perceived deep-seated need for cultural validation. Through a series of absurd, time-traveling vignettes featuring a "vortex" that shouts demands for Trump's recognition, the piece critiques his relentless pursuit of accolades, awards, and media attention. It exaggerates his desire for everything from an Oscar to a Nobel Peace Prize, suggesting that this insatiable craving for approval is a driving force behind his political actions. The narrative playfully posits that fulfilling this need might even prevent future political turmoil.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households are facing a projected slight rise in gas and electricity prices this autumn and winter, as the regulator Ofgem prepares to announce its latest price cap. Analysts anticipate an approximate 1% annual increase, which means average family energy bills will remain significantly higher than a few years ago. This expected rise is partly influenced by additional government support measures, such as an expanded £150 Warm Home Discount, which will be collectively funded by all billpayers. Campaigners express concern about another winter of high energy costs and growing household debt, advising consumers to explore fixed-price deals while carefully considering potential exit fees.

          <p>President Donald Trump has generated significant controversy by announcing his intention to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications. Cook, the first African-American woman to serve on the Fed Board with a term extending until 2038, has vehemently denied the claims and vowed to sue, arguing that the president lacks the legal authority for such a removal. This action intensifies Trump's sustained pressure campaign on the Fed to reduce interest rates and challenges the central bank's historical political independence. While initial market reactions were muted, this unprecedented move could have profound long-term implications for U.S. economic policy and the Federal Open Market Committee's composition.

          <p>This analytical article posits that Donald Trump's persistent use of falsehoods is systematically eroding the credibility of government institutions, potentially leading to widespread public disbelief. It argues that this "fire hose of falsehoods" fosters nihilism, making it difficult for people to discern truth and engage in political discourse. The article references recent controversies, such as the FBI raid on John Bolton's home and the firing of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, as instances where Trump's actions and rhetoric have injected doubt into legitimate government functions. The piece concludes that this chronic dishonesty risks backfiring, making it challenging for any administration to communicate vital information, from national security to public safety warnings, to a deeply skeptical populace.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national wrongly deported and recently rearrested, have filed an emergency motion to reopen his immigration case, seeking asylum in the United States. Garcia was initially deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March, despite a 2019 court order barring his removal due to fear of persecution, after the Trump administration alleged he was an MS-13 gang member. His lawyers argue that his re-entry makes him eligible for asylum and that he faces persecution in Uganda, where he might be sent, or back in El Salvador. They accuse the government of "vindictive and selective prosecution" and attempting to coerce a guilty plea.</p>
