          <p>A Cameroonian-flagged tanker carrying liquefied petroleum gas has caught fire in the Gulf of Aden, prompting the crew to abandon the vessel. One mariner is reported missing, while authorities investigate the cause, with conflicting reports suggesting either a projectile strike or an accident. The incident occurs amidst ongoing Houthi rebel attacks on shipping in the region, though no group has claimed responsibility for this event. The vessel, previously identified as part of an Iranian "ghost fleet," poses a risk of explosion.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked manager Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making him the shortest-serving permanent manager in Premier League history. The decision followed an eighth consecutive game without a win, culminating in a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea. The article details the challenges Postecoglou faced, including a squad struggling to adapt to his high-pressing style and underlying issues at the club involving summer transfers and management clashes. The club is now seeking its third manager of the season.</p>

          <p>Gaza's civil defense agency reports that an Israeli tank shell struck a bus in Gaza City, killing eleven people from the same family. The family was reportedly attempting to inspect their home in the Zeitoun neighborhood during the ongoing ceasefire. The Israeli military stated its forces fired on a "suspicious vehicle" that approached their troops, posing a perceived threat. This incident marks the deadliest single event involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the ceasefire began eight days ago.</p>

The 80-year-old political figure, who died on Wednesday, was a dominant force in Kenyan politics for decades. Due to safety concerns, a planned road procession was canceled.</p>

Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with more specific criteria to narrow the competition.

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper and is engaging with the company's management. The move comes after KDP's stock fell 25% following the announcement of a controversial merger with coffee company JDE Peet's, a deal that investors worry is structured unfavorably for KDP shareholders. The article suggests Starboard may seek to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this transition, potentially by gaining board representation. This strategy would be similar to its successful engagement with Ritchie Bros Auctioneers, where Starboard's involvement helped double the company's stock price after a similarly unpopular merger.

          <p>A grassroots organization in Missouri, "People Not Politicians," is gathering signatures to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot to overturn the state's newly enacted gerrymandered congressional map. The Republican-drawn map, signed into law last month, is designed to make the state's congressional delegation more heavily Republican by targeting a Democratic seat in Kansas City. The effort is facing legal challenges from the state's top Republican election officials, who question the validity of the petition process. If successful, the referendum would allow Missouri voters to decide directly whether to keep or reject the politically drawn districts.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible to promote better mental health and future success. To prepare for their eventual introduction, she recommends two key actions starting around age 10: educating them about responsible online behavior and setting firm rules. Parents should discuss topics like privacy, the permanence of online content, and the value of time spent offline. When a device is introduced, Twenge suggests implementing clear boundaries, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight and using parental controls to manage usage and block inappropriate content.</p>

He launched the company from his Bronx apartment in 2014 with $50,000 of his own money, personally testing prototypes in a supermarket's walk-in freezer. The brand, which combines Italian tailoring with warm linings, has found a niche among financiers, politicians, and billionaires, and has been profitable for seven of the last eight years.

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection rule requires airlines to input either 'M' or 'F' for a passenger's sex, disregarding the 'X' gender marker available on U.S. passports since 2022. This policy has caused significant concern and confusion among non-binary and transgender travelers, who fear they may face difficulties or be denied boarding on international flights. While federal courts have affirmed the validity of 'X' marker passports, the new airline reporting requirement creates a discrepancy that could lead to invasive scrutiny by border agents.

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment strategy, Warren Buffett outlines three main categories of assets and clarifies why he avoids non-productive ones like gold. He argues that currency-denominated investments are a bet on government stability, while assets like gold produce nothing and rely solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for them in the future. Buffett's preferred category is productive assets, such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on the output they can generate over time. He emphasizes that the success of these investments is measured by their actual performance, not by fluctuating daily market prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Polling data reveals a growing gender divide, with Gen Z men skewing more conservative.
