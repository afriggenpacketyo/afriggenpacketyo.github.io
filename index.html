          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that if the U.S. continues to impose AI semiconductor restrictions on China, Huawei will capitalize on its position in the Chinese market. While acknowledging that Nvidia's technology is currently ahead of Huawei's, Huang cautioned that Huawei could meet China's needs and potentially expand its reach globally if the U.S. chooses not to participate in the Chinese market. This statement was made during the Viva Technology conference in Paris, highlighting the potential shift in the AI semiconductor landscape due to geopolitical factors.</p>

          <p>The UN nuclear watchdog, IAEA, has criticized Iran for failing to comply with its non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such condemnation in two decades. The agency's 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution, drafted by the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, with 19 votes in favor. The resolution highlights Iran's repeated failures since 2019 to provide full cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple locations, constituting a breach of its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency.</p>

          <p>The struggling budget retail chain Poundland has been sold for a nominal Â£1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers, with plans for a proposed restructure to be put before the High Court. This restructuring could potentially involve a significant number of store closures as the chain has struggled to compete with other discount retailers, experiencing a decline in sales earlier this year. Pepco Group, the previous owner, decided to auction off the brand after sales slumped and employer National Insurance contributions increased financial pressure. The business will continue to operate under the Poundland brand in the UK and Dealz in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland.</p>

The mayor blamed the demonstrations on President Trump's immigration policies, while state officials have insisted local law enforcement has the situation under control.

Citing efforts by Russia, Ukraine, and the US, the PLA Daily argues that massed deployment of unmanned systems has become a "consensus" in military modernization.

          <p>The recent protests in Los Angeles, triggered by immigration raids, underscore the tension between state power and public compliance, as well as the importance of hope in the face of oppression. While authoritarian rulers may use protests as an excuse for displays of force, failing to protest can lead to moral corruption and hopelessness. The protests against the raids, which targeted individuals posing no danger, aim to protect neighbors and colleagues from arrest. The situation recalls Hannah Arendt's argument that the state creates tinderbox situations when it has lost the expectation of public compliance.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is advocating for the manufacturing of advanced chips in France, positioning the country as a critical tech hub in Europe. Macron's comments come as European tech companies reassess their reliance on foreign firms for crucial technology and infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France, highlighting the country's historical role in chipmaking. Macron aims for France to manufacture semiconductors in the 2nm to 10nm range and touted a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France.</p>

          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) in the UK has warned that some Jolly Rancher sweets are unsafe to eat due to the presence of chemical compounds, mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH).
