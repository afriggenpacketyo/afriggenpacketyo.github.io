        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior United Nations official has expressed deep alarm over reports that Israel is planning a full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, warning the UN Security Council of potentially catastrophic outcomes. Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenča stated that such an expansion of military operations would endanger millions of Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The proposed plan, which reportedly faces opposition from Israeli military leaders, is seen by some as a negotiation tactic following the breakdown of ceasefire talks. The UN continues to call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and unimpeded humanitarian aid into Gaza, where famine is reportedly unfolding.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed a draft law that would tighten regulations on medical treatments for gender transition for individuals under 18. The legislation, supported by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, aims to protect minors' health by requiring that medications like puberty blockers be dispensed only after approval from a national ethics committee. The law also mandates the creation of a national registry to monitor the use of these medicines and track the medical histories of those undergoing treatment. Transgender rights advocates have protested the measure, which now awaits parliamentary approval, where the governing coalition holds a strong majority.</p>

          <p>The National Football League and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire several of the league's media properties, including the NFL Network and NFL Fantasy. As part of the deal, the NFL would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, which is preparing to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service. The agreement would see the NFL Network integrated into ESPN's platform, while ESPN would also gain distribution rights for the RedZone channel. The deal, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, is seen as a strategic move to enhance ESPN's content offerings and further the NFL's revenue goals.</p>

The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares, with existing investor Thrive Capital possibly leading the round. This valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation in March, reflecting strong growth as its flagship product, ChatGPT, approaches 700 million weekly active users. The company's annual recurring revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion by the end of the year, underscoring its dominant position in the generative AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is encountering a significant rocket shortage as it attempts to build a massive satellite internet network, Guo Wang, to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The national project has recently accelerated its launch schedule, using three state-owned Long March rockets in a single week, indicating a prioritization of its resources. This has left other ambitious projects, like Shanghai's Qianfan constellation, struggling for launch capacity and turning to private rocket companies. Qianfan recently issued a tender for seven launches to deploy 94 satellites, highlighting the growing domestic competition for limited launch vehicles as China pursues its space ambitions.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony, holding a moment of silence at the exact time the bomb was dropped in 1945. Survivors, officials, and international representatives gathered at the peace memorial park to lay flowers and call for a world without nuclear weapons. Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing acceptance of nuclear deterrence amid global conflicts, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated Japan's mission to lead disarmament efforts. The event serves as a powerful reminder of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear warfare, with global leaders urging reflection and de-escalation in a time of rising tensions.</p>

          <p>A former staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Edward Coristine, was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump to threaten federal intervention. According to police, Coristine was attacked by a group of teenagers, and two 15-year-olds were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking. The incident prompted Trump to post on social media about the city's crime rate being "totally out of control" and to state he would consider federalizing the city if conditions do not improve. The U.S. Attorney for D.C. echoed the need for a tougher stance on juvenile crime in response to the event.</p>

Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout, where dozens of Democrats fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The governor's petition argues that Wu and the other absent lawmakers have abandoned their official duties, justifying their removal and potentially constituting bribery. Wu responded that denying a quorum was a fulfillment of his constitutional oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map," setting up a major legal and political confrontation over legislative power.</p>

A quarter of those polled were undecided or would not vote Republican, signaling a potential challenge for the GOP, which is counting on sustained Latino support.

The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs approximately 1,200 staff, who the state will attempt to reassign. The closure reflects a broader trend driven by criminal justice reforms and falling crime rates, with advocates hoping the savings will be reinvested into community-based safety and prevention programs.

          <p>Lebanon's government has directed its army to create a plan to ensure that only state institutions possess weapons by the end of the year, a move aimed at disarming the powerful militant group Hezbollah. The decision follows significant U.S. pressure and is part of implementing a ceasefire agreement from November 2024 intended to end hostilities with Israel. Hezbollah, the only faction to retain its arms after the country's civil war, has stated it will not disarm while facing Israeli attacks. This sets the stage for a tense internal confrontation over the control of arms and national security in Lebanon.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter financial results that missed analyst expectations on earnings but exceeded revenue estimates, causing its stock to slide in after-hours trading. The company's overall sales grew 32% year-over-year to $7.69 billion, driven by strong performance in its Client and Gaming segment. However, its AI business revenue declined due to U.S. export restrictions to China, which impacted gross margins. AMD provided an optimistic sales forecast for the current quarter but noted its outlook does not include revenue from its China-focused AI chip, as license applications are still under review.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program and redirected its funding without congressional authority. The judge found that the transfer could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas that rely on the program for mitigation projects. The injunction temporarily halts the repurposing of the funds while the court further considers the states' legal challenge.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the facility the "Speedway Slammer," echoing the naming of a controversial Florida facility.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was recently convicted on prostitution-related charges, has reportedly been in contact with Donald Trump's team regarding a potential presidential pardon. A source close to the rapper's legal team confirmed the outreach to NBC News. Combs was denied bail and is awaiting sentencing in October, where he could face a significant prison term. In a recent interview, President Trump acknowledged that he had been approached about the matter but seemed hesitant, noting that Combs had been "very hostile" towards him politically, which he said makes a pardon more difficult to consider.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known colloquially as "Stratus" or XFG, is spreading in the United States and has become the third most prevalent strain. The variant, a combination of two other subvariants, accounted for 14% of U.S. cases in late June, up from nearly zero in March. The World Health Organization has placed XFG on its watchlist but assessed its global public health risk as "low," advising that current vaccines should remain effective against severe disease. While there is no evidence of more severe illness, common symptoms are consistent with previous Omicron variants, including cough, sore throat, and fatigue.</p>

Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a record 18.6% one-year drop in motor vehicle thefts.

The ordinance, aimed at protecting vulnerable tenants from the health dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but will not be enforced until January 2027 to give landlords time to comply. Officials are encouraging the use of passive cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains over air conditioning.

Investigators stated that Rush, who was killed in the implosion along with four passengers, would likely have faced criminal charges had he survived.

          <p>Following a federal court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been instructed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, but a federal appeals court ruled that the government cannot disregard laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens access to certain humanitarian protections, though not necessarily asylum itself, and halts a key measure the administration credited for a steep drop in illegal border crossings. The Justice Department may still appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
