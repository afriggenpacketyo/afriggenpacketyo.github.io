          <p>Turkish President Erdogan's advisors are developing new regulations to address significant food waste, particularly from all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts. The Waste Prevention Foundation of Turkey reports 8.7 million tons of food are discarded annually, with individuals wasting 102 kilograms each year, a substantial amount for a country facing economic challenges. Proposed changes include allowing guests to customize breakfast packages from available items and encouraging à la carte dining to reduce waste. This initiative aims to conserve raw materials, energy, and labor, with the breakfast buffet now being framed as a matter of national security.</p>

          <p>Kira Chathli, a 26-year-old county player, has emerged as a leading batter in The Hundred women's competition, overcoming her initial unsold status in the draft. Signed by London Spirit as a replacement, she has delivered 160 runs at an impressive strike-rate in six matches, a significant personal achievement for the former Surrey player. Chathli attributes her improved performance to dedicated strength and conditioning, which has allowed her to hit the ball harder and trust her timing, alongside her naturally fearless approach. Her journey, including a background in rock-climbing and a chemistry degree, highlights a blend of physical and mental prowess contributing to her success on the biggest stage.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a new congressional map, strongly supported by former President Donald Trump, designed to secure up to five additional Republican-leaning districts in the state. This strategic move aims to bolster the GOP's chances of maintaining a majority in the U.S. House in upcoming midterm elections, reflecting a national effort to redraw political boundaries. The passage followed weeks of intense Democratic opposition, including a walkout to deny quorum, with Democrats alleging the map is illegal and racially discriminatory. Republicans, however, assert the plan improves their political performance and ensures more competitive districts.</p>

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous U.S. states, are engaged in a significant political battle over congressional redistricting, poised to impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. After Texas passed a measure creating five new Republican-leaning seats, California lawmakers responded by redrawing their own maps to boost Democratic representation by five seats, which will go before voters in November. This unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, spurred by former President Trump, highlights the practice of gerrymandering and its legal complexities. Critics argue the process allows politicians to pick voters, with potential lawsuits over diluting minority voting power.</p>

          <p>At 30, self-made billionaire Lucy Guo maintains an intense daily routine, waking at 5:30 a.m. for back-to-back gym sessions and often eating during meetings to maximize productivity. Guo, co-founder of Scale AI and founder of Passes, advocates for cutting out "wasted time" like doom-scrolling, even suggesting that China's "996" work culture offers sufficient work-life balance. Her extreme approach, however, faces criticism from some founders who argue against the "fetishization of overwork" and its impact on employee retention. Additionally, Guo's latest venture, Passes, is embroiled in a class action lawsuit regarding content, which she dismisses as a "shakedown."</p>

          <p>Chinese defense researchers have developed a groundbreaking data link system for hypersonic combat, achieving time synchronization accuracy within five nanoseconds, significantly surpassing NATO's Link 16 by two orders of magnitude. This innovation, from the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, enables real-time, secure coordination between hypersonic platforms, ground command centers, radar networks, naval fleets, and satellite intelligence. Experts suggest this could mark a strategic shift in military power, potentially leaving Western militaries "time blind" and unable to react to coordinated hypersonic swarms. The system addresses critical challenges in high-speed warfare, where even small timing errors translate to kilometer-level targeting miscalculations.</p>

Connolly claims she was made "Sir Keir Starmer's political prisoner" and plans to meet with members of Donald Trump's administration to discuss free speech, an issue raised by the US State Department concerning UK restrictions. While expressing regret for her tweet, she finds it "bizarre" that her actions led to imprisonment.</p>

Scientists monitor the magma flow and ground changes to predict activity, noting this is the fourth time in 200 years Kilauea has exhibited such repeated fountain episodes.

Pyongyang's Vice Chief of the People's Army's General Staff, Ko Jong Chol, stated the incident risks driving the situation to an "uncontrollable phase," linking it to ongoing summertime US-South Korean military drills.

The judge deemed the administration's executive orders and related actions an unconstitutional "coercive threat," emphasizing that federal judges cannot reallocate political power.

Rookie Alex Freeland hit his first career home run, but the Padres' strategic play, including three sacrifice bunts, and effective pitching from Yu Darvish secured their victory.

          <p>Former Fresno County Superior Court Judge Adolfo Corona, 66, faces additional federal charges for allegedly sexually assaulting two court employees and attempting to obstruct the investigations into these crimes. The indictment details a March 2024 assault in a stairwell and a December 2023 incident where an employee was found unconscious in his chambers. Prosecutors allege Corona lied to the FBI and tried to persuade a dealership employee to falsify records to support an alibi. Previously indicted for sexual battery, Corona retired before the initial charges and now faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted, reflecting a serious breach of public trust.</p>

          <p>A new European study highlights that air pollution from oil and gas activities disproportionately affects Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities in the U.S., causing an estimated 91,000 premature deaths annually. The research, published in Science Advances, quantifies severe health effects like preterm births and childhood asthma across the entire oil and gas life cycle, from extraction to combustion. California ranks among the most affected states, with Los Angeles County bearing a significant burden. The disparities are linked to historical zoning practices like redlining, underscoring a critical environmental injustice and public health crisis that demands urgent attention.</p>

          <p>A convicted sexual assaulter, John Williams, 32, admitted to spray-painting swastikas on public and private property in downtown Ventura and then posting photos online in an effort to sow fear. Williams, who was on parole for forcible sexual assault, initially documented the vandalism as if committed by others, creating a false narrative. He pleaded guilty to three felony counts of vandalism, three felony hate crime counts, and a misdemeanor stun gun possession charge. This incident highlights a disturbing rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. and the deliberate spread of hate symbols, contributing to societal fear and intolerance.</p>
