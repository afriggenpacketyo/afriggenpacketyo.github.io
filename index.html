          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has returned to social media after a three-week silence following the mixed reception of her American Eagle ad campaign. The campaign, which used the tagline "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," drew criticism from some who perceived racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Despite the controversy, reputation management experts suggest the increased attention could benefit her career financially and lead to more opportunities, drawing parallels to past provocative ad campaigns that ultimately boosted celebrity profiles.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged a firearm at a vehicle during a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino after the driver allegedly refused to exit and struck two officers. The driver later contacted police, claiming masked men had shot at him, unaware they were federal agents. The incident has sparked controversy, with the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice calling it an "abuse of power," while a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson criticized local police for initially releasing the man, citing California's sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant famous for its celebrity clientele and old-school charm, has died at 90 in Belgrade, Serbia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has been called off as trade relations between the two nations continue to sour. The cancellation comes as the U.S. imposes significant tariffs on Indian exports, including a 25% duty as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil, bringing the cumulative rate to 50%. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, highlighting that the U.S. and EU also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. remains India's largest single export partner, making the escalating tensions a significant economic concern. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, briefly reaching Category 5 status before weakening to a Category 4 storm. While lashing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with heavy rain, the hurricane is forecast to remain a major storm as it moves northwest. The majority of meteorological models predict Erin will stay well off the U.S. East Coast, but it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents from August 20th to 27th. Coastal erosion is a significant concern, particularly for North Carolina's Outer Banks.</p>

        </div>

          <p>The United States and its key European allies, including France and Italy, are at odds over the future of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), whose mandate is up for renewal. The Trump administration initially sought to end the mission, viewing it as ineffective, but has since agreed to a one-year extension followed by a wind-down period after lobbying from European partners. European nations argue that a premature withdrawal would create a security vacuum that Hezbollah could exploit. The disagreement highlights another point of friction in transatlantic relations.</p>

          <h2>Decades-Old "85% Rule" for Setting U.S. Road Speed Limits Faces Re-evaluation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 00:00:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85% rule," which sets speed limits based on the speed of the 15th fastest car out of 100, is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This method often leads to a feedback loop where speeding drivers cause speed limits to be raised. Amid a spike in road deaths, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that communities should also consider factors like pedestrian risk and crash frequency. Cities like Madison, Wisconsin, are now lowering residential speed limits to improve safety, challenging the traditional car-centric approach.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method to make biological tissues, including brains, transparent, allowing for unprecedentedly clear 3D imaging of their internal structures. The technique creates what is described as an "ionic glassy tissue" that preserves the original morphology of the organ while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. This process also allows the tissues to be stored long-term at low temperatures as a glassy solid, maintaining their structural integrity for future study and providing a vivid view of their inner workings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 6-0 victory over the San Diego Padres, reclaiming sole possession of first place in the NL West. The Dodgers' win was significantly aided by the Padres' sloppy play, which included three runners being thrown out while attempting to steal in the first two innings. San Diego's starting pitcher struggled with control, issuing multiple walks, and a costly error by center fielder Jackson Merrill allowed two runs to score. The victory clinched the head-to-head season series for the Dodgers, which would serve as a tiebreaker if needed.</p>

          <p>A proposed Chinese design for a hypersonic drone carrier incorporates a novel "scissor wing" concept, featuring a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft approaches transonic and hypersonic speeds, it pivots to align parallel with the body. This dynamic adjustment allows the aircraft to mitigate shock waves and wave drag while maintaining lift across different speed regimes. At Mach 5, the entire vehicle functions as a "waverider," optimizing performance for extreme speeds.</p>

This proposal would represent a significant territorial loss for Ukraine, which has spent years and lost tens of thousands of lives defending the very areas it would be asked to surrender.</p>

          <p>A new, highly contagious "Stratus" variant of COVID-19 is driving a surge in cases across the United States, with the Southwest region reporting the nation's highest positivity rate at 12.5%. The spike coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., that removed the recommendation for healthy children to receive updated COVID shots. Public health experts have criticized this decision, pointing to data showing that boosters significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death from the virus.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic-era fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party space and is now on the market for £3 million. Purchased in 2017 for £555,000 by a former software CEO, the historic building underwent a challenging five-year renovation to become habitable, now featuring 40 beds and its own nightclub. The project involved overcoming significant logistical hurdles, such as having no running water or electricity and needing to cut through 16 feet of rock, to restore the once-abandoned island into a unique, off-grid destination.</p>

          <p>As UK families face the financial strain of feeding children at home during the six-week summer holidays, parents are sharing creative tips to cope with rising food prices. Strategies include meticulously planning meals, freezing discounted "yellow sticker" meat and other items, and batch cooking to make food last longer. Some parents portion out snacks into daily bags and store them out of reach to prevent them from disappearing too quickly. These efforts are crucial as many households struggle with increased costs for rent and childcare, making the loss of subsidized school meals a significant burden.</p>

          <h2>U.S. State Department Halts Medical Visas for Gaza Children Following Far-Right Online Campaign</h2>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly stopped issuing visitor visas for critically ill children from Gaza seeking medical treatment, following an online pressure campaign by far-right activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had shared videos of injured Palestinian children arriving in the U.S., falsely describing them as "Islamic invaders" and demanding the program be shut down. The decision was met with immediate condemnation from humanitarian groups like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, which called the move "dangerous and inhumane," as it cuts off a vital lifeline for children in a territory with collapsed medical infrastructure.</p>
