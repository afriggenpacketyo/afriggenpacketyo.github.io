          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision limiting the ability of federal district judges to impose nationwide injunctions against executive branch actions. The ruling came in a case challenging President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, granting the administration a partial victory. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship policy itself, it significantly curbed a key tool used to block presidential orders. The decision allows the administration to proceed with its policy in jurisdictions not covered by specific, narrower court orders.</p>

He argues that historical downturns for the company have consistently presented strong buying opportunities for long-term investors. Citing faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and Apple's projected 14% earnings growth, Cramer suggests the stock's value should be considered in the context of its growth potential. He believes there is a price point at which the stock becomes too cheap to ignore. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal authorities have arrested over 2,700 alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) since President Trump took office. The announcement came during a White House briefing, where Bondi emphasized that violent criminal immigrants are a top priority for deportation. The Trump administration has designated TdA as a terrorist organization, a move that facilitates the expedited removal of its members under the Alien Enemies Act. Bondi credited the administration's policies for making the country safer from such violent criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>Australia defeated the West Indies by a commanding 159 runs in the first Test match, largely due to a remarkable bowling performance from Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies team collapsed in the final session of the third day, losing all ten of their wickets and falling well short of the 301-run victory target. Hazlewood was the chief destroyer, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the hosts' batting lineup. Despite some resistance from Justin Greaves and Shamar Joseph, Australia's ruthless display secured the win with two full days to spare.</p>

The game involves two unarmed participants running directly at each other at full speed for a forceful collision. While organizers insist on safety protocols and describe it as a "game of skill," neuroscientists and others warn of the high risk of concussion and long-term brain injury, calling it the "commercializing of concussion."

The shipwreck, discovered in 2022, lies at a depth of about 525 feet, requiring a complex technical dive in complete darkness. The team had only nine minutes at the wreck site to survey and film its condition, noting scattered coal but no visible personal artifacts.

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a significant and dangerous expansion of presidential authority. By curtailing the power of lower court judges to block executive orders, the ruling effectively gives the president more leeway to implement policies that may violate the constitution, according to the author. The opinion piece suggests that rights will now be inconsistently applied across the country, dependent on local litigation. It frames the decision as a politically motivated move that threatens the rule of law and fundamental checks on executive power.</p>

This new wave of fiscal hawks is voicing opposition to President Trump's proposed tax cuts, arguing they are not accompanied by sufficient spending reductions. The dynamic mirrors past clashes within the GOP, but this time the dissenters are opposing a president who remains highly popular with the party's base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Haitian nationals, effective in early September. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits for an estimated 348,187 Haitians who have been living in the U.S., many since the 2010 earthquake. The administration argues that conditions in Haiti have improved enough for their safe return, a conclusion that contrasts with the State Department's own travel advisories. Those affected will become eligible for deportation if they cannot secure another form of legal status.</p>

          <p>A Honduran asylum-seeker is suing the Trump administration after she and her two children, including a six-year-old son with leukemia, were arrested by immigration agents at a Los Angeles court hearing. The lawsuit alleges the family's arrest is part of a nationwide campaign of unconstitutional "courthouse arrests" targeting non-citizens attending their required legal proceedings. The family has been held in a Texas detention facility for weeks, where the mother fears her son is not receiving adequate medical care. The suit demands their immediate release, arguing their detention is illegitimate and harmful.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the signing of a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, aimed at ending a conflict that has plagued the region for nearly three decades. The conflict in eastern DRC, involving a militia allegedly backed by Rwanda, has caused millions of deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis. Trump celebrated the deal as a "glorious triumph for the cause of peace" and stated the U.S. would apply pressure to ensure compliance. The agreement also reportedly allows for U.S. access to the DRC's significant mineral deposits.</p>
