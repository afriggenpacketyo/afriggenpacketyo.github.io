          <p>A powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has resulted in over 1,400 deaths and more than 3,100 injuries. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the remote, mountainous terrain, with entire villages flattened and many people still trapped under rubble. The United Nations and local health officials are urgently calling for international aid, highlighting the desperate need for food, medical supplies, and helicopter support to reach the affected communities. The disaster exacerbates an existing humanitarian crisis in the country, which has faced significant cuts in international funding since the Taliban's takeover in 2021.</p>

The retrospective, hosted by museums in Essen and Dresden, showcases his extensive body of work, including his famous charcoal drawings, animated films, sculptures, and tapestries. Kentridge's art frequently explores themes of colonialism, social power, and the legacy of apartheid in his home country. The exhibition provides a comprehensive look at his artistic development, from his early works dissecting the apartheid regime to recent multimedia installations that examine the fragile relationship between art and power.</p>

          <p>An international coalition of more than 85 climate experts has released a detailed review criticizing a recent Department of Energy report on greenhouse gases, labeling it as "not scientifically credible." The experts argue the Trump administration's report misrepresents scientific literature and cherry-picks data to downplay the economic damage of climate change. This independent review is the latest effort by scientists to counter what they describe as a politically motivated document designed to create doubt and support the fossil fuel industry. The controversy highlights a broader trend of political interference in the scientific process within federal agencies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Japan's Ministry of Defense reported that a Chinese Navy Type 052D guided-missile destroyer and a replenishment ship were observed passing near Miyako island in Okinawa prefecture. The vessels navigated through the waters between Okinawa and Miyakojima before heading into the East China Sea. Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force monitored the Chinese ships using escort vessels and patrol aircraft. According to Japanese officials, these same ships had been conducting maneuvers that effectively circled the Japanese archipelago for over a month, signaling an increased and assertive Chinese naval presence in the region.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the benefit of locking in high rates for a fixed term. While national average CD yields for one-year terms are around 2.04% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for shorter terms. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like exploring online banks and laddering CDs of various term lengths to maximize earnings in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to utilize the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket, which could be accessible to more people due to new deductions in 2025. This bracket allows individuals with taxable income below certain thresholds—$48,350 for single filers and $96,700 for married couples—to sell appreciated assets without paying taxes on the profits. The strategy, known as "tax-gain harvesting," can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings.

While industry insiders note that additive-free tequila made from 100% agave may be better tolerated by some, health experts caution against viewing any alcohol as a health drink. Experts emphasize that ethanol is the primary cause of hangovers, regardless of the beverage's purity, and that alcohol consumption negatively impacts athletic performance, sleep, and muscle recovery.

This spike has fueled expectations that the Labour government may need to implement tax increases to adhere to its self-imposed fiscal rules amid growing concerns about the state of public finances.

          <p>McDonald's has announced the expansion of its value offerings by bringing back its Extra Value Meals, a move aimed at attracting diners affected by economic pressures. The fast-food giant and its competitors have been using discounts to combat shrinking customer traffic, particularly among low-income consumers. The new combo meals, which offer a 15% savings compared to buying items separately, are designed to appeal to the half of McDonald's customer base not currently using the mobile app for deals. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted the significant pressure on lower and middle-income consumers, highlighting the importance of affordability in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Russia and China have signed a binding agreement to construct the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, significantly deepening their energy and economic ties. The deal will allow Russia's state-owned Gazprom to supply an additional 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China annually for 30 years. This move is a strategic pivot for Russia, which is seeking new markets after its gas exports to Europe collapsed following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions. The agreement is viewed as a clear signal of a strengthening alliance between Moscow and Beijing, challenging the Western-led economic order.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the former deputy leader, has been elected as the new leader of the Green Party in the UK. Campaigning on a platform of "eco-populism," Polanski has pledged to make the party bolder and more radical in its political approach. In his victory speech, he positioned the Greens as a home for those feeling politically hopeless and set a goal of winning at least 30 parliamentary seats in the next election. While open to collaborating with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on specific initiatives, Polanski ruled out a coalition with Keir Starmer's Labour Party, which he accused of abandoning its promises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, a decision that could force the government to refund billions of dollars. The prospect of repaying this revenue has raised concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation, contributing to the rise in bond yields, with the 30-year yield topping 4.98%. The court determined that only Congress has the constitutional power to implement such sweeping levies, though the tariffs remain in place pending a likely appeal to the Supreme Court. This development adds another layer of uncertainty to the bond market and federal budget outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Arkansas has ruled in favor of over 37,000 plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against State Farm, finding that the insurer systematically underpaid claims for "totaled" vehicles. The lawsuit alleged that the company's valuation software improperly factored in a hypothetical "haggling discount" that customers might negotiate with used car dealers, resulting in lower payouts. The lead plaintiff was found to have been underpaid by about $600 on her vehicle. State Farm, which no longer uses the same valuation program, is facing similar legal challenges in other states, highlighting a broader issue of how insurers calculate replacement costs for total-loss vehicles.</p>

          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a significant resurgence in the luxury vehicle market, driven by strong sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). The General Motors brand has seen 12 consecutive quarters of sales growth, with EVs now accounting for about a third of its recent sales, far outpacing the industry average. Notably, nearly 80% of Cadillac's new customers are trading in vehicles from competing German luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. This shift suggests that Cadillac's focus on electrification is successfully helping it recapture prestige and market share that it had lost to foreign rivals over the past several decades.</p>

Human rights advocates and former DHS officials have raised serious concerns, warning that a rapid, large-scale hiring push could lead to increased misconduct and abuse, echoing problems from a similar expansion in the 2000s.

The market is also experiencing a "flight to quality," with high demand for new and modern office buildings, causing their availability rate to tighten significantly.
