          <p>A 30-year-old man, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, has been charged with multiple counts of second-degree murder after a car-ramming attack at a street festival in Vancouver that left 11 dead and dozens injured. The incident occurred at the annual Lapu Lapu festival, which celebrates Filipino culture. While investigators have ruled out terrorism as a motive, they cite the suspect's history of mental health issues. The Filipino community is grieving, and the city is calling it the "darkest day" in Vancouver's history.</p>

          <p>The US military reports hitting over 800 targets in Yemen since March 15, claiming to have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders. The Houthis, who control large parts of Yemen, reported that recent US strikes on Sanaa resulted in at least eight deaths, including women and children. The US maintains that its actions are aimed at stopping Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which the Houthis claim are in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to hinder the wind energy sector, the industry is experiencing a 'repowering' phase, replacing aging turbines with newer, more efficient models. This repowering activity provides opportunities for companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. While the growth of new wind farms has slowed, the repowering of existing sites offers economic benefits and increased electricity output, though public opposition and permitting processes remain challenges.</p>

          <p>While some major technology companies are pausing data center projects, the AI data center market remains strong overall. Analysts suggest this "pause" reflects a strategic reallocation of resources rather than a decline in demand, with companies focusing on projects that currently make the most sense. Power, fiber, water, and land scarcity are driving the reshuffling. Long-term enterprise adoption will continue to drive AI and data center demand.</p>
