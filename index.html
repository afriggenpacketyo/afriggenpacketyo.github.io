          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed the Trump administration is considering acquiring equity stakes in major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, following a recent 10% acquisition of Intel stock. This move aims to exert greater government control over the private economy to achieve economic and national security goals. Critics, including some conservatives, argue this policy deviates from free-market principles and could lead to politically rather than commercially driven decisions for companies. The discussion signals a significant shift in the government's approach to its relationship with key industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to purchase wireless spectrum licenses for approximately $23 billion. This acquisition will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets. The deal is also a critical step for EchoStar in resolving Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. Both companies anticipate regulatory approval by mid-2026, with AT&T's CEO calling it a "win all the way around." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is grappling with systemic issues, including an aging fleet, pilot shortages, and delayed defense deals, leading to its lowest-ever fighter squadron strength of 29, well below the sanctioned 42. With the retirement of MiG-21 jets, India's aerial capacity is significantly outmatched by China and comparable to Pakistan. Despite a push for indigenous manufacturing, such as the Tejas Mark 1A, deliveries are slow, and experts warn new aircraft may be outdated upon induction. The government recently approved a $7.2 billion deal for 97 Tejas fighters, but the overall modernization effort faces planning and execution hurdles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered an 8,500-year-old Stone Age settlement submerged 26 feet below the Bay of Aarhus, Denmark, part of a $15.5 million EU-funded project. This rare find provides a unique glimpse into coastal life during the Mesolithic period, when rapidly rising sea levels forced human populations inland. The oxygen-free environment preserved artifacts like animal bones, stone tools, and worked wood, offering a "time capsule" for researchers. The study uses dendrochronology to precisely date coastal forest submergence, offering insights into past societal adaptations to climate change, a relevant context for today's rising sea levels.</p>

          <p>Over 100 U.S. human rights and civil rights organizations are urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to secure the release of Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim, a 16-year-old American-Palestinian citizen imprisoned by Israel for six months over alleged rock throwing. The coalition highlights Ibrahim's deteriorating health and the alleged abusive conditions at Ofer prison, where he is held. They argue his detention violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, as he was transferred from occupied territory. This organized campaign marks an escalation in efforts to address what advocates describe as inadequate U.S. government response to the detention of Palestinian-American individuals.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates currently provide returns exceeding the inflation rate, making them an attractive option for savers. These safe investments are typically FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000 and allow individuals to lock in high rates for a fixed term. National average rates for 1-year CDs are 2.02% APY, but top online banks offer significantly higher yields, with some 6-month CDs reaching 4.45% APY. The current inverted yield curve means short-term CDs often offer better rates than longer terms, suggesting a laddering strategy for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage unveiled a plan to address illegal migration by detaining and deporting all arrivals, aiming for 600,000 deportations over five years. The party proposes building new removal centers and offering £2,500 for voluntary returns. A key component is the Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill, which would mandate removals, ban re-entry, and "disapply" international treaties like the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. This controversial strategy faces significant legal and political challenges, with opposition parties branding it unworkable and a rehash of existing ideas.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial, helping patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes lose an average of 10.5% of their weight. This promising result paves the way for global approval, potentially offering a needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 injections. The drug also significantly lowered hemoglobin A1c levels, with most patients no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While side effects were mainly mild gastrointestinal issues, the pill's convenience, lack of dietary restrictions, and potential for expanded access are highlighted as key differentiators in the lucrative market.</p>

          <p>Germany's automobile industry has shed approximately 51,500 jobs in the past year, representing 6.7% of its workforce and nearly half of all industrial job losses. This accelerating trend, with 112,000 jobs lost since 2019, is attributed to declining turnover, particularly from reduced exports to the U.S. (due to Trump's tariffs) and a sharp 14% dip in exports to China. Chinese domestic production of electric cars is also increasing, further impacting German manufacturers. Major firms are implementing cost-cutting programs, leading to layoffs and a challenging job market for young engineers, signaling an ongoing difficult period for the sector.</p>

The company's chairman acknowledged a stable but challenging economic environment in China, with lingering pressures from external factors and lackluster domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The author asserts that Brussels has accepted President Donald Trump's terms, effectively becoming an enforcer of America's China policy by agreeing to implement US export controls and investment screening within its own jurisdiction. This "subordination" eliminates the transatlantic divisions Beijing once exploited, codifying American long-arm jurisdiction and severing China's access to Western capital, technology, and markets, marking a significant geopolitical realignment.</p>
