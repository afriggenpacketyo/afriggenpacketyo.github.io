          <p>Recently circulated images of China's J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the advanced aircraft may debut at an upcoming military parade. The photos reveal a prototype with modified engine air intakes, which are believed to enhance both stealth capabilities and aerodynamic performance. These design changes are optimized for the new, more powerful WS-15 engines, indicating a significant upgrade in the fighter's technology. The potential public unveiling would mark a major milestone for China's military modernization program.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" following a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, confirming that no progress was made toward ending the war in Ukraine. The call, which the Kremlin noted lasted nearly an hour, occurred after the White House announced a halt to some U.S. weapon shipments to Ukraine due to concerns over dwindling domestic stockpiles. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the ongoing conflict and Russia's continued assaults, which have hindered his goal of achieving a ceasefire. He is scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy next.</p>

          <p>Beijing has issued a stern warning to New Delhi, urging India to cease using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs. A foreign ministry spokeswoman emphasized the "high sensitivity" of matters concerning Tibet and described the 14th Dalai Lama as having an "anti-China and separatist nature." The comments came in response to a statement from an Indian minister regarding the Dalai Lama's succession. China called on India to honor its commitments, exercise caution, and avoid actions that could undermine the improvement of bilateral relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent passage of a major budget bill, which includes a $5 trillion increase to the federal debt ceiling, is fueling concerns about the long-term stability of the U.S. dollar. Analysts suggest this significant expansion of government borrowing could accelerate a pre-existing trend of global investors diversifying away from U.S. dollar assets. The legislation allows the Treasury to accrue more debt to meet future obligations, raising questions about the country's fiscal health and the dollar's status as a reliable safe-haven currency.

          <p>One year after a landslide election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is struggling with plummeting popularity amid economic challenges. Key promises to boost growth have not materialized, with business optimism and productivity remaining low while high inflation and borrowing costs strain household finances. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a difficult fiscal situation, leading to speculation about potential tax hikes in the upcoming Autumn Budget.

Experts warn these cuts could force states to abandon Medicaid expansion, potentially leaving 17 million people uninsured by 2034. States like North Carolina, which recently expanded Medicaid, have "trigger laws" that could automatically end the program, jeopardizing coverage for over 650,000 residents. The cuts also threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals, many of which are already at risk of closure. (not investment advice)</p>

The practice of spreading sludge as agricultural fertilizer, known as "biosolids," is highlighted as a key pathway for re-polluting water and inserting toxins into the food supply.

This concept ignited a fierce culture war, drawing opposition from historians concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history and the park's proximity to the Manassas battlefield.

          <p>An analysis of the Club World Cup's group stage and last-16 reveals mixed results for the tournament. While official attendance averaged a solid 35,000 per game, this only utilized 51% of the large stadiums' capacities, with weekday and evening games struggling the most. Oppressive heat was a major factor, with an average heat index of 85°F and some games played in "very uncomfortable" or "oppressive" conditions. On the field, data supports the perception of strong performances from South American teams, who earned a win or draw in 77% of their matches against other confederations.</p>

          <p>The Pakistani military announced it has killed more than 30 militants in the North Waziristan district bordering Afghanistan over the past three days. The militants were reportedly members of the Pakistani Taliban or affiliated groups. This operation follows a recent suicide bombing in the same region that killed 16 Pakistani soldiers. Violence in Pakistan's border regions has surged since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of allowing militants to operate from its territory, a claim the Afghan Taliban denies.</p>

          <p>A major archaeological discovery in China's Yunnan province has unearthed dozens of wooden artifacts dating back 300,000 years, providing the first strong evidence of a sophisticated 'Wood Age' in East Asia. The study, published in the journal Science, details the findings from the Gantangqing site, which challenge previous assumptions about early hominid tool use in the region. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of such tools has been scarce. This world-class discovery fills a significant gap in understanding the technological capabilities of ancient human relatives in the Palaeolithic era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's recent legal settlement with Paramount constitutes extortion, not a legitimate legal victory. Paramount agreed to a $16 million payment to Trump's future presidential library to settle a lawsuit over a CBS interview, a suit the article deems frivolous. The payment came after the incoming FCC chair, a Trump appointee, warned that approval of Paramount's pending $8 billion merger could depend on resolving Trump's complaint. The author suggests this is part of a systematic pattern of shakedowns against corporations with business before Trump-appointed regulatory agencies.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which created a bright orange glow and a loud bang, was observed by dozens of people in the Scottish Highlands and captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the space rock, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, traveled through the atmosphere before pieces likely scattered over a wide area. Hillwalkers are being asked to look out for the meteorites, though finding them will be challenging.</p>

          <p>A commentary from a Canadian perspective argues that the world is being forced to seek independence from the United States due to its increasing unreliability and retreat from the global order it built.

This shift requires former allies like Canada to forge new partnerships and strengthen their own security and economic systems to navigate a post-American world.
