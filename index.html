          <p>The grandfather of Antoine Massey, an inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail, is pleading for his grandson to turn himself in, expressing concern for his safety and the potential for a violent confrontation with law enforcement. Massey, who faces charges including kidnapping and sexual assault, is one of two inmates still at large after ten escaped by exploiting a faulty cell door and scaling a barbed wire fence. The grandfather emphasizes Massey's good heart and urges him to consider his family, including his two children. Authorities have increased the reward for his capture to $50,000, and several individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escape. The man's hope is for his grandson to surrender peacefully and show love for his family.</p>

          <p>The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, has endorsed efforts to overturn the Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage. This move is driven by the denomination's conservative Christian base, which is emboldened by the recent success in overturning Roe v. Wade. The decision reflects the ongoing cultural and political battles surrounding LGBTQ+ rights in the country. The denomination hopes that this endorsement will lead to further legal challenges and ultimately a reversal of the current law.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his administration officials have warned that the deployment of military forces to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement could be the first of many such actions across the country. Trump stated that the administration will strictly enforce its deportation policies and will not tolerate violent protests against ICE officers. He also suggested he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act to suppress what he described as an "insurrection" in Los Angeles, although he provided no evidence to support his claims that protesters are "paid insurrectionists." The president's actions have drawn criticism from California's leaders and Democratic governors, who view it as a breach of state sovereignty and a provocative escalation.</p>

Zuckerberg is frustrated with Meta's current standing in AI and aims to leverage Wang's expertise to improve the company's Llama AI models. By taking a stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta avoids further antitrust scrutiny. Wang will lead a new AI research lab at Meta, bringing some of his colleagues with him, and will help Meta gain collective intelligence on how to build a better ChatGPT.</p>

          <p>One year before the 2026 World Cup, questions are being raised about England's progress under head coach Thomas Tuchel, following an embarrassing defeat to Senegal. Critics point to a lack of discernible plan, identity, and improvement since Gareth Southgate stepped down after Euro 2024. Despite making numerous changes to the lineup, Tuchel's team delivered a dismal performance, leading to hostility from fans. The defeat to Senegal has raised concerns about England's prospects for the upcoming World Cup, as the team's performance has been far from promising.</p>

          <p>A second night of serious disorder has erupted in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks thrown at police. Police responded by firing baton rounds and deploying water cannon, as well as riot dogs. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some linking it to tensions arising from the "oversubscription of migrants" in the area, while others have accused those making such claims of insincerity.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting or increasing production of vehicles currently manufactured in Mexico to American facilities. This decision comes amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration on imported vehicles and auto parts from Mexico. GM will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox to U.S. plants and convert an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks. The investment is expected to create jobs in the U.S. and align with Trump's policies on automotive tariffs.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is preparing to unveil a spending review, outlining how much money the NHS, schools, police, and other public services will receive over the next few years. The chancellor will emphasize plans to invest in Britain's renewal by spending an extra Â£113 billion on infrastructure projects. However, some government departments are likely to face real-terms cuts as the chancellor prioritizes health and defense budgets. The plans will cover day-to-day spending for the next three years and investment budgets for the next four, extending up to the next general election. (not investment advice)</p>
