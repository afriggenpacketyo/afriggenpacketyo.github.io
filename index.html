          <p>Catherine Connolly has been decisively elected as Ireland's 10th president, securing a historic landslide victory with 63% of the first-preference votes. As an independent candidate backed by major left-wing parties, she pledged to serve as an inclusive president for all, advocating for peace, neutrality, and addressing the existential threat of climate change. Her triumph, which was officially declared at Dublin Castle, represents a clear mandate from the people and a significant moment in Irish politics, as she prepares to take office on November 11. The outcome was celebrated by Sinn Féin as a victory for the combined opposition, underscoring Connolly's independent mind and her vision for the country's future.</p>

          <p>Independent Cranford Township Committee candidate Will Thilly created a bizarre spectacle at a local meeting, dressing in martial arts gear and performing flying kicks through protest signs. The theatrics, which included singing "Eye of the Tiger," targeted issues like "Unfair Taxes," "Closing Our Pools," "Overdevelopment," and "Divisiveness." Thilly used this unconventional platform to accuse Mayor Terrence Curran of mishandling a controversial 30-year tax-exemption deal for an apartment complex, alleging it contributed to rising property taxes and loss of revenue. This article notes Thilly's history of viral stunts, including breakdancing, as he continues to challenge local policies with highly visible, attention-grabbing methods.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Valencia, Spain, demanding regional leader Carlos Mazon's resignation a year after floods killed 229 people. Demonstrators criticized Mazon's administration for a delayed alert, issued over 12 hours after the national weather agency's highest warning for torrential rains. With banners reading "Mazon to prison" and chants of "They didn't die, they were murdered," public anger is high over the handling of Europe's worst flood-related disaster since 1967. A judicial investigation into the emergency response is currently underway, highlighting ongoing demands for accountability.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks in Ukraine killed at least four people and wounded 20, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew urgent pleas for more Western air defense systems. Kyiv experienced ballistic missile strikes, causing two deaths and 13 injuries, while the Dnipropetrovsk region reported two fatalities and seven wounded, with damage to residential buildings. Zelenskyy emphasized the critical need for additional U.S. Patriot systems to protect cities from such ongoing "horror," urging America, Europe, and G7 countries to ensure these attacks no longer threaten lives. This article underscores the severe human cost of the ongoing conflict and the urgent need for international support.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump departed for his first Asia trip this term, aiming to secure investment deals and peace efforts, culminating in a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate trade tensions. The trip, including stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, proceeds despite a prolonged US government shutdown causing federal workers to miss paychecks and flight disruptions. Critics, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, condemned the president's travel amidst domestic crisis, arguing he was "skipping town" while America was shut down. Trump also met with Qatar's leaders during a refueling stop, thanking them for their role in Middle East peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's favorability among Hispanic adults has sharply declined since the start of his second term, dropping from 44% to 25%, according to a new AP-NORC poll. This erosion of support, crucial to his 2024 re-election, is linked to growing unease over his hardline immigration enforcement and economic policies, which have directly affected Latino communities. The poll indicates increased Hispanic concern about the nation's direction, with only a quarter favoring mass deportations, while stress over groceries, housing, and healthcare has risen.

The National Transportation Safety Board's investigation found no signs of engine failure, with the inquiry into the precise cause of the accident ongoing.

          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, according to a DW fact check, despite accurately cited figures from the World Population Review. This article explains that major differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors make cross-country comparisons of sexual assault statistics problematic and often inaccurate. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys over police statistics for more accurate prevalence data, as official reports only capture a fraction of actual incidents. Furthermore, claims linking mass immigration to increased sexual assault rates are debunked, as there is no evidence to support such assertions.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after ingesting between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel due to pressure necrosis, a condition where tissue dies from prolonged pressure. The magnets, reportedly purchased online, clamped together inside his body, causing severe organ damage that required extensive exploratory surgery. While the boy recovered and was discharged after eight days, the incident highlights the extreme dangers of such magnets, which are banned in New Zealand but easily accessible online.

          <p>Passive investing through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly those tracking broad market indexes like the S&P 500, may be losing its appeal as investors increasingly seek greater diversification. Experts note that technology now dominates over 35% of the S&P 500, leading to an "imbalance" and reduced diversification within these popular funds. Consequently, there's renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high, outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months. This article suggests a potential shift in investment strategies as investors look beyond traditional index-based approaches for unique insights. (not investment advice)</p>
