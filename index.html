          <p>Gage Wood of Arkansas pitched the first College World Series no-hitter in 65 years, striking out a record 19 batters in a 3-0 victory against Murray State. Wood's performance was nearly perfect, with his bid for a perfect game ending only when he hit a batter in the eighth inning. Coach Dave Van Horn praised Wood's execution and the team's defensive plays behind him, highlighting Wood's progression from closer to weekend starter. The Razorbacks will continue in the elimination bracket, while Murray State concludes their first CWS appearance with two losses. The final out was a grounder snagged by first baseman Reese Robinett. The team celebrated Wood's achievement after the game, marking a historic moment in CWS history, with Wood giving the game ball to his dad for Father's Day. The score is based on the author's positive reflection of the historic baseball game.</p>

          <p>Following the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, top House Democrats are calling for increased security measures for members of Congress. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Joe Morelle urged Speaker Mike Johnson to allocate more funds for security in Washington and home districts. The request comes amid rising threats against lawmakers, with Capitol Police reporting a surge in concerning statements over the past two years. Vance Boelter faces multiple federal charges in connection to the shootings, which authorities describe as "political assassinations", with a list of 45 elected officials found during the investigation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the fatal shootings of Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, Republicans displayed a mixed response, ranging from condemnation to mockery. While some, like Utah Senator Mike Lee, initially condemned the violence, he later posted memes seemingly mocking the victims. Donald Trump initially condemned the attacks but subsequently criticized Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz. Experts warn that such divisive messages may resonate more widely than statements of sympathy, contributing to an atmosphere of political extremism. The University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats suggests joint statements from both parties are needed to counter the rise of violent populism.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case involving a New Jersey anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center, First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, and its attempt to block the state's attorney general from investigating whether it deceived women into believing it offered abortions.
