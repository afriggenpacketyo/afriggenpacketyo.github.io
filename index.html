          <p>England's cricket team claimed a 2-0 series win against Ireland after a six-wicket victory in the third Twenty20 match. A standout half-century from Jordan Cox, who scored 55 runs, anchored England's chase of Ireland's 155-run target. Ireland's innings was restricted by a strong English bowling performance, with Adil Rashid taking three wickets. Despite losing two early wickets, England comfortably reached the target with 17 balls to spare, sealing the win in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former President Donald Trump indicated that media moguls Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely involved in the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. This development comes as the Trump administration continues to oversee the sale of the Chinese-owned app due to national security concerns, a process mandated by a 2024 law. Trump also mentioned that Larry Ellison of Oracle and Michael Dell are part of the deal, describing the investors as "American patriots." The new structure would reportedly place six Americans on a seven-seat board, with Oracle managing U.S. data and algorithms.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned public statements made by U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner, calling his criticism of France's handling of antisemitism "unacceptable" for a diplomat. Kushner had accused Macron's government of insufficient action and linked its foreign policy, including gestures toward Palestinian statehood, to increased risks for Jewish citizens. Macron firmly rejected this, stating that while he was the first French president to equate anti-Zionism with antisemitism, disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies does not make one antisemitic. The French foreign ministry had previously summoned Kushner in a formal rebuke for interfering in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland's athletics team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo without a single gold medal for the first time since 2003. The team secured a total of five medals, their joint-lowest count since 2005, finishing 21st in the medal table. This performance marks a significant downturn from the 10 medals won at the previous championships and the Paris Olympics. Head coach Paula Dunn acknowledged the "mixed bag" of results, citing some missed opportunities and injuries to key athletes like Josh Kerr and Matthew Hudson-Smith, and noted the need for a thorough review ahead of future competitions.</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," IBM Vice Chairman Gary Cohn analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower interest rates for the first time since 2022. He noted that while the Fed projects two more cuts this year, these primarily affect overnight bank lending rates, not consumer borrowing costs for mortgages or car loans. Cohn also discussed the labor market, agreeing with the Fed's assessment that it is "cooling off," with job creation slowing significantly. He attributed this to companies cutting labor costs to maintain profit margins amid rising input costs from tariffs and other pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan stated that this reduction means Germany is investing far less in international cooperation than is urgently needed, especially with increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned of drastic consequences, with the NGO Help estimating that the cuts could result in over four million people losing food aid and 1.5 million losing basic healthcare.

          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this decline. However, Epel suggests this damage can be mitigated through daily practices aimed at restoring cellular health. She recommends creating an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle" by eating more fruits and vegetables, practicing short daily meditations, adding Omega-3s to one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to help manage stress effectively.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces has made history by winning the WNBA's Most Valuable Player award for a record fourth time, surpassing legends Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, and Lauren Jackson. This is her second consecutive MVP win, a feat previously achieved only by Cynthia Cooper. Wilson had a dominant season, leading the league in both scoring and blocked shots while guiding the Aces to the No. 2 seed in the playoffs. The 29-year-old star was also recently named the league's Co-Defensive Player of the Year for the third time in four seasons.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are re-evaluating their long-held opposition to national ID cards, a policy they helped block in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer reportedly planning a push for a digital ID scheme. Davey cited Estonia's digital ID system as a model that could empower individuals and increase access to services, but warned against any system that could be abused by an authoritarian government. The discussion at the party's conference revealed a divide among members, with many still holding strong civil liberties concerns.</p>

This extraordinary congress was held to provide Ozel with a fresh mandate ahead of an October 24 court ruling that could annul his initial 2023 election, a case critics view as politically motivated by President Erdogan's government. Ozel and other senior CHP figures, including jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, face various charges they maintain are baseless. The re-election is intended to demonstrate the party's unified support for its leadership in the face of what they see as a government crackdown.</p>

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has banned the use of plastic flying rings on its beaches to prevent harm to the local seal population. The circular toys pose a significant danger to young, curious seals, which can get them stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and often death. While the ban is voluntary and carries no penalties, it aims to raise public awareness and encourage support from retailers. The move follows similar actions by other councils and major retailers, and is part of a broader campaign for a UK-wide legislative ban on the hazardous toys.</p>

          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection. Key behaviors include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily interactions, fostering genuine confidence by allowing kids to try and fail, and teaching them how to repair relationships after conflict. By validating feelings and listening more than lecturing, parents teach children the foundational skills for building strong, healthy relationships.</p>

          <p>As premium travel credit cards increase their annual fees, a credit expert from The Points Guy, Brian Kelly, advises consumers on how to get the most value from their rewards cards. He argues against automatically choosing no-fee cards, as those with modest fees often provide significantly better rewards that justify the cost for most spenders. Other key mistakes to avoid include hoarding points, which can be devalued by issuers at any time, and failing to negotiate with the card company's retention department for fee waivers or bonus points before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

          <p>While the UK, Canada, and Australia's recognition of a Palestinian state is a significant symbolic step, it highlights profound practical challenges, particularly regarding leadership. The Palestinian political landscape is fragmented, with the Palestinian Authority governing parts of the West Bank and Hamas's influence in Gaza, though the latter is not seen as a viable long-term ruler by the international community. This article explores the deep divisions, the lack of recent elections, and the absence of a clear, unified leader, such as the imprisoned Marwan Barghouti, which complicates the path to a functional and sovereign state.</p>

The law includes exceptions for specific situations like undercover operations, disease prevention, and tactical gear.

          <p>Scientists analyzing two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter have found that they belong to a genetic lineage previously unknown to science. The mummies, who were female herders during the 'Green Sahara' period, were expected to have Sub-Saharan ancestry but instead are most closely related to a distinct North African group. This lineage diverged from Sub-Saharan populations much earlier and remained largely isolated. The findings suggest that pastoralism and other cultural practices likely spread through the region via cultural diffusion rather than large-scale migrations and genetic mixing.</p>
