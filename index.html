            <p>Wells Fargo analysts reported that Amazon is pausing some data center lease commitments, particularly international ones, mirroring similar actions by Microsoft. This adjustment is attributed to economic concerns affecting tech companies' spending plans, even as they invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Despite the pause, Amazon maintains that its overall data center expansion plans remain unchanged, viewing this as routine capacity management. The analysts have a hold rating on Amazon shares, indicating a neutral outlook on the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, with immigrant rights groups arguing that the allotted 24-hour notice is insufficient for migrants to fight their deportation orders. The ACLU argues that those facing deportation are not being afforded proper due process rights. The Supreme Court has issued a temporary halt to the deportations while the case proceeds, raising questions about the legal rights of migrants facing removal from the U.S.</p>

            <p>US stocks and the dollar plunged after President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on US central bank boss calling him "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates. In a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates "pre-emptively" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.</p>

            <h2>Layoffs of Federal Mediators Disrupt Labor Dispute Resolutions</h2>

            <p>The Trump administration's cost-cutting measures have led to the layoff of 130 federal mediators, effectively dismantling the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. This has raised concerns among unions and employers about resolving labor disputes, potentially leading to increased labor unrest. The terminations have already disrupted negotiations between major Southern California grocery chains and unions representing their workers, with concerns about the ability to effectively mediate disputes without the agency's resources.</p>

            <p>DHL has announced it will temporarily stop shipping packages over $800 in value to U.S. consumers due to more stringent U.S. customs rules implemented following the Trump administration's tariffs. The tariffs have led to increased scrutiny of parcels, causing shipping backlogs and delays. The new policy applies to packages sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers, while business-to-business shipments over $800 will continue but may face delays.</p>
