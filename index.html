          <p>A new pilot program is being trialled in primary schools across Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety. The initiative aims to reduce future skin cancer cases by educating students on UV levels and proper sunscreen application, with plans for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. The program seeks to empower children with knowledge to "grow skin cancer out of the next generation" amid rising melanoma diagnoses in the UK.</p>

The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite to monitor greenhouse gases. This launch marks the end of the H2A series, which has had a 98% success rate despite an early failure in 2003. The nation's space efforts will now be spearheaded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, which aims to compete in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>Two five-year-old European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in southwest England. The bears made their way to a staff food storage area, where they were discovered feasting on various snacks, including a week's supply of honey. Park visitors were moved to a secure building as a precaution, but the animals posed no threat and eventually returned to their enclosure on their own. The park attributed the incident to an "operational error" and is conducting an internal investigation to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a large-scale demonstration for human rights and solidarity. The significant turnout was seen as a direct response to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which had attempted to ban the event under a controversial "Child Protection" law. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, organizing the march as a council event. Participants, including many who don't typically attend, used the march to peacefully protest what they see as the government's increasingly authoritarian and anti-LGBT policies.</p>

Key disagreements remain over cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, as well as the bill's impact on the national deficit. While some GOP holdouts like Senator Susan Collins agreed to advance the bill, its final passage remains in doubt amid unified Democratic opposition.</p>

Solis argues that the aggressive tactics of agencies like ICE are terrorizing communities and violating residents' civil rights. This move mirrors a similar effort by the L.A.

It also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural victory for the Trump administration.

          <p>Two more men have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, bringing the total number of arrests to six. The incident involved activists from the group Palestine Action, who sprayed paint on military aircraft at the Oxfordshire airbase. Following the break-in, the UK government announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action, which would make it illegal to be a member of or support the group. The suspects, all arrested under the Terrorism Act, remain in police custody as the counter-terrorism investigation continues.</p>
