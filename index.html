          <p>A shooting incident outside an office building on Park Avenue in Manhattan resulted in an off-duty police officer and a civilian being wounded. The suspect, armed with a long gun, fled into the building, which houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the NFL. After a standoff, the gunman was found deceased on the 33rd floor from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, resolving the immediate threat to the area while leaving the motive under investigation.</p>

          <p>Cory Bowman, a candidate for mayor in Cincinnati, has publicly condemned the city's current leadership in the wake of a widely circulated video showing a brutal downtown assault. Bowman argues that failed policies and a perception that calling 911 is futile have contributed to a rise in crime, a sentiment echoed by a veteran police officer. He frames the incident as a wake-up call, suggesting it reflects a broader trend of deteriorating safety in American urban centers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a Trump-allied investment fund that aimed to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest-rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" that mandates open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge also questioned whether the lawsuit was primarily a publicity stunt intended to generate interest in the newly launched investment fund, a claim the fund's lawyer denied.

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles this past January caused approximately $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties alone. The analysis focused on homes within the city limits affected by the blazes, particularly the 23,000-acre Palisades fire, which destroyed numerous high-value homes in wealthy neighborhoods. This figure does not include damage to commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic impact of the fires is even greater. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A diplomatic rift has emerged between the U.S. and Israel after President Trump publicly contradicted Israeli assertions about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. While an Israeli military spokesman claimed images of starving Palestinians were "fake," Trump stated, "That's real starvation... you can't fake that." The disagreement comes as two Israeli human rights groups have characterized Israel's military campaign in Gaza as a genocide, adding to the intense international pressure on the Israeli government over the dire conditions in the Palestinian enclave.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated the deal would financially damage his country, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as an act of "submission." While many capitals expressed relief that a deal was reached, the consensus is that the terms, which include a 15% tariff on most EU exports, heavily favor the United States and represent a form of damage control.</p>

          <p>Economists are analyzing the new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, with many concluding that the terms are asymmetrical and favor American interests. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU goods, a sharp increase from previous levels, which is expected to negatively impact the EU's GDP. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs on some U.S. goods and commit to large purchases of American energy. While the deal reduces uncertainty, it is widely seen as a concession by the EU to avoid a more damaging trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
