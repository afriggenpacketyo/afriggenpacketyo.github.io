          <p>The Karen Read murder trial revealed voicemails Read allegedly left for her boyfriend, Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe, the morning he died. The voicemails, played in court, included angry and accusatory messages, with Read saying things like 'John, I f---ing hate you,' and accusing him of being a 'f---ing pervert.' Defense attorneys argue the voicemails portray Read as a frantic girlfriend unaware of O'Keefe's death, while prosecutors suggest she was covering her tracks. The trial also highlighted concerns about the handling of evidence at the scene, including the use of red Solo cups and a leaf blower.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amid trade tensions. The measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, and include a new relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While these steps signal a greater urgency to stimulate growth, some analysts believe their impact on domestic credit demand may be limited. These measures come as trade talks with the U.S. are expected to begin later this week, signaling a potential turning point in the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting raids targeting businesses and restaurants in Washington, D.C., according to local reports. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern, stating that the actions appear to be disrupting neighborhoods and not targeting criminals. An organization called CASA received specific warnings about the operation, including the possibility that ICE would use President Trump's executive order on the "beautification" of the capital as justification. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern over the reports, emphasizing the significant role immigrants play in the restaurant workforce and the local economy.</p>
