          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is expected to re-intensify. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where considerable flash flood warnings are in effect. While weather models predict Erin will turn north and stay off the U.S. mainland, its large size is expected to generate dangerous surf, high waves, and significant beach erosion along the East Coast from Florida to New England later in the week.</p>

          <p>Weeks before President Trump federalized the Washington, D.C. police force, the city's police union accused department leadership of manipulating crime statistics to present a more favorable image. The union chairman alleged that senior officers would direct members to report serious felonies, like shootings or carjackings, as lesser offenses. These accusations surfaced around the same time a police commander was suspended for allegedly falsifying data, providing a backdrop to the administration's decision to assume federal control over the department amidst a debate over the city's actual crime rates.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's federalization of police in Washington D.C. and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, mayors of other Democratic-run cities are preparing for similar actions. City leaders from Seattle, Minneapolis, and Baltimore are coordinating with police chiefs and governors to resist what they see as an illegal usurpation of local authority under the pretext of fighting crime. They argue that Trump is creating chaos to distract from his own political issues and that such federal interventions could escalate tensions rather than improve public safety.</p>

          <p>Long-distance runner Evie Parts has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, Swarthmore College, and members of its athletic department, alleging she was illegally removed from the women's track team because she is transgender. The lawsuit argues that the NCAA, as a private organization, cannot override federal and state anti-discrimination laws like Title IX. The complaint details the severe emotional distress Parts experienced after being told she could no longer compete with the women's team or receive coaching and support unless she joined the men's team, following a new NCAA policy.</p>

Sullivan also highlighted the growing military and strategic significance of the Arctic, praising recent investments in the Coast Guard and missile defense to counter Russian and Chinese activities in the region.

          <p>An opinion article highlights growing concern over the treatment of private entrepreneurs in China following the reported suicides of at least five prominent business leaders since April. The piece specifically mentions the case of a company chairman who took his own life just days after being released from detention by anti-corruption investigators. The author argues that to support the beleaguered private sector, Chinese authorities must strictly follow legal procedures when investigating business figures, ensuring their rights are protected and avoiding actions that create an environment of extreme pressure and despair.</p>

The survey found that 43% of respondents expect the AfD to lead at least one state government by next year, reflecting the party's sustained high ratings in national polls. This sentiment comes as several eastern German states, where the AfD has strong support, prepare for elections, challenging the country's mainstream political consensus of not cooperating with the far-right party.</p>

They contend that a law-enforcement-heavy approach ignores the progress made by community-based intervention programs, which focus on investing in infrastructure and providing support to at-risk individuals. These advocates believe the administration's actions are more about political posturing than genuine concern for the communities most affected by violence, and that true safety comes from investment, not just policing.</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free education. This article identifies nine such schools, including Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and the five U.S. service academies (Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine). While these institutions eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they are typically highly selective and require students to participate in work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation.</p>

          <p>In the three years since ChatGPT's launch, generative AI has fundamentally transformed the college experience, becoming an indispensable tool for a vast majority of students. This article explores how undergraduates now routinely use AI for everything from summarizing readings to completing assignments, driven by academic pressure and the desire for efficiency. While many professors seem unaware of the extent of AI's integration, the technology is forcing a reckoning in higher education, raising questions about academic integrity and the need to redesign teaching methods to adapt to this new reality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Supreme Court's decision to end race-based affirmative action, the focus has shifted to class-based preferences as an alternative for promoting diversity in college admissions. Proponents argue this approach can achieve both racial and economic diversity, as it would benefit disadvantaged students of all races. However, this strategy is now facing scrutiny from the Trump administration, which is collecting university admissions data and signaling that it may challenge class-based programs if they are perceived as a proxy for achieving racial diversity, creating a complex new legal and political battleground.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have arrived in the UK on small boats in the 11 days since the government's new "one in, one out" agreement with France was implemented. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one person with a strong asylum case, but removals have not yet begun. With over 50,000 crossings since the Labour government took power, ministers are under pressure to show results, though the deterrent effect of the new deal remains uncertain as crossings continue during the calmer summer months.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese universities are under fire from online nationalists for hosting events with Darius Longarino, a research scholar from Yale Law School. The controversy stems from social media users highlighting Longarino's past posts on X, where he criticized Beijing's policies in the Xinjiang region, including their impact on LGBTQ+ rights. In response to the backlash, at least three universities have removed online announcements about the lectures he delivered, demonstrating the sensitivity and potential repercussions for Chinese academic institutions engaging with Western scholars who have commented on contentious political issues.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to discover that his trail camera had captured an image of a brown bear, a species long considered extinct in the country. This rare sighting, along with another recent spotting of a bear cub, suggests the large predators may be returning to the local ecosystem.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a campaign for a ballot measure that would redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Democrats. This move is framed as a direct response to Republican-led gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas, with Newsom arguing that Democrats must "fight fire with fire" to counter what he calls an assault on democracy by Donald Trump. If passed by voters, the initiative would temporarily suspend the work of the state's independent redistricting commission, potentially flipping several Republican-held seats and creating a high-stakes political battle over electoral fairness.</p>
