The defense argues conflicting witness accounts and a possible road rage incident contributed to the crash.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to fund private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students get $2,000 annually. Supporters, including President Trump, hail the bill as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by diverting crucial funding. Opponents also believe the program will primarily benefit wealthier families already enrolled in private schools.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a stunning comeback victory in the Australian federal election, with his Labor party dramatically increasing its majority. Albanese's win defied the "incumbency curse," with the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffering a significant defeat. The election was dominated by cost-of-living concerns, but international relations, particularly dealing with Donald Trump, also played a role. Albanese promised to address healthcare affordability, housing access, climate change, and reconciliation for First Nations people.</p>

The new compromise measure pushes back deadlines, allows a two-year grace period for funding reserves, and permits associations to secure loans for repairs. Lawmakers acknowledge the need for ongoing attention to condo safety measures.</p>

Supporters argue this empowers parents, while opponents say it drains public school funding and primarily benefits wealthier families.
