          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. They are accused of the crime against humanity of gender-based persecution, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The court alleges a systematic deprivation of fundamental rights, including education, movement, and expression, which the Taliban has dismissed as "nonsense." The ICC relies on member states to enforce its warrants, as it has no police force of its own.</p>

          <p>U.S. soccer player Trinity Rodman has publicly requested that Wimbledon announcers refrain from mentioning her father, basketball hall-of-famer Dennis Rodman, during her boyfriend Ben Shelton's tennis matches. While attending Wimbledon to support Shelton, she expressed frustration on social media, stating that her father is not a part of her life and his name is irrelevant to Shelton's career. Rodman, an Olympic gold medalist and NWSL champion, has previously spoken about her complicated and distant relationship with her father. She emphasized that the focus should be on Shelton and his family's support system.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas have left at least 161 people missing in Kerr County alone, with the statewide death toll rising to at least 109. The disaster, which also triggered a flash flood emergency in New Mexico, has prompted extensive search and rescue operations involving helicopters and drones. Governor Greg Abbott has stated that emergency crews will persist until all missing individuals are accounted for. The event has raised questions about the adequacy of flood warnings and the timing of evacuations.</p>

          <p>A new book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House," claims that President Joe Biden's heavy reliance on teleprompters, even in intimate fundraising settings, frustrated donors and concerned his staff. The book alleges that aides used the device to keep the president on schedule and avoid unscripted moments as his health reportedly declined. It recounts an instance where Biden used a teleprompter for a small gathering in a private home, dashing supporters' expectations for a personal interaction. These claims are part of a larger narrative in the book detailing concerns within Biden's circle about his age and fitness for office.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced that federal immigration operations in Los Angeles have resulted in 2,792 arrests of undocumented individuals since early June. This figure represents a significant increase, with nearly 1,200 arrests occurring in just the last two weeks of the operation, which has involved ICE, CBP, and the federalized National Guard. The aggressive crackdown has drawn widespread condemnation from local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticize the tactics for creating fear in immigrant communities. The federal actions are seen as a test of executive authority in a city with leadership hostile to mass deportation policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move President Trump framed as necessary for national security. The decision follows an investigation into the effects of copper imports on American industry, with similar probes underway for other sectors like pharmaceuticals and lumber. Copper is a critical component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, and the announcement caused domestic prices to jump to a record high. The new tax is expected to take effect by the end of the month, though some countries may seek exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

Within hip-hop, this is complicated by a desire to protect the genre from racist stereotypes and to preserve a rare avenue for Black artists to achieve success.

This reflects a broader issue: as AI models grow more complex, their inner workings become opaque, and small tweaks can lead to alarming, misaligned behavior.

          <h2>The Atlantic Analysis: Blame Game Over Texas Floods Obscures Systemic Failures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 19:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, a rush to assign blame risks oversimplifying the complex web of factors that led to the tragedy. The disaster was a result of a confluence of events, including the region's natural geography as "Flash Flood Alley," the difficulty of precisely forecasting flash floods, and inconsistent cell service for alerts. Furthermore, past decisions, such as rejecting a flood-warning system due to cost and partisan erosion of support for federal weather services, played a role. This article argues that focusing on a single point of failure distracts from the larger challenge of systemic preparedness for increasingly extreme weather.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 19:03:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) is calling for urgent action to address the significant number of companies leaving the London Stock Exchange, a trend it calls a "pivotal moment" for the UK's financial sector. Since 2016, 213 firms have delisted, opting for foreign markets or private buyouts, which offer higher executive pay and less regulation. The CBI recommends lighter regulation and new incentives to encourage investment in British firms, including potential changes to tax-free cash ISAs to steer savings into more productive investments. The outflow threatens the financial services industry, which contributes 10% of all UK taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, is projected to be the most climate-damaging in the tournament's history, according to research from Scientists for Global Responsibility. The report calculates that the expanded 48-team format and reliance on air travel between venues will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is nearly double the average of the last four World Cups and significantly more than the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The environmental group attributes the massive carbon footprint to the continental scale of the event and the increased number of matches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's plan to secure numerous trade deals by leveraging tariff threats has been largely unsuccessful, as evidenced by the extension of a key deadline to August 1. This delay suggests that the White House has struggled to compel trading partners like Japan and South Korea to concede, as these nations are pushing back against the administration's demands. While the U.S. builds a tariff wall, global trade patterns are shifting, with countries like China increasing exports to other regions. The administration's inability to strike deals indicates that its hardball tactics have so far failed to produce the intended results. (not investment advice)</p>

Guevara, who fled El Salvador two decades ago, was arrested by local police and then turned over to ICE, despite having work authorization and a pending green card application.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with large-scale layoffs of federal government employees. A lower court had previously blocked the administration's plan, but the Supreme Court's order allows the firings to proceed while the case is fully litigated. The administration has proposed cutting over 100,000 federal jobs, with plaintiffs warning that entire programs could be dismantled at agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Department of Energy. The decision significantly expands the president's power to reshape the federal workforce, potentially hollowing out agencies before a final ruling is made.</p>

In his first public remarks on the matter, the head of the DGSE said that various stages of the program were "very seriously affected," though he noted that a significant portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium remains in its possession. The assessment comes after Iran suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), limiting the ability of international inspectors to monitor its nuclear activities and trace its uranium stockpile.</p>
