          <h2>Adidas Anticipates Price Increases on US Products Due to Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 08:44:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Adidas has announced that tariffs imposed by the U.S. government will lead to higher prices on all of its products sold in the United States. The company acknowledged uncertainty regarding the final tariff amounts and their impact on consumer demand, as it is difficult to quantify the exact effects. Adidas has already minimized exports of China-made products to the U.S., but it relies on factories in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia, which also face significant tariffs. The sportswear company is unable to produce almost any of its products in the U.S., leaving them vulnerable to price hikes due to international trade disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to visit Michigan to announce tariff relief measures for U.S. automakers. The move aims to reward companies manufacturing domestically and provide a transition for those committed to investing in America. While the 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and parts will remain, the announcement will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of existing ones, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for tariffs already paid, with a phased-out reimbursement for tariffs on foreign auto parts to encourage a shift in supply chains back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have been marked by a series of executive actions aimed at reshaping the federal government and pushing a cultural agenda. However, despite promises of economic grandeur, polls indicate broad economic anxiety among Americans, with a majority believing Trump's policies will cause a recession. Trump's approval rating is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, and his actions have faced resistance from institutions and nations alike. The Democratic Party is also undergoing soul-searching to determine its future messaging and leadership.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has faced an unprecedented legal blitz, with over 220 lawsuits filed in its first 100 days, challenging various aspects of its policies.

Critics decry the litigation as a "judicial coup," while opponents praise judges for serving as a check against the administration. The constant conflict between the Trump administration and the judiciary risks damaging the separation of powers, with allegations of the administration violating court orders.</p>

The proposed deal lacks U.S. aid to Ukraine and leaves open the possibility of European peacekeepers, which Putin has rejected.

          <p>Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, has requested a "real apology" from the band Kneecap after footage emerged of them allegedly calling for MPs to be killed. This follows the band's statement, which Cox deemed "only half an apology," suggesting a conspiracy and unfair targeting. Cox expressed willingness to meet with the band to discuss retaining their radicalism while condemning political violence. The police are assessing the footage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution.</p>
