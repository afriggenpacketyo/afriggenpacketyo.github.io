            <p>A federal judge has rebuked Justice Department attorneys for their inaction in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is being held in an El Salvador mega-prison after being deported despite a court order barring his deportation. The judge, Paula Xinis, has ordered government officials to testify under oath to determine if they are complying with court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, but has provided little evidence. The judge emphasized Abrego Garcia's right to due process and freedom from grave injury while detained in the Salvadoran prison.</p>

            <p>Senator Chuck Grassley faced heated questions at a town hall in Iowa regarding the Trump administration's compliance with court orders to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from detention in El Salvador.

Meanwhile, at a town hall held by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia, multiple people were removed from the event, with one protester being tased by police. Grassley defended the administration, stating that the El Salvador president is not subject to U.S. Supreme Court orders.</p>

            <p>President Trump has signed an executive action intended to lower prescription drug prices for Americans, including seniors. The action aims to improve the Medicare drug price negotiation program and potentially give insulin to low-income individuals at a reduced cost. However, any price breaks for consumers are expected to take time to materialize. The action also directs the FDA to facilitate approval of state drug importation programs and streamline approval for generics and biosimilars.</p>

            <p>Blue Origin's all-female space launch is facing scrutiny from some celebrities, including Emily Ratajkowski and Olivia Wilde, who criticize it as a wasteful and tone-deaf endeavor. Ratajkowski claimed that the flight highlighted the disparity between the wealthy and those struggling to afford basic necessities. Others defended the flight, with Gayle King stating that critics do not understand its significance and that it has inspired young women. The debate underscores the ongoing discussion about the ethics and implications of space tourism.</p>

            <p>China is exploring ways to increase trade with Southeast Asia to offset the potential impact of rising US import tariffs. Economists predict that China's growth could be negatively affected by the tariffs, but deeper ties with Southeast Asia could help mitigate the losses. The move comes as trade tensions between the US and China escalate, prompting Beijing to seek alternative markets for its exports. The economic surveillance office said Chinese reliance on the US market will set it back this year and next if the US tariff rate does not change.</p>

The FTC contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to Facebook. The trial could force Meta to divest the two apps, which have become social media powerhouses.</p>
