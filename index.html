          <h2>Study Suggests Cannabis Use May Harm Female Fertility</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports on a new study indicating that cannabis use may negatively affect female fertility by disrupting egg cell development and genetic stability. The study examined the effects of THC on human eggs in the lab and IVF outcomes of patients with detectable THC in their follicular fluid. Results showed that THC-positive patients had a significantly lower rate of euploid embryos, reducing the chances of a successful pregnancy. German experts suggest that further research is needed to examine the effects of THC on different age groups and consider other influential factors. </p>

          <p>Australia is investing AU$12 billion to upgrade a shipyard in Henderson as part of its AUKUS agreement with the UK and the US to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The investment will transform the shipyard into a maintenance center for the future fleet, bolstering Australia's strategic capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region. The upgraded facility will also support the construction of landing craft and frigates, creating thousands of local jobs. The United States will also have access to the facility. </p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, president of the UN General Assembly, has suggested the possibility of deploying UN peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to safeguard a ceasefire and post-war peace. This idea hinges on the support of a majority of UN member states, but would also require Russia's approval within the Security Council. Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia have stalled, with Russia demanding that Ukraine abandon its NATO and EU ambitions. The deployment of UN peacekeepers remains a distant prospect. </p>

          <p>California lawmakers have voted to ban PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," in cookware and other household items, approving Senate Bill 682. The bill, supported by actor Mark Ruffalo, targets PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging, and certain children's products, citing health risks. The bill's passage is being met with pushback from celebrity chefs and cookware manufacturers who argue that nonstick pans are safe when manufactured and used correctly.
