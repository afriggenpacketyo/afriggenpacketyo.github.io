        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the heist, which was executed in just nine minutes after the thieves disabled local communication networks. The stolen treasure, considered the largest find of Celtic gold in the 20th century, remains mostly missing, with investigators believing a portion has been melted down. The court case also addressed other robberies committed by the group across Germany and Austria since 2014.</p>

          <p>Luxury group Kering announced a significant 15% drop in second-quarter sales, falling short of analyst expectations amid persistent challenges. The group's flagship brand, Gucci, experienced a particularly sharp 25% plunge in sales, contributing heavily to the disappointing results. Chairman François-Henri Pinault acknowledged the poor performance but expressed confidence in the company's long-term turnaround strategy, which includes the recent appointment of a new CEO. The company cited a difficult geopolitical environment and weak demand in key markets like China and the United States as primary factors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rescinding the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action aimed at boosting the economy, while critics argue it undermines efforts to combat climate change. The proposal, which would affect regulations on vehicles and power plants, is expected to face significant legal challenges. Former EPA leaders have condemned the plan, stating it abandons the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.</p>

          <p>British Transport Police are seeking to question far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, following an alleged assault at St Pancras station in London. A video circulating on social media shows Robinson near a man lying motionless on the floor, though it does not depict the assault itself. Police reported that a man was taken to a major trauma center with serious injuries and that a 42-year-old suspect from Bedfordshire flew out of the country early Tuesday. Authorities are continuing their investigation to bring the suspect in for questioning.</p>

Despite the immediate market reaction, PayPal raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast, suggesting expectations for a stronger performance later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates a significant drop in job approval for President Trump among young Americans since his inauguration, falling from 55% to 28% for those aged 18-29. The decline is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged young voters, particularly young men. Polling suggests this shift is driven by a perception that Trump is not fulfilling campaign promises and by growing economic concerns. A majority of young people now feel his policies are making them financially worse off and that the administration is not focusing enough on lowering prices.</p>

The IMF noted that a surge in U.S. imports, as businesses rushed to get ahead of new taxes, contributed to the revised outlook but also created risks of overstocking.

However, the consumer goods giant issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, forecasting a $1 billion pretax hit from tariffs, which will necessitate price increases on about a quarter of its products. The company described the current consumer as "value-seeking" and "selective," baking a level of uncertainty into its guidance.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that with a solid labor market, no immediate cuts are necessary, and he wants to be prepared for potential inflation from new tariffs.
