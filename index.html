          <p>Dan Caldwell, recently fired from the Pentagon amid a leak investigation, vehemently denied leaking classified information in a 90-minute interview with Tucker Carlson. Caldwell, a former advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, refuted claims of sharing classified material and blamed leaks on career staff hostile to the administration. He specifically denied taking photos of classified information or communicating with a particular media outlet. Caldwell suggested that discontent among some Joint Staff members towards the President and Secretary's policies was the source of the leaks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass unveiled a proposed budget that addresses a nearly $1 billion financial gap through significant cuts, including the elimination of approximately 1,650 city worker positions via layoffs. While the Fire Department is slated to receive funding for new hires, many other agencies face deep spending reductions due to rising personnel costs and a slowing economy. The Los Angeles Police Department would see over 400 civilian layoffs, reducing the number of officers to the lowest level since 1995. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, seeking state financial assistance to mitigate the impact on city services.</p>

          <p>Following Nico Iamaleava's controversial move from Tennessee to UCLA amid NIL disputes, UCLA quarterback Joey Aguilar is now transferring to Tennessee. Iamaleava's initial departure from Tennessee stemmed from reported disagreements over a $4 million NIL deal, while Aguilar's transfer was prompted by Iamaleava's arrival at UCLA. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, brings a strong record of 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns from his previous two seasons at Appalachian State.

          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, Los Angeles residents, particularly those of Latino descent, reflected on his legacy of social justice and support for marginalized communities. Many praised his commitment to the poor, migrants, and his willingness to challenge political leaders on issues such as immigration. Theologians highlighted his actions, such as organizing events for missing women and washing the feet of detainees, as evidence of his dedication to social justice. The Pope's last message reiterated his commitment to migrants, a defining characteristic of his papacy.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, contesting its attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to review billions in federal funding. The lawsuit challenges the administration's demands, which include appointing an outside overseer to ensure diverse viewpoints at the university. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that the government should not dictate academic matters, and the university aims to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants. The White House argues that taxpayer funds are a privilege Harvard fails to meet the conditions to access.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region believed to be involved in consciousness. This map details the connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, potentially aiding in understanding cognitive functions like memory integration. The research also revealed structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, which could offer insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. The claustrum's role in functions like sleep regulation, depression, and cognitive control has been previously noted, but its molecular organization was poorly understood.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, delivered her closing argument in an Arizona trial where she is charged with conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband. Daybell maintains that her brother shot her husband in self-defense, while prosecutors argue it was a ploy to collect life insurance and be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The prosecution presented evidence of text messages and religious beliefs used to justify the murder. The jury is now deliberating the verdict.</p>

The county claims the documents are irrelevant and that personnel files do not pertain to the staff named in the lawsuits. The discovery comes as the county plans to pay $4 billion to settle thousands of sexual abuse claims.</p>
