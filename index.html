          <p>The Secret Service questioned former FBI Director James Comey about an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to spell "86 47," a phrase critics use to dismiss or remove Trump. Administration officials, including Kristi Noem and Tulsi Gabbard, interpreted the post as an assassination threat. Comey deleted the post after criticism, stating he didn't realize the numbers' association with violence and opposes violence. Trump, claiming Comey was calling for his death, suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi should handle the matter, labeling Comey a "dirty cop".</p>

While some blame Biden's inner circle for covering up the issue, the author argues that many Democrats were lying to themselves.

Fishing rights are also a point of contention, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements, while UK fishing groups want changes to the post-Brexit deal.
