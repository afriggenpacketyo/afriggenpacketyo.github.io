          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, may soon conclude. Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that the Fed is approaching its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks, suggesting the balance sheet runoff could stop in the coming months. He defended the practice of paying interest on bank reserves as crucial for controlling monetary policy. However, Powell remained noncommittal on the future direction of interest rates, citing a softer labor market and the need to navigate risks to both employment and inflation.

          <p>The World Health Organization is sounding the alarm over the increasing crisis of antimicrobial resistance, revealing that one in six bacterial infections are now resistant to antibiotics. A new report highlights a dangerous surge in "superbugs," particularly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, which can lead to sepsis and death. The WHO attributes the crisis to the natural mutation of germs as well as the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial medicines. The agency is calling for more responsible use of antibiotics and improved global surveillance to combat the threat, which is linked to over a million deaths annually.</p>

          <p>Chinese drone maker DJI is appealing a U.S. federal court decision that kept the company on a Pentagon blacklist of firms allegedly tied to China's military. DJI filed the appeal arguing that it is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military and that its inclusion on the list has unfairly stigmatized the company as a national security threat. While placement on the Department of Defense list does not trigger immediate bans, it serves as a strong warning to U.S. entities about the risks of doing business with the listed companies. The designation has reportedly cost DJI business deals both in the U.S. and internationally.</p>

Prosecutors argued that Shockley killed the trooper to stop an investigation into a fatal car crash, presenting circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the policy is designed to ensure migrants can fully contribute to national life.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones regarding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. This decision leaves the record-breaking financial penalty in place. Jones was found liable for damages after repeatedly claiming the massacre was a hoax, leading to years of harassment and threats against the victims' families. His lawyers had argued to the court that the massive sum could never be paid, but the court's refusal to hear the case finalizes the judgment from the Connecticut trial.</p>

The signs, created by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, are part of a broader "Know Your Rights" campaign aimed at informing people of their constitutional protections when encountering immigration officials.</p>

          <p>An elite military unit in Madagascar, known as CAPSAT, has announced it has seized power from President Andry Rajoelina, who has reportedly fled the country. The move follows weeks of youth-led "Gen Z" protests against chronic water and power shortages, corruption, and the high cost of living. The head of CAPSAT stated the military would form a new government and hold elections within two years, while the president's office has denounced the action as a coup. The African Union has warned against unconstitutional changes of government, as troops and protesters celebrate the ousting of the president in the capital.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding Louisiana's congressional map, a case that could significantly weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The dispute centers on a redrawn map that created a second majority-Black district to comply with the act, which a lower court then struck down as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The justices will now consider whether the intentional creation of a majority-minority district violates the Constitution. A ruling in favor of those challenging the map could prohibit the consideration of race in redistricting and deliver another major blow to the landmark 1965 civil rights law.</p>

The article suggests that a "good" rate is at or below the current average of 7.84%, but notes that this is an evolving benchmark as rates may continue to drop.

          <p>An analysis of the recent Gaza ceasefire deal notes that President Trump's intervention was decisive in securing the agreement for a hostage and prisoner exchange. However, the article argues that this achievement is not a comprehensive roadmap to lasting peace, as significant political will and detailed planning are still absent. The ceasefire remains fragile, with potential for violations from both sides and no clear plan for disarming Hamas or governing a post-war Gaza. While Trump can claim credit for the immediate deal, the underlying conflicts and lack of a true peace process suggest the region's long-term stability remains highly uncertain.</p>
