          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves across the Pacific. Warnings were issued for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan, prompting evacuations and travel disruptions. While initial waves in Hawaii were smaller than feared, causing some flooding, the warning was later downgraded to an advisory. The event caused minor injuries and some damage in Russia but avoided the catastrophic impact initially feared, with most alerts being lowered after several hours of vigilance.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the four victims killed in a shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office building, including an off-duty NYPD officer and a Blackstone executive. The gunman, who appeared to be targeting the NFL offices in the same building, left a note blaming the league for a past head injury. The victims were identified as Officer Didarul Islam, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner, security guard Aland Etienne, and Rudin Management employee Julia Hyman. An NFL employee was also injured in the attack, and the investigation remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he may not attend the upcoming G20 summit in South Africa, citing the nation's "very bad policies." Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump expressed strong disapproval, alluding to violence and the alleged targeting of white farmers, an issue he has previously raised with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. This follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio's boycott of a G20 foreign ministers' meeting over the country's land seizure policies, signaling ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has disclosed that only two law enforcement witnesses, an FBI agent and an NYPD detective, testified before the grand juries investigating Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. In a court filing, the DOJ stated that much of this testimony was consistent with accounts later made public during trial by victims. The government has proposed unsealing the transcripts with redactions to protect victim identities.

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level since May, with total application volume falling by 3.8% last week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, this decline is driven more by consumer uncertainty about the economy and job market than by interest rates, which have remained relatively stable. Applications for both home purchases and refinancing decreased, indicating that prospective buyers are hesitant to make major financial commitments despite slowing home-price growth.

          <p>In remarks to DW, President Donald Trump indicated that Ukrainian refugees who fled to the United States following Russia's invasion will likely be allowed to remain in the country. This statement appears to clarify the administration's position after a previous executive order raised doubts about the "Uniting for Ukraine" parole program. Approximately 240,000 Ukrainians have come to the U.S. since the war began, and their residency status had been uncertain. The article also notes a successful Ukrainian special forces raid on Russian-occupied territory.</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Adidas has announced it will raise prices for American consumers due to the impact of U.S. tariffs on goods from Asia. The company warned that the import taxes will add an estimated €200 million to its costs for the remainder of the year. Nearly half of Adidas products are manufactured in Vietnam and Indonesia, countries recently affected by new U.S. trade deals. This move follows similar announcements from rivals, signaling a broader trend of tariff-related price hikes for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the challenges facing rugby union in Australia, where it competes for talent with the more dominant sports of rugby league (NRL) and Australian Rules Football (AFL). Experts suggest that if top athletes from those leagues played union, the national team would be a dominant global force. Despite being a minority sport, there is hope for Australian rugby with upcoming major events like the Lions tour and home World Cups. The team's recent gritty performance against the Lions is seen as a potential turning point.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved a draft budget for 2026 totaling €520.5 billion, signaling a shift away from its traditional fiscal conservatism. The budget includes significant new borrowing to fund increased spending on modernizing infrastructure and boosting defense capabilities. This comes as new data shows the German economy contracted slightly in the second quarter. In other news, Berlin's famous New Year's Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate has been canceled due to a withdrawal of city funding, citing tight budgets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the work of Lawrence Dennis, a Black intellectual who passed as white and argued for fascism in America during the 1930s. Dennis believed the Great Depression proved that liberalism had failed and that a state-controlled economy was necessary. The author argues that Dennis's arguments contain two "anti-liberal traps" also present in modern critiques of liberalism. These traps are: incorrectly claiming a recent crisis proves liberalism's inevitable doom, and idealizing illiberal alternatives while ignoring their real-world dangers.</p>

          <p>The women-only dating safety app Tea has suspended its direct messaging function after a significant cybersecurity breach exposed user data. The company confirmed that some direct messages were accessed, in addition to a previously reported leak of 72,000 user images, including some with photo identification. The app, which has 1.6 million users and allows women to share information about men they date, is now working to identify affected users and offer identity protection services. The hack was reportedly instigated by users of the 4chan message board.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Diego FC, the newest expansion team in Major League Soccer, is achieving historic success by employing a uniquely high-risk, possession-based style of play. The team, part of the Right to Dream ownership group, emphasizes building from the back, often putting its young defenders in high-pressure situations to draw in opponents. This strategy, which involves goalkeepers rarely playing long passes, is designed to create space for their star attackers. Despite the risks, the approach is paying off, with San Diego currently leading the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>This commentary uses the recent data breach of the women's dating safety app Tea to reflect on the broader issue of data insecurity online. The author notes that such apps exist because mainstream platforms fail to protect women, yet they can create new vulnerabilities. The hack, reportedly an act of revenge by misogynistic trolls, exposed sensitive user images and private messages, turning a supposed safe space into a source of harm. The incident serves as a stark reminder that personal data entrusted to online services is rarely secure.</p>
