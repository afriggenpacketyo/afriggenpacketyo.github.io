          <p>The article details Vice President JD Vance's growing influence within the Trump administration, highlighting his crucial role in navigating a major tax and spending bill through Congress. By engaging with legislative holdouts and casting tie-breaking votes, Vance has solidified his position as a key operator for the president's domestic agenda. He has also been instrumental in shaping foreign policy discussions, balancing his previous non-interventionist stance with the administration's current objectives, positioning himself as a potential successor to Trump.</p>

          <p>Skin and hair specialists advise against going to bed with wet hair, warning that the practice can lead to significant scalp and skin problems. When hair is wet, it becomes more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase. The damp, warm environment created on the scalp is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria, potentially causing dandruff, irritation, or folliculitis, while also transferring microbes to pillowcases, which can contribute to facial acne.</p>

          <p>This opinion article frames President Trump's announcement of a UFC event at the White House as more than mere entertainment, arguing it represents a form of "authoritarian theatre." The author draws parallels between Trump's use of the UFC's machismo and spectacle to project a strongman image and the political pageantry used by historical fascist regimes like Mussolini's Italy. The piece contends that this event is the culmination of a partnership that blurs entertainment with confrontational politics, celebrating a brand of nationalistic masculinity.</p>

          <p>The long-standing debate over whether culture influences how people see the world is explored through two recent studies with conflicting findings on visual illusions. One study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments perceive illusions differently than those from rural Namibian communities, supporting the idea that our surroundings shape perception. However, another study compellingly refutes this hypothesis for the famous Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects animals and even the congenitally blind. The article concludes that perception is a complex brain construction, highlighting the need for more research into both inter- and intra-cultural perceptual diversity.</p>

          <h2>UK Pride Events, Including London's, Face Uncertain Future Amid Funding Shortfalls</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite drawing over a million people, Pride in London and other LGBTQ+ events across the UK are facing significant financial struggles due to a drop in corporate sponsorships and volunteer numbers. A survey of Pride organizers revealed that many have seen revenue fall by over 25%, with some losing more than half. This funding crisis, attributed partly to a pullback in corporate diversity initiatives, has already led to the cancellation or scaling back of several regional Prides, forcing some to charge for previously free events to cover essential safety costs.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover "Genetic Switch" for Organ Regeneration in Mice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a potential breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in development. By reactivating a disabled genetic pathway, the scientists were able to achieve complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue. This discovery offers hope that similar regenerative mechanisms might be present in other organs and could one day be applied to humans.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the media and political firestorm over a "Death to the IDF" chant led by the punk band Bob Vylan at Glastonbury. The author argues that portraying this as "appalling hate speech" is a diversionary tactic that ignores the catastrophic death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article suggests that this "Vylanising" of the discourse creates a false choice between opposing antisemitism and being horrified by the slaughter of civilians. It concludes that this strategy is increasingly failing as public sympathy for Palestinians grows.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided home loss in stadium history, falling 18-1 to the Houston Astros in a game marked by dominant performances from Astros players and a disastrous Dodgers pitching collapse. Houston's Jose Altuve and Christian Walker tormented the Dodgers, with Altuve hitting two home runs and Walker adding another. The game spiraled out of control in the sixth inning when the Dodgers' bullpen surrendered ten runs, silencing the sold-out Independence Day crowd at Chavez Ravine.</p>

          <p>The administration of Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te is facing criticism for its approach to commemorating the legacy of World War II. Critics argue that by emphasizing Taiwan's separate identity, the government is honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This creates a historical dilemma, as the Kuomintang (KMT) forces that fought Japan as a key Allied power later retreated to Taiwan, continuing to use the ROC title which Lai's government now re-contextualizes.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece draws parallels between Donald Trump's presidency and the leadership styles of postcolonial dictators in Africa during the Cold War. The author argues that Trump's actions, such as renaming landmarks, using military force against domestic protesters, and embracing theatrical economic policies, echo tactics used by figures like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The analysis suggests that this style of governance, once supported by the U.S. abroad as a bulwark against communism, is now manifesting domestically, representing a startling reversal in American political norms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made a demonstrably false claim during an attack on renewable energy, stating he has "never seen a wind farm in China" and questioning if the country uses them. The statement was quickly fact-checked, as China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, with significantly more capacity than the United States. This comment comes as his administration's new spending bill is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move that research firms and trade unions warn could decimate the U.S. renewables industry.</p>
