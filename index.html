          <p>President Trump's contemplation of joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities has exposed a deep rift among his supporters. While on the campaign trail, Trump criticized 'stupid endless wars' but also insisted Iran 'can't have a nuclear weapon,' resulting in conflict between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party. Conservative Congressman Thomas Massie introduced a bill to block unauthorized hostilities with Iran, supported by proponents of Trump's 'America First' doctrine. Former strategist Steve Bannon argued against intervention, fearing it would undermine Trump's coalition and his deportation agenda, illustrating the intensity of the internal dispute.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals needing to renew, apply for a new passport, or change their name or sex designation to choose the gender they identify with, including selecting 'X' on the application. This expands on an earlier decision that only applied to six plaintiffs, reversing a Trump-era policy that mandated only male or female designations. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory, with the judge agreeing that the administration failed to provide a rationale for the change.</p>

A DHS spokesperson claimed Lander assaulted law enforcement, but charges were later dropped, with Governor Hochul expressing dismay at the incident. Lander spoke out about the arrest, highlighting the lack of due process for individuals like Edgardo, who he was assisting and who remains in ICE detention, raising concerns about the rule of law and constitutional democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, with Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment site, being a potential target. Sources indicate disagreement among Trump's advisors on how to proceed, with discussions expected during a meeting with his national security team. Israel has alleged Iran is rapidly advancing towards nuclear weapons, while a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year suggested Iran is not currently building them. Despite not ruling out involvement, Trump has raised questions about the U.S.'s role through posts on Truth Social, including claiming 'complete and total control of the skies over Iran'.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, former border czar, asserts that President Trump's leadership has led to the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the 'vast majority' of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., compared to zero releases under Trump. He advocates for the passage of the 'Big Beautiful Bill' to solidify these gains and implement a large-scale deportation operation. These numbers reflect a trend since Trump's return to office, with significantly fewer releases of illegal immigrants compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court signaled it may have limited power to rule against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in California. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding California's challenge to Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The judges questioned the extent of their authority over the president's commander-in-chief powers, with the government arguing Trump acted within his discretion due to violent riots. California argued the deployment diverted guardsmen from critical work and defied state sovereignty, but the judges seemed skeptical of the clarity of requirements for consulting the governor before deployment.</p>

Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, with many finding new homes in North Sea biodiversity hotspots. Native oysters, basking sharks, and spurdog sharks are expected to benefit, while static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle. This analysis aims to guide government efforts to protect marine species as climate change alters their habitats.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department announced the deployment of 2,000 additional California National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area amid ongoing immigration enforcement. The troops will support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property under Title 10 law. This deployment joins the existing 4,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines already in L.A., with the new troops undergoing training on de-escalation, crowd control, and use of force. The move has faced criticism from local and state officials who argue it inflames tensions in the city, which has a large immigrant community.</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing diplomatic solutions and military action regarding Iran, with U.S. officials signaling the next 24 to 48 hours as critical. Trump increased rhetoric against Iran, asserting knowledge of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's location and warning against attacks on civilians or American soldiers. Despite this, U.S. negotiators assess Iran is in a weak position and could return to negotiations, potentially leading to a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region for defensive purposes, but this also leaves options open for assisting Israel's offensive against Iran.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is altering holiday travel, with many Europeans modifying plans due to climate change. The 2023 summer heatwave, causing over 47,000 deaths in Europe, has prompted travelers to seek milder destinations or travel during cooler months. A report indicates 81% of Europeans have adjusted holiday plans due to climate-related factors, with almost a third choosing destinations with milder weather. This shift could impact Mediterranean resorts reliant on summer tourism, with some adapting by offering evening activities and investing in winter connectivity.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell 1.7% year-over-year in May, the sharpest decline since September 2024, primarily due to decreased shipments to the U.S. and China. Exports to the U.S. dropped 11.1%, with motor vehicle exports plummeting 24.7%, affected by potential tariffs. The Bank of Japan noted that trade uncertainties could moderate growth and reduce corporate profits. This decline contributed to Japan's economy shrinking 0.2% in the first quarter, and the trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US buyer, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The extension will ensure the deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure. Trump tried to force a sale of TikTok to an American buyer in 2020, during his first term in office. But last year, Trump said he liked the platform because he believed it had helped him win the 2024 presidential election.</p>
