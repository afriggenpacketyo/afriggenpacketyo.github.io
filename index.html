          <h2>Trump's Use of National Emergency Declarations Examined</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's repeated use of national emergency declarations to bypass congressional action is under scrutiny. Since taking office for his second term, Trump has declared eight emergencies on issues ranging from the southern border to trade with China. These declarations unlock special presidential powers, prompting legal challenges and debates over their legitimacy. Experts like Elizabeth Goitein from the Brennan Center for Justice argue that Congress should re-evaluate the scope of presidential emergency powers to prevent potential abuse, especially given Trump's unconventional approach to governance.</p>

          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is actively pursuing a deal with the EU to allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues and improve travel efficiency. The minister also expressed optimism about securing a youth mobility scheme and lowering food prices through reduced trade red tape. However, Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns that the proposed agreement could lead to the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by adhering to EU standards without having a say in future decisions. Liberal Democrat MP Calum Miller urged the government to pursue a customs union with the EU, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized potential deals on youth mobility and fishing rights as a betrayal of Brexit.</p>

          <p>Climate and environmental protesters are facing increasingly harsh penalties, including jail time and hefty fines, for disrupting major infrastructure and raising awareness about climate change. Countries like Australia, the UK, and Germany have enacted stringent anti-protest laws, leading to arrests and severe sentences for nonviolent actions. Additionally, fossil fuel companies are pursuing strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP) to silence dissent and impose massive compensation claims on activists. While some view these measures as necessary to prevent disruption, others argue they stifle legitimate forms of dissent and serve to protect fossil fuel industry profits.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has experienced a record low approval rating of 27.4 percent, triggered by growing public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising prices. The plunge comes ahead of the House of Councillors election, with many criticizing Ishiba's dismissal of consumption tax cuts as a solution to inflation. A Kyodo News survey revealed that a majority of respondents support slashing consumption taxes to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis, while expressing concerns about potential declines in social security services. The survey also indicated low expectations for favorable outcomes from Japan-U.S. tariff talks.</p>

          <p>A recent escalation in conflict between India and Pakistan has highlighted India's ongoing struggle to manage its relationship with its neighbor, hindering its ambitions as a major diplomatic and economic power. Despite military advances, India's strategic goals are set back by being equated with Pakistan, a country it views as a sponsor of terrorism. The article suggests that India's leaders have been perplexed on how to resolve the conflict with Pakistan since the countries were split in 1947. The conflict is further complicated by nuclear arsenals, religious nationalism, and superpower politics, making outright military victory nearly impossible and perpetuating a cycle of violence and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump administration has announced the resumption of collection activity on federal student loans, including wage garnishment, tax refund seizures, and Social Security benefit reductions. This policy shift will affect millions of borrowers already struggling with high living costs, potentially forcing them to make difficult choices between essential expenses. While the administration argues that borrowers should repay their debts, critics contend that many are genuinely unable to afford payments and that the consequences of garnishment can be devastating. Borrowers are also facing challenges navigating the complex lending system, including staffing shortages and repayment plan transitions.</p>

Opinion polls suggest that Luis Montenegro's Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes but fail to secure a parliamentary majority.

Despite television footage and live-timing data appearing to support Bearman's claim, the FIA maintains that the red flag was initiated before he crossed the finish line. Bearman expressed his frustration, stating that the red light on his dash appeared after he crossed the line and that the decision seemed unfair.

          <p>Despite a decline in safety performance, including a surge in fires sparked by its equipment and employee fatalities, some top executives at Southern California Edison received increased cash bonuses. While the utility's parent company, Edison International, cut executive bonuses overall due to safety failures, individual bonuses for some executives rose because of their performance in other areas. Consumer advocates argue that this highlights a flaw in AB 1054, a law intended to tie executive compensation to safety performance, as the incentives for prioritizing safety appear weak. The utility is seeking to raise customer electric rates by more than 10% this year.</p>
