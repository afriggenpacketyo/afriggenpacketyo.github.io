          <p>Democrats are seeking to leverage parents' anxieties over increasing baby gear prices, driven by President Trump's tariff policies, and vaccine misinformation linked to both Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Measles outbreaks are causing fear among parents, while federal support for safe infant sleep campaigns has seemingly been reduced. Democrats aim to persuade voters that the Trump administration's policies are negatively impacting their families. The article suggests that Democrats see an opportunity to connect with parents by addressing their concerns about public health and the rising costs associated with raising children, particularly in contrast to Republican messaging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, Barry Diller, a prominent figure in TV, film, and media, discusses the importance of instinct over relying solely on data when making creative and business decisions. He argues that instinct is a better predictor of success than research, which can be harmful and narrow-minded. Diller recounts his experience with the made-for-TV "Movie of the Week" at ABC, emphasizing the value of a good title and trusting one's gut feeling. He also highlights the success of projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were greenlit based on instinct rather than extensive data analysis.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir. The conflict rapidly escalated into airstrikes and drone attacks, hitting sensitive military targets on both sides.

While both governments have taken a tough stance, there are indications that officials are seeking a path to reduce tariffs, as American companies face bankruptcy and Chinese factories shutter.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly set to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the royal family of Qatar during his upcoming trip to the Middle East. The plan is for U.S. officials to convert the plane into a potential presidential aircraft. Trump intends to use the Qatari aircraft as a new version of Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office in January 2029, when ownership will be transferred to the foundation overseeing his presidential library. However, the aircraft would have more limited capabilities than the existing Air Force One planes, lacking features like air-to-air refueling.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The government aims to reduce net migration by requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country, expecting to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers over the next year. While the government avoids setting specific targets, it intends to increase the threshold for skilled visas and narrow exceptions for temporary shortage visas. The changes also include new training commitments to re-integrate non-working individuals into the UK labor market.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering reducing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport after a series of equipment failures and air traffic controller shortages caused significant disruptions.

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests extending the celebration of Father's Day into a month-long event, following Mother's Day. Gaffigan proposes "Father's Day Month" as an off-and-on holiday, where dads receive a present on even days and are left alone on odd days, creating a "Ramadad." While acknowledging the concept is new and might seem excessive, Gaffigan playfully argues that fathers deserve the extended recognition, while still honoring mothers with their dedicated day. The comedian’s piece is a lighthearted commentary on the societal focus on mothers and the desire for fathers to receive equal appreciation.</p>

          <p>Wildfires have broken out across Britain, including Scotland, Wales, and England, due to the driest start to spring in almost 70 years. A large forest fire near Fauldhouse, Scotland, required the deployment of 50 firefighters and a water-dropping helicopter. The risk has been amplified by unusually dry conditions, with England experiencing significantly below-average rainfall in March and April. The European Union's Copernicus climate service has issued drought warnings for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and England's Environment Agency has warned of a medium risk of drought this summer if rainfall does not improve.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future, aligning with President Trump's earlier comments.

However, data indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. Lutnick also said that domestic producers will not have the tariff, allowing foreigners to compete.</p>
