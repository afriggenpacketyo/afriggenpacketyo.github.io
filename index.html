          <p>Nintendo shares have surged this year, adding approximately $39 billion to the company's value, fueled by the release of the Switch 2 console, the successor to the original Switch. The hybrid console, which can be played on a TV or on the go, has seen strong sales since its launch, with 3.5 million units sold in the first four days. Investors are optimistic that the Switch 2 will replicate the success of its predecessor, which has sold over 152 million units since its release. Nintendo has historically leveraged its strong franchises like Super Mario, Zelda, and Pokemon to boost console sales and expand into movies and theme parks, a strategy that has significantly increased the company's market capitalization. The article reflects on the financial success of Nintendo's strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty payments amid rising tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. This practice involves modifying products' materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products create opportunities for companies to benefit from tariff engineering. Winnebago Industries, for example, is exploring tariff mitigation strategies, including tariff engineering, to manage costs. The article examines the clever methods businesses use to navigate complex tariff systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, charged with fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding another Democrat, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, could face the death penalty under federal charges. Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, making this a rare instance, though federal prosecutors have the option to pursue it, especially under the Trump administration's renewed focus on federal executions. Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson described the attack as meticulously planned, with evidence suggesting Boelter targeted multiple Democratic lawmakers. The federal intervention has created tension with the Hennepin County Attorney, who intends to pursue state charges as well, raising questions about jurisdiction and the potential challenge of selecting a jury in a state that has long rejected the death penalty.</p>
