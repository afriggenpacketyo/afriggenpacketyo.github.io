          <h2>Japanese Opposition Party Seeks Food Tax Cut Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 04:37:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), is proposing a one-year elimination of the consumption tax on food items in response to rising inflation and potential economic repercussions from U.S. tariffs. The move is aimed at easing the financial strain on households ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections. While Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has resisted changing the consumption tax rate, other parties are also considering tax cuts to appeal to voters. The CDPJ plans to identify alternative revenue sources to offset the tax reduction, with the possibility of a one-time extension depending on economic conditions.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the U.S., China is planning targeted support measures for businesses facing economic difficulties. President Xi Jinping chaired a meeting where authorities emphasized the need for financial assistance and potential interest rate reductions to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Major Wall Street banks have already cut their China GDP forecasts for the year. Policymakers are maintaining their existing economic stance while remaining flexible to implement targeted measures, focusing on supporting specific businesses affected by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>China's assessment of coral reef degradation near Sandy Cay in the South China Sea attributes the damage to both natural factors and human activities, specifically construction and fishery activities by the Philippines on nearby Thitu Island. The report, based on satellite imagery and on-site inspections, highlights the impact of tropical cyclones and the crown-of-thorns starfish as additional factors. While the coral ecosystem at Sandy Cay is reportedly degraded, the ecology at nearby Whitsun Reef is considered generally healthy. This report underscores the ongoing tensions and environmental concerns in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales witnessed the largest increase in nearly four years during the first months of 2025, fueled by warmer weather and improved demand in March. Sales volumes rose by 1.6% between January and March, marking the most substantial growth since July 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS noted that the sunny weather in March particularly benefited garden centers, and there was increased spending on clothing and DIY products. Despite this positive trend, analysts caution that consumer confidence has declined in April, potentially weakening sales in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has ruled that Amazon Japan must pay 35 million yen in damages for failing to adequately prevent the listing of counterfeit products on its website. The case centered on the extent of Amazon Japan's responsibility to monitor listings and remove fake goods, after a medical equipment manufacturer and distributor experienced declining sales due to counterfeit pulse oximeters being sold on the platform. The court acknowledged that Amazon did not remove listings despite being notified of the availability of counterfeit products. The ruling is considered a landmark decision recognizing the obligation of online platforms to implement robust authentication systems.</p>

          <p>Konstantin Borisov, a computer engineering Ph.D., argues that the biblical Garden of Eden was located near the Great Pyramid of Giza, based on interpretations of biblical and medieval texts. Borisov identifies the Gihon River as the Nile and suggests the pyramid was built near the Tree of Eternal Life. He cites simulations showing that a blast inside the King's chamber could create an electric field resembling a tree. Borisov also connects the pyramid to the concept of a sacred mountain in ancient cultures, though most biblical scholars still locate Eden in southern Iraq near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.</p>

          <p>Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was not selected in the first round of the NFL draft, a surprising outcome considering earlier projections. Sanders' decision to decline an invitation to attend the draft proved prescient. The Jacksonville Jaguars selected Colorado's Travis Hunter, while the Green Bay Packers picked Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden. The first round saw a focus on defensive and offensive linemen, with only two quarterbacks selected overall.</p>
