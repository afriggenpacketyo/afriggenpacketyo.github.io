          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the administration's new tariff policy, stating that the rates are largely set and unlikely to be negotiated down soon. Greer explained that the President sometimes prefers a tariff over a deal to address trade deficits and encourage domestic manufacturing, even if it impacts corporate profits. The interview also covered the use of tariffs as a tool for geopolitical leverage, such as with Canada and Brazil, and ongoing trade discussions with China regarding an upcoming deadline. This article provides an in-depth look at the administration's trade philosophy directly from a key official. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than three decades after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin yogurt shop, new DNA technology is providing a potential path to solving the cold case. The article details the brutal 1991 crime and the initial investigation, which went cold before wrongful convictions were made and later overturned. The focus is on a male DNA profile found on one victim, which did not match the initial suspects, and the complex, ultimately frustrating, journey to identify its source using modern forensic techniques. Investigators remain hopeful that future scientific advancements will finally bring justice.</p>

A defense attorney highlights that while police interviewed 52 other customers from that day, these two men were never identified.

          <p>Fairfax County Public Schools Superintendent Michelle Reid is seeking to hire an 'Executive Protection Agent,' a personal bodyguard, at a salary up to $143,880, funded by taxpayers. This request comes amid her own lavish compensation package, which exceeds that of the U.S. president, and follows a tenure marked by controversies over student awards and Title IX compliance. Critics, including local parents and school safety experts, have called the move unusual and unnecessary for a school official, labeling it a demand for luxury. The school district defends the position as a formalization of existing security practices and part of a broader safety strategy.</p>

The article provides a comprehensive overview of the 1991 crime, the challenges of the initial investigation, and the long, painful journey for answers. It covers the arrests and later-overturned convictions of four men, and the pivotal role of a small sample of male DNA found at the scene that did not match the suspects.

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is facing criticism from environmental advocates for replacing a clean energy proponent on the state's powerful public services commission with an appointee seen as an industry ally. The move comes as the board, which regulates utility monopolies like DTE Energy, considers major rate increases and long-term energy plans. Campaigners allege the decision was influenced by utility giants unhappy with former board member Alessandra Carreon's stance on clean energy and rate hikes. The new appointee, Shaquila Myers, previously worked for a pro-business legislative leader, raising concerns about corporate influence over the state's ambitious clean energy transition.</p>

The author contends that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) already engages in unconstitutional actions, such as abductions and violent crackdowns on dissent, which will intensify with increased funding. The article warns that the militarization of communities, first seen in places like Los Angeles, will become widespread, ultimately affecting all Americans, not just immigrants.

The research proposes that earthquakes generate hydrogen gas from fractured rocks and water, providing the chemical energy necessary to sustain these deep-dwelling prokaryotes.

          <p>This essay reflects on the crucial but undramatic work George Washington undertook in the summer of 1775 to transform a chaotic assembly of colonial militias into the Continental Army. Despite his personal aversion to the 'dirty and nasty' New Englanders under his command, Washington established discipline, organization, and a sense of unified American identity. He appointed talented subordinates like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox based on merit, not social standing, creating a truly American force. The author argues that this quiet, foundational leadership, often overlooked in favor of dramatic battles, was essential to the success of the Revolution and demonstrates Washington's true greatness.</p>

          <p>Peter Guralnick's new biography, 'The Colonel and the King,' offers a comprehensive look at Colonel Tom Parker, the controversial longtime manager of Elvis Presley. The book delves into Parker's hidden past as an undocumented Dutch immigrant named Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk and his early life as a carnival hustler, experiences that shaped his formidable promotional skills. Rather than simply painting him as a villain who exploited Elvis, Guralnick presents a more nuanced portrait, using extensive research to contextualize Parker's decisions, including his infamous refusal to let Elvis tour internationally. The book aims to provide a definitive account of the man who built the mighty Elvis industry.</p>

          <p>In response to one of the world's highest homicide rates and a deeply corrupt police force, the new mayor of Celaya, Mexico, has fired over half of the city's officers and called in federal troops. This drastic measure reflects a broader, nearly two-decade-long trend of militarization in Mexico's security strategy, as efforts to reform local police have largely failed. The article explores the complex situation in Celaya, where cartel wars have ravaged the community and the police were seen as part of the problem. While officials report a drop in homicides, the long-term effectiveness of replacing local police with soldiers remains a contentious national debate.</p>

          <p>In California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District, voters from across the political spectrum are united in their demand for the full release of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Despite deep divisions on other issues concerning President Trump, both his supporters and detractors expressed a belief in transparency regarding the sex-trafficking case. Many voters recalled Trump's campaign promises to release the files and now view any hesitation as backpedaling. The consensus in this key political battleground suggests a broad, bipartisan expectation that the government should reveal all known information about Epstein, his crimes, and his powerful associates.</p>

          <p>A recent ruling by the Trump administration's Board of Immigration Appeals has determined that gender, or gender combined with nationality, cannot define a 'particular social group' for refugee protection. This decision effectively reverses decades of legal precedent and makes it significantly harder for women and girls to receive asylum when fleeing gender-based violence such as domestic abuse or female genital cutting. The author argues this move repudiates the principle that 'women's rights are human rights' and seeks to return refugee law to an era when such violence was dismissed as a private matter. The ruling is expected to be challenged in federal courts.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs on numerous countries, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly resilient, with Wall Street markets staying near record highs. This analysis explores the reasons, including businesses stockpiling goods, multinational corporations spreading costs globally, and investor belief that the most extreme threats will be negotiated away. However, the article warns that this stability may be temporary, as warning signs like slower GDP growth and rising consumer prices emerge. The average U.S. tariff rate is now at its highest since the 1930s, posing significant long-term risks to both the American and global economies. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Lions secured the series win, the analysis suggests it was a hard-fought victory against an underprepared Australian side, with the Lions losing four of the six halves of rugby played. The piece rates each player who appeared in more than one game, highlighting standout performers like Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry, while also noting those who struggled to find their form.

Experts suggest the eruption may be linked to a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the region last week. Shortly after the eruption, another strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit the nearby Kuril Islands, prompting tsunami warnings for parts of the peninsula. While there is no immediate threat to populated areas from the volcano, the series of seismic events highlights the geological volatility of the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'.</p>

This attack was part of a wider wave of overnight drone strikes launched by Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure in several southern Russian cities.
