          <p>A significant political conflict is unfolding between California and Texas over congressional redistricting, which could alter the balance of power in Washington D.C. After Texas Republicans passed a measure to create five new GOP-favoring seats, California's Democratic lawmakers responded with a plan to add five Democratic-leaning districts to neutralize the move. This practice, known as gerrymandering, is legal unless racially motivated, but this mid-decade arms race is highly unusual and could spread to other states ahead of the midterm elections. The outcome will have major implications for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has elevated its travel advisory for China to Level 2, "Practice Enhanced Precautions," due to an outbreak of the chikungunya virus. Spread by mosquitoes, the virus causes symptoms like fever, rash, and severe joint pain, with no specific treatment available. The CDC recommends travelers use insect repellent, wear protective clothing, and consider the chikungunya vaccine, although it advises pregnant women to reconsider travel to affected areas. The outbreak is centered in Guangdong Province, prompting an aggressive public health response from local officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb cited due process concerns, stating that the government's current procedures are insufficient for a large group of people living in the nation's interior. Previously limited to areas near the border, the policy's expansion allowed immigration officials to deport certain migrants without a court hearing. This decision represents a significant setback for the administration's immigration enforcement strategy, though it is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>The FBI has recovered bones during a two-day search operation in Washington state for Travis Decker, a fugitive accused of murdering his three young daughters. The search, involving nearly 100 personnel, took place in a heavily vegetated area near the Rock Island Campground in Leavenworth. The remains are currently being analyzed to determine if they are human. Decker has been wanted since June 2, when the bodies of his daughters, aged 5, 8, and 9, were discovered in his truck after he failed to return them from a planned visitation.</p>

          <p>Randy “Duke” Cunningham, a highly decorated Vietnam War fighter ace who later served eight terms in Congress before a major bribery scandal, has died at 83. He was celebrated as a war hero but his political career ended in disgrace when he pleaded guilty in 2005 to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors. The scandal was one of the largest in congressional history at the time, leading to an eight-year prison sentence. Cunningham, who received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump in 2021, maintained a low profile after his release.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the broad tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal law, dealing a significant blow to his trade policies. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs, calling it a core congressional power. The ruling applies to baseline tariffs on most countries and higher "reciprocal" tariffs on others, though it will not take immediate effect to allow for a potential Supreme Court appeal.

El-Fasher is the last major stronghold for the Sudanese army in Darfur, and the RSF has been accused of intensifying its offensive and deliberately targeting civilians and hospitals.

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training has caused 385 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK since January 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, making it too dangerous for crews to access the areas. This forces authorities to let fires burn out within contained areas, leading to significant smoke and pollution that affects local communities. While the MoD states it has a robust wildfire policy, some residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during dry months.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris is set to receive protection from the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked her Secret Service detail. Trump signed a memorandum ending the protection, which had been extended beyond the typical six-month period for former vice presidents by then-President Biden. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have arranged for the CHP to provide dignitary protection. The move by the Trump administration has been criticized by some as politically motivated and an act of revenge that could put the former Vice President in danger.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson gave a measured response after California Governor Gavin Newsom suggested President Trump should deploy troops to Louisiana due to its high murder rate. Appearing on Fox News, Johnson called Newsom an attention-seeker and stated that his hometown of Shreveport has been making gradual progress in reducing crime. The exchange came after Newsom criticized Trump's deployment of the National Guard to blue states, arguing that if crime suppression is the goal, the president should focus on Republican-led states like Louisiana, which has a murder rate nearly four times higher than California's.</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that prompted calls for his resignation. After the CDC chief was fired for not aligning with the president's agenda, at least three senior leaders resigned in protest of Kennedy's leadership and vaccine policies. A White House official called Kennedy "a crown jewel of this administration," while critics, including former officials and Democratic senators, have expressed alarm over his anti-vaccine history and fear his policies could undermine public health and scientific integrity.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional map, aiming to give Republicans an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. This makes Missouri the third state to engage in an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, following similar partisan moves by Republicans in Texas and Democrats in California. The proposed Missouri map specifically targets the Kansas City-area district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Democrats have condemned the move as a partisan power grab that undermines the democratic process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed it revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and undermine peace efforts as the reason for the ban. The decision is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The move, welcomed by Israel, comes as several countries plan to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state at the session.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, event planning and fashion experts are speculating about what their wedding might entail.

Fashion experts predict Swift may choose a romantic, statement-making gown from an international designer, possibly commissioning multiple dresses for the ceremony and reception. The level of public interest and media coverage is expected to be immense, rivaling that of a royal wedding.</p>

          <p>The reported plan by Coca-Cola to sell the Costa Coffee chain highlights the struggles legacy coffee brands face in attracting younger consumers. Analysts suggest that Gen Z's preference for healthier, trend-driven drinks like matcha, combined with cost-of-living pressures, has hurt chains like Costa. Newer, social media-savvy brands such as Blank Street Coffee have gained a cult following with colorful, specialty drinks. With the rise of home coffee machines, chains must now offer a unique experience or product to justify premium prices, a space where Costa is seen as struggling to compete.</p>

The incident has shocked the small community and revived national concerns about the threat posed by anti-government conspiracy theorists.

Despite these warnings, Qiao allegedly dismissed the concerns and promoted Gardner.

Despite previous efforts to reduce debt and cut costs, including furloughing pilots, the airline stated it has "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operating over the next year without this new restructuring.
