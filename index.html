          <p>The United States and Canada have missed a self-imposed deadline to forge a new trade agreement, extending a period of economic uncertainty marked by a six-month tariff war. Despite the setback, Canadian officials have indicated that talks will continue, emphasizing the need for a quality deal over a rushed one. Both nations face domestic pressure to resolve the dispute, which involves significant tariffs on key sectors like steel, aluminum, and autos. Existing trade frameworks like the CUSMA provide a buffer, allowing many Canadian goods to cross the border duty-free, which gives negotiators some breathing room. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat, an incident that also threw a passenger overboard. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center reported that the whale was first spotted alive but was confirmed dead shortly after the collision. Due to tidal conditions and the whale's location on a shallow sandbar, officials were unable to immediately access the carcass for examination. A necropsy is planned for Monday to determine the exact cause of death, and boaters in the area are being urged to use caution.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or interest rate hikes this year, though economic growth is slow. He attributed the slowdown to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's policies on trade, immigration, and regulation, which causes businesses to be cautious. Moynihan also discussed the impact of AI, noting that while it creates anxiety about future jobs, technology has historically led to more employment overall. He suggested that inflation will likely remain above the Fed's target until 2026 or 2027, prompting a cautious approach from the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Washington NFL team should restore its former "Redskins" name, framing the 2020 change as a product of "woke madness." The author contends that polls show most Native Americans are not offended by the term and that the change was part of a broader, irrational "iconoclastic impulse" to destroy historical symbols. The piece calls for a reversal of such changes, including the restoration of toppled statues, to heal from the "destruction" of 2020. The author suggests that reclaiming these names and monuments is a necessary step to reassert respect for the past over modern sensibilities.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the data revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, suggesting the administration wants "its own people" to ensure data transparency. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists, who fear it could undermine public trust in the independence and credibility of crucial government economic data. McEntarfer's ouster came after Trump claimed the jobs numbers were being manipulated for political purposes.</p>

Police reported that the girl was very hot but appeared otherwise unharmed and was taken to a hospital for medical assessment. The woman has been charged with the ill-treatment and neglect of a child. Authorities commended the bus driver for his immediate action, which they believe prevented a potentially tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>Victims of mis-sold car finance in the UK are expected to receive less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The proposal follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, did deem exceptionally large commissions to be unfair. The FCA will now consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The first payouts are anticipated next year, with the industry expected to cover the full cost of the program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are increasingly adding spicy menu items to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha diners, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. This strategy is seen as a low-cost, high-return way to generate buzz and drive sales amid a general pullback in consumer spending. Fueled by social media trends on platforms like TikTok, these limited-time offers and spicy collaborations are becoming a key marketing tool. While effective, the challenge for brands is the fleeting nature of these trends, as younger consumers quickly move on to new flavor profiles.</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has plummeted to a historic low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking concerns about the country's future prosperity and social systems. The decline is attributed to multiple factors, including economic uncertainty, climate change anxiety, and a societal shift where having children is increasingly seen as a financial and personal burden, particularly for women. While some on the far-right call for pronatalist policies, sociologists argue the focus should be on bridging the "fertility gap"—the difference between the number of children people desire and the number they actually have. Improving family-friendly policies is seen as key to reversing the trend.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone before it enters service. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV showed a control room operator clearing a position for take-off, suggesting a successful drill. This marks a significant step for the Fujian, which is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy. The advanced system allows for the launch of heavier and more varied aircraft, greatly enhancing the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army Navy.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling speeches and factually incorrect claims, have renewed questions about his mental acuity. Experts cited in the article point to instances of him digressing into unrelated topics, such as a lengthy, unprompted rant against windmills, and confabulating stories, like a false claim about his uncle and the Unabomber. While the White House and its allies aggressively defend the president's sharpness, some mental health professionals express concern over what they describe as a noticeable deterioration in his verbal coherence and ability to maintain a consistent narrative.</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Offer Advice on Protecting Finances During a Marriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To protect personal finances within a marriage, especially if it becomes unstable, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies. The first is to maintain full awareness and access to all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities, ensuring transparency and preventing surprises later. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which, like a prenup, defines how assets would be divided in a divorce. This can be particularly useful if one spouse starts a business during the marriage. While discussing a postnup can be difficult, attorneys advise that avoiding such conversations can lead to greater conflict in the long run.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified the best U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential, with mid-sized metro areas like Raleigh, Nashville, and Austin topping the list. The study, conducted by HR technology company Checkr, ranked cities based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. The findings suggest a shift in the "geography of opportunity," as these growing hubs in technology, healthcare, and finance offer strong job markets. They often boast a more affordable cost of living compared to traditional coastal megacities like New York and Los Angeles, which did not make the top 10. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert in child development suggests that parents can more effectively handle tantrums by using specific calming and validating phrases instead of resorting to punishment. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood, which de-escalates their distress. The approach emphasizes connection over control, reassuring the child that their emotions are acceptable even if certain behaviors are not. By validating feelings and setting compassionate boundaries, parents can help their children regulate their nervous systems and build emotional resilience over time.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical treatment in the UK. While the exact number is unclear, the plan could reportedly allow up to 300 children, each with a guardian, to enter the country for free medical care. This move follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report that the government had previously declined to support such an evacuation scheme. The initiative aims to provide specialized care unavailable in Gaza, where the healthcare system has been devastated by the ongoing conflict.</p>

The event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake in April that was felt by millions.

Instead of treating these as shocking aberrations, society must recognize the pervasive pattern that affects all women, shaping their choices and limiting their freedom. The article calls for a broader conversation and deep social change to address the root causes, rather than just reacting to individual criminal cases.</p>

Financial planners cited in the article view this as a healthy approach, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and cash flow is often more productive than fixating on a net worth figure.
