          <p>An attack occurred at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. A suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails, injuring eight people. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of violence and potential terrorism, with Soliman reportedly yelling "free Palestine" during the attack. Victims included four women and four men aged 52 to 88, with one in critical condition and authorities are investigating the incident as a potential hate crime.</p>

          <p>Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki, who was supported by Donald Trump. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, previously led the Institute of National Remembrance and has been critical of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. His victory could complicate Prime Minister Donald Tusk's efforts to advance his agenda, as Nawrocki holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association (JSA) at a press conference on June 9. Multiple association sources indicate that the Mongolian-born 40-year-old, now known as elder Miyagino, will leave amid uncertainty surrounding his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho physically abused two junior wrestlers. Hakuho, a record-holding champion, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>
