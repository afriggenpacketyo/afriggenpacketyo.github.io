        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details a hypothetical scenario 200 days into a second Donald Trump presidency, where actions perceived as authoritarian are escalating. It cites examples such as demands to prosecute political opponents, firings of government officials, and efforts to control federal agencies and cultural institutions. Critics and political analysts quoted in the article express growing concern that the foundations of U.S. democracy are being systematically undermined at a faster pace than in his first term. The piece suggests these moves are part of a deliberate strategy to consolidate power and reshape the nation's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have engaged in significant overnight drone exchanges, with both sides reporting numerous attacks and defensive actions. Ukraine's air force stated Russia launched 100 drones, while Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have downed at least 126 Ukrainian drones, causing at least one fatality in Saratov. These military actions occur as diplomatic efforts intensify ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian officials insist on their inclusion in any negotiations and reject ceding territory, setting a tense backdrop for the high-stakes talks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of demonstrators, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have protested across Israel against the government's plan to expand its military operation. Protesters fear the strategy endangers the lives of the remaining hostages and are demanding a deal for their release, even if it means ending the war. The movement includes a group of over 350 soldiers who are now refusing to serve in what they term a "political war." This internal dissent adds pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faces opposition from military leaders concerned that a full occupation of Gaza would be a strategic trap.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to convene an emergency session to address Israel's plan to expand its military operations and reoccupy Gaza City. The proposal has drawn widespread international condemnation, with several European nations and the UN chief labeling it a dangerous escalation. In response, Germany has announced a halt to military exports to Israel intended for use in Gaza. The article also notes a new poll indicating a majority of Germans now support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state, reflecting shifting public sentiment in Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing numerous asylum applications, some filed years ago, because the applicants did not undergo a mandatory "credible fear" interview upon entering the U.S. This procedural issue, often caused by a shortage of asylum officers during peak immigration periods, forces individuals who have been living and working legally to restart the complex process. Immigration lawyers express concern that this retroactive policy makes documented people undocumented, revokes their work permits, and exposes them to a higher risk of detention and deportation. The move is seen as part of a broader effort to tighten immigration controls.</p>

This significant shift in weather follows Storm Floris and is caused by warm air being drawn up from the south. While England and Wales will experience the most sunshine, the forecast also includes the possibility of scattered thunderstorms, and pollen levels are expected to be high.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new ferry connections. Turkish tourists are drawn by the relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish holiday destinations. This cultural exchange is fostering positive relations on a personal level, as local Greek business owners welcome the friendly and appreciative guests. However, the article notes that this grassroots goodwill exists alongside persistent, high-level political disputes between Athens and Ankara over maritime borders and airspace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in Beijing, led by Gao Caixia at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has developed a new genome-editing technology that significantly improves the ability to manipulate large DNA fragments. This new system, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), makes the process more efficient and easier to use in higher organisms like plants. The breakthrough is expected to accelerate advancements in crop improvement by altering genetic traits for better yields or resilience. It could also have significant implications for treating genetic diseases and developing artificial chromosomes for synthetic biology applications.</p>

          <p>The passion of young people, particularly Gen Z, for live theater and performances is reshaping and driving Shanghai's nighttime economy. Instead of traditional nightlife, many are spending their evenings and money on shows and related activities, fostering a vibrant cultural scene. The Shanghai city government is actively supporting this trend through its "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to streamline approvals for nighttime events and enrich cultural offerings. This focus on boosting consumption is part of a broader strategy to stimulate domestic demand and counteract economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement emphasizing that any peace talks must involve Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others stressed that "international borders must not be changed by force" and that Kyiv must have a say in its own destiny. The statement comes after Trump suggested a potential deal could involve "swapping of territories," a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly rejected.

He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While hardware like dexterous hands is advancing, Wang states that the crucial element of "AI for embodied intelligence" is still inadequate. He suggests that generative models that create interactive simulations for robots to follow might be a more promising path than current vision-language models.</p>

          <p>The murder of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old nurse in Minnesota, was solved after investigators discovered a crucial piece of evidence that contradicted the suspect's story. Matthew Ecker, a colleague who was with Pennig, claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. However, detectives found a small, circular metal part of the door lock underneath Pennig's body. This discovery indicated that the door had been forcibly broken open before she was shot, suggesting Ecker had broken in and then killed her. This key finding led to Ecker's conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. The interruption, affecting about 9,200 households, began when a critical water control valve broke, complicated by a regional heatwave. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in the system and delaying complex repairs on the broken valve, which is located 20 feet underground. The situation was exacerbated when a temporary bypass pipe failed, further pushing back the timeline for full restoration.</p>
