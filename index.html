          <p>Many young Russian men have been avoiding service in the war against Ukraine, but some are signing up for short stints in a drone brigade called Kaskad, which offers a career boost to politically minded recruits. Based in an undisclosed location in occupied Ukraine, this "V.I.P. unit" allows officials to sidestep statutory military service requirements while currying favor with the Kremlin. Recruits typically stay for three to eight months, take photo opportunities with weapons, and return home with a hero's welcome. This practice is viewed as gaming President Putin's call to promote veterans to leadership roles, as those in Kaskad experience safer and more comfortable conditions compared to frontline units, living in apartments or hotels rather than trenches.</p>

          <p>The new Syrian government has agreed to assist the United States in locating and returning Americans who went missing in the war-torn country, signaling improved relations between the two nations. This agreement followed a meeting between U.S. envoy Thomas Barrack and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa during the latter's visit to Turkey. The Syrian government will aid the U.S. in honoring the remains of those who died there and bringing home those who went missing. The Trump administration has also granted Syria exemptions from sanctions, aiming to help the new government create better conditions for the Syrian people and defeat ISIS.</p>

          <p>During a Southern Conference tournament game, a Samford player's exuberant home run celebration led to a Mercer team walk-off. Michael Gupton's taunting behavior after hitting a home run caused displeasure among Mercer players and coaches, resulting in the ejection of Gupton, Mercer shortstop Bradley Frye, and two coaches. Frye's mother was also ejected after jumping on the dugout roof. The game was paused for nearly 30 minutes due to the disturbance, and the Southern Conference commissioner had to intervene. Samford ultimately won the game, advancing to the Southern Conference championship.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest drone and missile barrages on Ukraine, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones, with Ukrainian forces intercepting approximately two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all of the drones. This recent escalation in violence comes despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations, with civilian deaths in Ukraine having risen each month since February. The Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, called for increased pressure on Putin and accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion piece criticizes Jake Tapper of CNN for relying on insider sources to report on Joe Biden's fitness for office, arguing that Tapper ignored what was evident to observers. The author contends that Tapper and his colleagues were deceived by their sources, who are now attempting to rewrite history to portray themselves in a better light. The opinion piece suggests that journalism often prioritizes sourcing over accurate reporting and analysis of known facts, resulting in a lack of public trust. The author suggests that Trump is more forthright than Biden, and journalism should return to dealing in reality, not speculation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is again targeting Harvard University after a judge blocked his administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of Harvard's international students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." The administration wants to know who these students are, but Trump says "Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming." This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the revocation, which Harvard argued was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment."</p>

Parsons described the administration's orders as attempts to indoctrinate, not educate, and said his research agenda was effectively banned.

Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri all followed a similar strategy, starting on medium tires and then switching to two stints on hard tires.

          <p>President Trump and his family have monetized the White House to an unprecedented degree, normalizing activities that once would have triggered outrage and investigations. The Trump family and its business partners have collected millions through various ventures, including cryptocurrency fees, overseas real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. Qatar also gifted a luxury jet for Mr. Trump‚Äôs use. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled accountability measures, leading to a lack of official review of his activities. While some pushback has emerged, Democrats are divided on how much to focus on Trump's profitmaking, with some preferring to concentrate on economic issues.</p>

As of Friday morning, the National Interagency Fire Center reports the Minnesota fires now cover about 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused," though the investigation is still in progress. The Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained, while the Eastern Area Complex Incident Team has command of the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires.

The Israeli military stated that it had "struck a number of suspects" in a structure near Israeli forces in Khan Younis but was still checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." The Najjars had stayed in their home despite evacuation orders, feeling that they could not move their 10 children into a crowded tent camp without any services.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party cannot guarantee that train tickets will get cheaper under renationalisation, as South Western Railway (SWR) was brought into public ownership on Sunday. While Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she "would love to be able" to promise lower fares, she said the day-to-day running of trains was already heavily subsidised by the taxpayer. The focus will instead be on improving services and infrastructure, she said. The first service by the renationlised SWR departed at 05:36 on Sunday from Woking to Surbiton. Some members of the public questioned the point of renationalising train operators if it did not reduce prices.</p>

He argues that this will damage research programs, destroy the careers of young scientists, and potentially lead to a "brain drain" of researchers finding positions in other countries. Dr. Johnson emphasizes the importance of government support for medical research and questions why politicians aren't advocating for a more targeted approach to savings.</p>
