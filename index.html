          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology disruption, leading to a nationwide ground stop for several hours that affected its major hubs, including Chicago, Denver, and Newark. The problem, which was not cybersecurity-related, caused extensive delays and stranded thousands of passengers across the country. The airline has since resolved the underlying issue and is working to restore normal operations, confirming it will cover customer expenses for what it has classified as a preventable delay.</p>

Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by numerous aircraft, are battling the blaze, which officials describe as the largest in the region in nearly 80 years.

          <p>China's trade data for July revealed stronger-than-expected economic performance, with exports rising by 7.2% in U.S. dollar terms compared to the previous year. This figure significantly surpassed economists' predictions of a 5.4% increase, indicating resilient global demand for Chinese goods. Furthermore, imports experienced their largest jump in a year, growing by 4.1% and confounding forecasts of a decline, which suggests a potential strengthening of domestic demand.

The tactic involved agents emerging from the back of the truck after the driver offered work, creating chaos and raising concerns about the methods used for immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Singer Kelly Clarkson has announced the postponement of the remaining August dates for her Las Vegas residency, citing a family medical issue. In a public statement, Clarkson explained that her ex-husband and the father of her children, Brandon Blackstock, has been ill, and she needs to be fully present for her family at this time. This follows an earlier postponement of the residency's opening nights in July, which was attributed to vocal strain from rehearsals.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move likely to raise costs for a wide range of consumer electronics and vehicles. However, the tariff would not apply to companies that are currently building or have committed to building manufacturing facilities within the United States. This policy marks a significant shift from the subsidy-based approach of the CHIPS Act, instead using punitive measures to incentivize domestic production.</p>

She also highlighted an "uncertainty tax" weighing on businesses as they navigate tariff impacts and macroeconomic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the timeline of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) jobs reports contradicts President Trump's claims used to justify firing Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Trump alleged the agency released inflated job numbers before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but a major downward revision occurred in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to criticize his opponent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a multibillion-dollar blow to India's economy, though the overall impact may be moderated by exemptions for key sectors. While sectors like gems, jewellery, and textiles are considered most vulnerable, crucial exports such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted. The 21-day window before the new tariffs take effect may provide an opportunity for negotiation, but the move creates significant uncertainty for U.S.-India trade relations.

This flexibility is attributed to universities seeking financial stability by enrolling more domestic undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student numbers. With tuition fees for UK students rising for the first time since 2017, universities are reportedly keen to fill their courses.</p>
