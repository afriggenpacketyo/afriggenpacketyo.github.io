          <p>The National Crime Agency (NCA) is taking over the investigation into claims that South Yorkshire Police officers sexually abused children in Rotherham during the 1990s and early 2000s. This decision follows calls for transparency, as the force was initially investigating its own former officers. Five women, who were victims of grooming gangs, alleged they were also subjected to sexual assault by police. The NCA's Operation Stovewood, which already handles historical child sexual abuse cases in Rotherham, will now lead the inquiry to ensure victims remain central to the investigation and to encourage others to come forward without fear.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, is spreading rapidly northwest of Los Angeles, forcing mandatory evacuations for over 2,700 residents and warnings for another 14,000. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the fire grew from 30 to nearly 5,000 acres overnight and remains 0% contained. Firefighting efforts are challenged by forecasted temperatures reaching 100°F. This event is part of a broader trend of more frequent and destructive wildfire seasons in California, which experts attribute to climate change, highlighting the state's ongoing vulnerability to such disasters.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Pretoria has ruled that the remains of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu must be returned to Zambia for a state funeral, overriding his family's wishes to bury him in South Africa. Lungu, who died while receiving medical treatment, had a contentious relationship with his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, leading his family to oppose a state-sponsored ceremony. The court determined that a state's right to honor a former leader with a state funeral supersedes the family's personal preferences, ordering the body to be surrendered to Zambian authorities for repatriation.</p>

          <p>UK fashion retailer River Island has received High Court approval for a restructuring plan to prevent insolvency, which includes closing 33 stores and reducing rent at 71 others. The company cited a shift to online shopping and rising operational costs for its financial difficulties, warning it could have run out of cash by the end of August without the deal. The plan also involves making about 110 head office roles redundant. While this move saves the company from immediate collapse, analysts caution that River Island must now focus on revitalizing its brand to attract consumers.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted the six individuals arrested for a widely publicized beating in downtown Cincinnati, bringing new charges against them, including felonious assault and aggravated rioting. The incident, captured on video, showed a man being violently attacked after reportedly yelling racial slurs, and a woman being knocked unconscious. The case has sparked a national debate about public safety, police presence, and bail policies in the city. Hamilton County's prosecutor stated the charges are meant to hold those involved accountable for the violence, with the suspects now facing up to 29.5 years in prison if convicted.</p>

The partnership will now shift focus from tourism promotion to football development through a youth academy in Kigali. The move comes after an open letter from DR Congo's foreign minister urged Bayern, Arsenal, and PSG to sever their "blood-stained sponsorship deals." While the commercial aspect is gone, the contract's 2028 end date remains, and the club has already secured a new sponsorship with Emirates.</p>

          <p>The advocacy organization Democracy Forward has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice and the FBI, seeking the release of records related to the government's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The suit, filed under the Freedom of Information Act, specifically requests communications from senior administration officials about Epstein documents, including any correspondence between Epstein and Donald Trump. This legal action follows the DOJ's recent statement that it would not release additional files, a decision that has drawn criticism and prompted a House Oversight Committee subpoena for the same records.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been convicted of murdering his classmate, Harvey Willgoose, by stabbing him in the heart with a hunting knife during a lunch break at a Sheffield school. The attack followed a dispute between the two teenagers over social media. The defendant, who cannot be named, had admitted to manslaughter and possession of a knife but denied murder, claiming he had "lost control." The jury delivered a majority guilty verdict after a month-long trial. Following the verdict, Harvey's family expressed their devastation and called for action against knife crime to ensure a safer future.</p>

          <p>Robert Gordon, the former Michigan health director who implemented the state's Medicaid work requirements in 2020, is warning that a new federal law expanding these mandates will be catastrophic. He recounts how, despite a $30 million effort to implement the system as smoothly as possible, it was still on track to disenroll up to 100,000 people before a court blocked it. With the new law affecting 18 million people across 40 states, Gordon argues that such systems inevitably cause massive coverage losses due to bureaucratic hurdles, not because people aren't eligible, calling the policy "wasteful" and "incredibly harmful."</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights chief, Volker Türk, has strongly condemned Israel's plan to take military control of Gaza City, demanding it be "immediately halted." He warned the escalation would result in "massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering... and atrocity crimes." The plan has also drawn criticism from other world leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and German Chancellor, with Germany suspending exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza. The families of Israeli hostages also condemned the decision, calling it a "colossal catastrophe."</p>

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, noting that top accounts offer returns that outpace inflation, making them an attractive savings vehicle. While national average yields for 1-year and 5-year CDs are around 1.70% to 2.03%, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.40% APY. The report notes the existence of an "inverted yield curve," where short-term CDs currently offer better rates than long-term ones. It suggests savers look to online banks and consider laddering CDs to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 10 people have died and 33 are missing following severe flash floods in Gansu province in northwestern China. The disaster was triggered by continuous heavy rainfall, which also knocked out power and communication services, stranding over 4,000 people in four villages. President Xi Jinping has called for an "utmost effort" in the rescue operations and urged regions to be vigilant against extreme weather events. The incident is part of a pattern of frequent natural disasters in China during the summer, which scientists link to the effects of climate change.</p>

          <p>A recent constitutional amendment in Togo has allowed President Faure Gnassingbe to transition to a new, unelected role as "president of the Council of Ministers," retaining most presidential powers while a ceremonial president serves as head of state. Critics and opposition activists have labeled this a "constitutional coup," as it could allow Gnassingbe, whose family has ruled for 58 years, to remain in power indefinitely without facing a direct election. Observers fear this maneuver could become a blueprint for other authoritarian leaders in Africa who wish to cement their power and bypass democratic processes.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old who had both of his lower legs amputated after a crash caused by a drunk driver says he will "never forgive" the man responsible. The teenager, a promising footballer named Adam Golebiewski, was a passenger when 19-year-old Arran Paterson crashed his car in Aberdeenshire last year. Paterson pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving over the limit. Golebiewski, who walked into court on prosthetic legs after months of rehabilitation, expressed his anger over the life-altering incident but also his determination to "enjoy life again and stay positive," supported by his family and friends.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved a controversial plan to establish military control over Gaza City, the most populous city in the Gaza Strip before the war. The plan outlines five principles for ending the conflict, including disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, and establishing an alternative civil administration. The move has been condemned by world leaders and the UN, who warn of a humanitarian catastrophe, and faces strong opposition within Israel from military officials and hostage families. While a timeline has not been given, the plan signals a major escalation in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found compelling new evidence of a large gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet is similar to Jupiter or Saturn and orbits a star much like our Sun. Although the gas giant itself would be uninhabitable, it could possess rocky moons capable of sustaining life, making the discovery particularly exciting. The planet was briefly detected last year before disappearing from view, and astronomers must now conduct follow-up observations to definitively confirm its existence.</p>

          <p>A new Emerson College poll reveals that a large portion of California's electorate remains undecided about the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial primary, 38% of registered voters are undecided, with former Rep. Katie Porter leading the declared candidates at 18%. Regarding a proposed special election on redistricting, which Democrats are considering to counter GOP efforts in other states, 42% of voters were unsure.
