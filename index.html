          <p>The German Interior Ministry announced that 1,337 Syrians living in Germany have voluntarily returned to their home country since President Bashar Assad was deposed in December last year. This data, collected through July, comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasizes reducing immigration and increasing deportations. The German government has encouraged voluntary returns by allowing refugees to visit Syria without losing protected status, aiming to enable informed decisions. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is also pursuing deportations, initially targeting convicted criminals, amidst ongoing debate about Syria's security situation.</p>

This expansion, tested last year in Phoenix, aims to integrate grocery shopping with general online browsing, encouraging first-time Amazon grocery customers who now shop twice as often. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25. Competitors like Instacart, Kroger, Albertsons, and Walmart saw their stock prices fall following the announcement, as Amazon continues to retool its grocery business and integrate Whole Foods.</p>

The company, known for its ear piercing services and appeal to tweens, has struggled with declining sales and intense competition, exacerbated by a shift away from brick-and-mortar retail and debt obligations. This move follows its bankruptcy filing in the U.S. earlier this month. All outlets are expected to continue trading while administrators explore options, including a potential sale to secure the brand's future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of California and the federal government are clashing in court over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. California argues the deployment, intended to protect federal property during protests, is an illegal "power grab" violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Federal lawyers contend the deployment is legal and for protective purposes, denying any violation. The case highlights a broader debate on presidential authority in deploying military forces domestically, with implications for potential future deployments in other cities.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to redraw congressional maps, stating the move is intended to "END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY" and enable Democrats to regain control of the U.S. House. This initiative comes in response to Texas Republicans' efforts to redraw their own maps in their party's favor, sparking a national redistricting battle with significant implications for the U.S. House. Newsom's proposal could potentially cut several GOP-held seats in California. The state legislature is expected to release draft maps soon, with Newsom indicating he might consider a special election for their approval.</p>

Jones, 82, credited a "fabulous treatment" and a "miracle drug" called PD-1 therapy for his recovery, stating he now has no tumors. He has undergone four surgeries over the past decade related to his lungs and lymph nodes. Melanoma is a dangerous form of skin cancer due to its high likelihood of spreading.

The office manager's accidental discovery of the package and a staff member's subsequent Google search connecting Angela's symptoms to cyanide poisoning prompted a call to police.

          <p>A new report from Zety, a career platform, indicates that laid-off American workers are facing significant struggles in the current job market. The survey found that over half of laid-off workers submitted more than 50 applications, and one in five submitted over 100, before securing a new role. More than 30% remained unemployed for over 90 days, despite starting their job search quickly. Obstacles include vague job listings, slow timelines, increased competition, and lower salary offers. Many workers are relying on savings, credit cards, or government aid, leading to financial instability and lingering anxiety about future job security.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police's investigation into how it handled historical allegations against former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed has received reports from 146 individuals, more than doubling previous figures. The allegations include sexual assault, with the police also examining whether others enabled his behavior. The force is collaborating with international agencies, acknowledging the investigation's complexity due to the volume of survivors coming forward. Harrods has initiated a compensation scheme for victims, offering up to £385,000, following a BBC documentary, "Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods," which brought the extent of his alleged predatory actions to light.</p>

          <p>Gianluigi Donnarumma's career at Paris Saint-Germain appears to be ending after his exclusion from the Uefa Super Cup final squad, following PSG's signing of Lucas Chevalier. While Manchester City sources dismiss current talks as speculation, they haven't ruled out a move if their current goalkeeper, Ederson, departs. PSG reportedly sought a "different profile" of goalkeeper despite Donnarumma offering a salary reduction. The Italian international's passing accuracy is strong, but his save percentage has been noted. Donnarumma's situation could change by month-end, especially if Ederson's contract situation or potential transfer to Galatasaray evolves.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage applications have dropped as prospective homebuyers await potential September rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, but experts caution against common mistakes during this period of economic uncertainty. Key advice includes avoiding job changes before loan approval, as stability is crucial for underwriting, and refraining from opening new loans or lines of credit, which can negatively impact credit scores and debt-to-income ratios. Skipping mortgage preapproval is also warned against, as it can hinder competitiveness and prevent early identification of financial issues. Buyers should also understand that Fed rate cuts do not guarantee significantly lower mortgage payments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, marking the lowest percentage in nearly 90 years. This decline is largely attributed to a growing belief that even moderate alcohol consumption poses health risks, with 53% of adults now holding this view, up significantly from 28% in 2015. Younger adults are leading this shift in perception, though older adults are also increasingly recognizing the risks. The findings indicate a broader trend of reduced consumption even among those who drink, influenced by evolving scientific consensus on alcohol's negative health outcomes, including its link to cancer.</p>

          <p>Cava's stock plunged nearly 20% after the restaurant company lowered its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth due to a disappointing second quarter. While Cava's net restaurant sales climbed 20% due to new openings, its same-store sales grew only 2.1%, significantly below Wall Street's 6.1% projection. The company's CFO attributed the slowdown to the one-year anniversary of its grilled steak launch, which had previously boosted traffic. This performance mirrors struggles seen by rival fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, which have also reported sales declines.

          <p>Federal investigators have charged 13 individuals in connection with a "cruel and malicious" grandparent scam that defrauded hundreds of elderly victims of over $5 million. The investigation was initiated after Uber's Global Security team flagged suspicious activity involving their drivers, who were unknowingly used as "runners" to collect cash from victims. Organized call centers in the Dominican Republic allegedly targeted elderly individuals by impersonating grandchildren in distress or lawyers demanding bail money. U.S. Attorney Leah Foley stated that victims, with an average age of 84, are unlikely to recover their money. Uber has since updated driver training to prevent similar incidents.</p>

Philp was investigating the illegal migration crisis, which has seen over 170,000 people cross the English Channel in small boats since 2018. The incident highlights the volatile conditions in these camps. The Labour government has implemented a 'one-in, one-out' agreement with France to return some arrivals, a policy Philp criticizes for replacing the scrapped Rwanda plan.

These tiny plastic fragments, originating from agricultural films, tires, and clothing fibers, enter soil and plant cells, affecting water movement and nutrient breakdown.
