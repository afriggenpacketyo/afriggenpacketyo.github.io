          <p>Despite low approval among Ukrainians, President Trump's recent meeting with President Zelenskyy has offered a small measure of hope. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks, hinting at a potential shift in his approach. This contrasts with previous concerns that Trump would force Ukraine into a lopsided peace deal favoring Russia. The meeting follows a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, which prompted a rare rebuke of Putin from Trump.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that President Trump's first 100 days have been marked by significant changes, but also concerns about his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices. While he maintains support from his base, disapproval is growing among others who believe he is not prioritizing lowering prices. The poll also shows that most Americans think Trump is already making major changes to how the government and economy work. The economy and immigration top the list of issues voters are using to judge the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister reports "a bit of progress" in efforts to broker a new ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, but acknowledges there is still no "answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war." Hamas appears more receptive to negotiating a lasting solution, suggesting it could disarm if Israel withdraws from Gaza. Fighting between Hamas and Israel has intensified, and the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says 2,151 Palestinians have been killed since the renewed offensive began. A Palestinian official familiar with negotiations told the BBC that Hamas has signaled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon "at the national and regional level".</p>

What began as a sprawling effort to throw out 65,000 votes from the state’s Supreme Court election in November has shrunk to a legal skirmish over a small fraction of those ballots. The battle may have sketched a blueprint for overturning future elections. Federal and state judges have shown a willingness to entertain Republican challenges of votes in Democratic-leaning areas that focused on technicalities and sought to reinterpret voting laws long after Election Day.</p>
