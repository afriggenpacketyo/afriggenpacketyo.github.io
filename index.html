          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza reports over 60,000 people have been killed since October 2023, including many women and children, with numerous fatalities occurring during aid attempts. Israel disputes these figures and states it targets "terror targets" while taking steps to mitigate civilian harm. The UN warns of famine playing out in Gaza, contradicting Israeli claims of no humanitarian catastrophe. International journalists cannot independently verify figures due to Israeli restrictions on entry, making it difficult to confirm the reported numbers.</p>

          <h2>EPA Proposes Revoking Key Greenhouse Gas Regulation Finding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 15:31:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," which served as the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin calls this the "largest deregulatory action in history," claiming it will save Americans $54 billion annually by repealing related regulations. Critics, including former EPA officials and environmental experts, argue the move disregards scientific consensus on climate change and public health, warning of severe environmental consequences and potential legal challenges. The EPA's own report suggests limiting emissions generates trillions in net benefits over 30 years.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is predicted by some experts to disproportionately benefit the U.S., raising tariffs on EU imports to 17.5% while U.S. exports to the EU face no tariffs. Economists at Société Générale call it "asymmetric and unbalanced," forecasting a 0.2% reduction in the EU's annual GDP. Despite concerns from European industries like winemakers and automakers about increased costs, the deal is seen by some as reducing uncertainty and potentially paving the way for future agreements, offering a better outcome than a full trade war.

The article highlights that while investors are wary of the acquisition's hefty price, the current deregulatory administration might favor such large deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Many arrive with nothing, and women face a restrictive government banning work and education. The UNHCR anticipates 3 million returns by year-end, intensifying the crisis.</p>

          <p>Credit card interest rates are not expected to fall following the Federal Reserve's July meeting, as a rate cut is highly improbable. Even if a cut occurs, its impact on credit card rates would be negligible due to their linkage to the prime rate. With average credit card debt around $8,000 and compounding interest, borrowers are advised to explore debt relief options. These include debt settlement, which can reduce balances by 30-50%, debt management programs, or debt consolidation loans, which offer significantly lower interest rates than credit cards.

          <p>California and a coalition of liberal-led states have sued the Trump administration over a provision in the "Big Beautiful Bill" that bars Planned Parenthood and other large non-profit abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding for unrelated healthcare services.
