        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting reveal widespread concerns among officials regarding the labor market and persistent inflation, though most favored maintaining current interest rates. A significant divergence emerged, with two governors dissenting in favor of rate cuts, marking the first time multiple governors voted against a rate decision in over 30 years. Policymakers noted rising economic threats, particularly the uncertain effects of President Trump's tariffs and the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Some also worried about weakening labor market conditions. The Fed awaits Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole address for further policy direction, as the central bank navigates these complex economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As GCSE results day approaches, a debate is ongoing among students, parents, and experts about whether cash rewards or gifts effectively motivate teenagers to achieve higher exam grades. While some parents offer financial incentives, believing it encourages more study time, students like Imogen Farmer suggest such rewards might not significantly alter effort if ambition is already present. Psychologists like Natasha Tiwari argue that rewarding effort rather than just grades fosters a more sustainable learning approach, cautioning that large monetary treats risk making achievements feel "transactional." Experts emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation and parental involvement over financial inducements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of President Trump's Federal Housing Finance Agency, has publicly demanded the resignation or firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Pulte claims Cook simultaneously designated two different properties as her primary residence to secure more favorable loan terms, a practice he deems illegal. This accusation, echoed by Trump, intensifies the administration's pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and broadens its focus beyond Chairman Jerome Powell. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating, but the Fed and DOJ have declined comment on Pulte's claims.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025 and currently a Category 2 storm, is churning off the Atlantic coast, prompting mandatory evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Although not expected to make direct U.S. landfall, its unusually large size means tropical-storm-force winds extend hundreds of miles from its center, bringing life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast. North Carolina Governor Josh Stein urged residents to heed warnings and prepare disaster bags, as coastal flooding from massive waves and storm surge are anticipated from Wednesday evening through Thursday. Dangerous ocean conditions are expected to persist for much of the week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has rejected the U.S. government's request to unseal specific grand jury materials in the Jeffrey Epstein case, stating prosecutors failed to demonstrate "special circumstances" for disclosure. Judge Richard Berman noted the material was minimal, consisting primarily of hearsay testimony from a single FBI agent, and paled in comparison to the extensive "Epstein Files" already held by the Justice Department. The decision comes amid increasing public and congressional pressure for greater transparency regarding Epstein, but the judge cited "possible threats to victims' safety and privacy" as a factor against releasing these particular documents.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is facing an ethics complaint filed by the government watchdog group Democracy Restored, urging the Arkansas state bar to investigate her conduct during the 2016 presidential campaign. The complaint cites recently declassified documents, alleging Clinton approved a plan to release false information to "smear" her political opponent and divert attention from her own legal issues. Democracy Restored contends that her campaign elevated "unverified" intelligence, violating ethical norms for attorneys. The Arkansas Supreme Court Office of Professional Conduct has confirmed receipt of the grievance, indicating the start of a formal review process.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were met with boos and jeers from protesters during a photo opportunity with National Guard troops at Union Station in Washington, D.C. The officials visited to thank the guardsmen and bought them lunch, but their press gaggle was largely drowned out by chants of "Free DC." Vance and Miller dismissed the protesters as "crazy" and "communists." Vance defended the troop deployment, claiming the station was overrun with homeless people and unsafe, but declined to provide supporting evidence.</p>

          <p>Grants Pass, Oregon, a city recently at the center of a major U.S. Supreme Court homelessness ruling, has settled a lawsuit with Disability Rights Oregon.

          <p>Intel is reportedly in talks with other large investors to secure an equity infusion at a discounted price, following a recent $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank. This financial push comes as the chipmaker attempts a turnaround after years of declining sales and shrinking market share, struggling to fully capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the U.S. government seeks an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, adding a layer of government influence to the company's financial strategy. Intel recently overhauled its leadership, including appointing a new CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A resident in the South Lake Tahoe area of California has tested positive for plague, believed to have been contracted from an infected flea bite while camping. El Dorado County Public Health officials confirmed the case, noting the individual is recovering at home under medical care. Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, is typically spread by fleas from wild rodents like squirrels and chipmunks, and while rare, it can be serious but is treatable with antibiotics if detected early. This is the county's first human case since 2020, prompting officials to advise precautions for outdoor activities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively restructuring the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), signaling a significant shift towards less federal funding for disaster relief. President Trump stated that aid would be reduced and distributed directly from his office, despite FEMA currently managing hundreds of open disaster declarations, some dating back nearly two decades. Critics warn these cuts will impose a heavier financial burden on state and local governments, as exemplified by North Carolina's recovery from Hurricane Helene, where federal funds covered only a small fraction of the total damages.
