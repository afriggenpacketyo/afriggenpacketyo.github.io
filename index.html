          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:56:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow explores the life of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. This excerpt from the book details Twain's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey undertaken to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain reflects on the changes to the river and its towns, the decline of the steamboat era, and the profound, nostalgic joy he felt being back in a pilot house. He considered it the only place of true freedom he had ever known, a sanctuary from the world's constraints.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Severe flash floods have struck the Texas Hill Country, leading to what officials are calling a "mass casualty event" with at least 27 confirmed deaths, including nine children. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise in the middle of the night. Hundreds of people have been rescued, many by air, but dozens remain missing, including a group of children from the nearby Camp Mystic summer camp. A disaster declaration has been signed as search and rescue operations continue amid concerns of more rain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography was published 100 years after his passing, revealing his unfiltered thoughts on society, politics, and personal matters. The work was dictated rather than written, creating a blog-like, non-linear narrative where Twain could speak freely, knowing the subjects of his criticism would not be alive to be hurt by his words. This archived article discusses the book's creation, Twain's status as a global superstar, and the clever marketing ploy of the century-long embargo, ensuring his voice would once again captivate the world long after he was gone.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris predicts an exciting British Grand Prix, suggesting a six-car battle for victory is possible at Silverstone. Qualifying was exceptionally close, with the top six drivers from Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari separated by less than a quarter of a second. The teams have opted for different car setups, particularly regarding downforce levels, which creates varied strengths on the straights versus the corners. This strategic diversity, combined with the potential for rain, sets the stage for a highly unpredictable and competitive race among the top teams.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 29 people in Parliament Square for demonstrating in support of Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. Under the new designation, expressing support for the group is a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was enacted following an incident where activists caused an estimated £7 million in damage to military aircraft. Protesters held signs stating "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action," leading to their arrests under the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

          <p>India is poised for victory in the second Test against England, largely thanks to a masterful century from captain Shubman Gill. Following his first-innings 269, Gill scored another 161, allowing India to set England an improbable target of 608 runs to win. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the close of day four, with star batsman Joe Root sensationally bowled by Akash Deep. With India's bowlers finding significant movement, England faces the difficult task of surviving the final day to salvage a draw and maintain their series lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, not a matter of hygiene, according to health experts. As skin ages, the breakdown of certain fatty acids produces a compound called 2-nonenal, which has a distinct musty or greasy scent and is not easily washed away. This article explains that factors like medications and hormonal changes can also contribute to changes in body odor. While a sudden, significant change in scent could indicate an underlying health issue, experts suggest that a holistic approach including an antioxidant-rich diet and skincare can help manage age-related odors.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that struck on July 4th, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise to near-historic levels in minutes. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly admitted the county lacks a river warning system and that officials had "no reason to believe" the event would be so catastrophic, despite a flood watch being in effect. The floodwaters surged during the night while many residents were asleep, contributing to the high death toll. This lack of specific, urgent warning is now a key focus in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>

While she faced criticism in her neighborhood for being exclusionary, many online commenters sided with her, expressing concern over the appropriateness of expecting another parent to provide such intimate care and questioning the parenting of the boy's own family.</p>

When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he simply meant a moneylender who charges high rates.

Burns emphasizes that the U.S. is held together by the words of its founding documents, and that citizenship requires an active, ongoing engagement with this complex history to navigate contemporary divisions and sustain the republic.</p>

          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT highlights a key nuance in the U.S. tax system: the primary disparity between the wealthy and the middle class lies not in tax rates, but in how income is taxed. While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, similar to some middle-class brackets, their wealth grows primarily through investments, which are not taxed until they are sold. The AI explained the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where billionaires live off tax-free loans against their assets, allowing their wealth to grow largely untaxed, a privilege unavailable to those earning regular wages.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, the Reform UK Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has given up the party whip while he is investigated over his business dealings. The Sunday Times published allegations questioning the eligibility of two of his companies for £70,000 in government-backed Bounce Back loans during the COVID-19 pandemic. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but stated he requested the whip be suspended as a "precautionary measure." Reform UK will conduct its own internal investigation, and McMurdock will now sit in the Commons as an independent.</p>

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump against political opponents, including Elon Musk and prospective New York mayor Zohran Mamdani, have escalated concerns about the state of U.S. democracy. This article analyzes the pattern of threatening deportation, arrest, or loss of citizenship against those who criticize or defy him. While some see it as a distraction tactic, democracy advocates warn that the threats themselves constitute an attack on freedom. They argue that by creating a climate of fear, the administration is chilling free speech and weaponizing the state against its critics, regardless of whether the threats are ultimately carried out.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently shared on a podcast that her decision to be a single mother was a conscious and deliberate choice. She explained that growing up in a family with alcoholism and a tumultuous parental relationship made her wary of repeating those cycles. Theron also recognized her own pattern of "losing herself" in relationships and attracting narcissistic partners, concluding she was not capable of being in a healthy relationship while raising children. Relationship experts quoted in the article support her decision, framing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and alignment with her personal values.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men from Asia and Latin America to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden nation with which they have no ties. The men, who had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were the subject of a prolonged legal battle that saw them held temporarily at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. After the Supreme Court cleared the way, the deportations proceeded despite warnings from human rights advocates that the men could face torture or other harm. The move marks an unprecedented step in the administration's immigration policy, establishing a willingness to deport non-citizens to third-party countries.</p>

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems has led to "tipflation," where customers are increasingly prompted to tip in situations where it was not previously expected, such as at fast-food counters or self-service kiosks. This article explores the psychology behind tipping and how technology is changing social norms, often presenting pre-calculated options of 15-25% that pressure consumers. While tipping is seen as a way to reward good service or supplement low wages, the constant requests are causing confusion and irritation for many. Experts note this trend benefits not only employees but also the tech companies that process the transactions.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in downtown Indianapolis early on July 5th left two people dead and five others injured, just hours after the city's Fourth of July fireworks display. One of the deceased was a juvenile, and police noted that hundreds of unsupervised youths were present in the area. A visibly upset police chief criticized parents for not supervising their children, stating that officers had already made arrests and confiscated weapons from minors before the shooting occurred. Police have detained seven individuals for questioning and recovered multiple firearms from the scene.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran may strengthen North Korea's conviction that a nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival, according to some foreign policy analysts. The action could be perceived by Pyongyang as evidence that the U.S. is an unpredictable and untrustworthy force, reinforcing the belief that only nuclear weapons can guarantee the regime's security. This development could further diminish any remaining possibility of denuclearization. The analysis suggests North Korea might now prioritize making its arsenal more mobile and resilient to ensure its second-strike capability against a potential attack.</p>

This sets up a highly competitive group stage where every match will be critical. While England and France are favorites to advance, major tournament debutants Wales have shown they can compete with top teams and will look to cause an upset, particularly in their highly anticipated final group match against the Lionesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "cortisol cocktail" trending on TikTok, which combines ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and magnesium, is being promoted as a way to lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts say there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Doctors note that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are rarely a target for reduction outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most people and can aid in hydration, its stress-reducing effects are probably due to a placebo effect or the minor relaxation benefits of magnesium.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the MingKwai, an innovative Chinese typewriter designed in the 1940s by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered after being thought lost to history. The machine was a groundbreaking attempt to solve the challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. Its unique system, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is a conceptual ancestor to modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery is significant for scholars studying the history of technology and the politics of language in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>Continuing his feud with the Trump administration over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new political party. He suggested the "America Party" could gain significant influence by focusing its resources on winning just a few key House and Senate seats. Given the narrow margins in Congress, this strategy could allow the new party to act as the decisive swing vote on major legislation. Musk posted a poll on his social media platform X asking followers if he should proceed with the idea, which came after he spent $277 million helping to elect Trump in 2024.</p>

The project, which took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic delays, is part of Kim Jong Un's push to boost the economy through tourism. However, the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors, with the exception of small, curated groups from Russia, with whom Pyongyang has strengthened ties. The resort's opening highlights the regime's dual pursuit of economic development and military ambition while it remains isolated.</p>
