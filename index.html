          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust reduced visibility to near zero, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office issued such a warning. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the storm, leading to hazardous conditions on major interstates and ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers. Several schools closed due to power outages from earlier severe weather, and cooler, drier conditions are expected over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its broader restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier in the week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The move reflects Nissan's efforts to streamline operations and address financial challenges in a rapidly changing automotive market. More details are expected to follow as the company finalizes its restructuring plans.</p>

          <p>Angels Flight Railway, a historic funicular in downtown Los Angeles, will increase its fares from $1.00 to $1.50 starting June 1, marking the first price increase since 2017.

This adjustment aims to ensure the railway's continued operation and preservation as a historic landmark, with officials not anticipating another price increase in the near future.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's initial insistence that Joe Biden was fit to run for re-election, despite concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. She suggests that many Democrats were in denial, influenced by groupthink, risk aversion, and the increasing prevalence of gerontocracy in American politics. Goldberg argues that while Biden's inner circle may have shielded him, the signs of his decline were evident to many, and the party's failure to address these concerns honestly has been a disservice to voters. She calls for a reckoning within the party to learn from these mistakes and regain credibility.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded message on social media, consisting of seashells arranged to spell the numbers "8647." Trump supporters claimed the numbers represented a threat, with "86" meaning to get rid of and "47" referring to Trump as the 47th president. Comey removed the post, stating he did not realize the numbers could be associated with violence, and the Secret Service launched an investigation.

The agency pointed to the failure of successive administrations and Congresses to address the growing debt, which now exceeds $36 trillion. Moody's specifically mentioned the potential renewal of the 2017 tax cuts, which could add trillions to the national debt. While the U.S. financial system remains stable, the downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs and further economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with over 150 years of history, has started offering a five-day seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques. The seminar, part of a course organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to promote sake appreciation beyond Japan. The initiative reflects a shift in the industry, as domestic sake consumption declines, and the brewery hopes to expand its exports to Europe by sharing its expertise internationally.</p>

          <p>An audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s 2023 interview with special counsel Robert K. Hur was released, revealing instances where Biden struggled to recall key dates.

This release comes as the Trump administration plans to release the full interview recording, reigniting scrutiny over Biden's cognitive abilities. The emergence of the recording coincides with renewed concerns about Bidenâ€™s health and the efforts to downplay these concerns during his presidency.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, was stolen, with only the statue's feet remaining. Police are investigating the theft, with local residents speculating about vandalism or the statue being melted down for cash. The statue, which replaced a wooden version that was set on fire in 2020, had never gained much affection from the locals. The statue's disappearance coincides with broader global expressions of dissatisfaction with Trump's policies through acts of vandalism and satire.</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party faces low approval ratings, some top Democrats are shifting from being staunch Biden supporters to acknowledging their past concerns about his fitness for office. Some former Biden surrogates now admit that it was "obvious" that Mr. Biden "was not in a condition to run for re-election." This shift reflects a broader effort within the party to rebuild trust by confronting how they handled the 2024 race, with some officials complaining that White House aides kept Mr. Biden cloistered as his condition worsened. This issue could emerge as a dividing line in the 2028 presidential primary.</p>
