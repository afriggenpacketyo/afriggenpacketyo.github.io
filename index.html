Authorities report that the incident occurred while four people were playing video games in a dorm room, leading to the arrest of an 18-year-old suspect. New Mexico State Police are investigating the motive, and the university has confirmed that campus will be open with counseling services available for the community.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Tunisia's capital, calling for the downfall of President Kais Saied's government, which they label an "authoritarian regime." The demonstrations mark four years since Saied dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree, a move critics call a coup. Protesters, rallying under the banner "The Republic is a large prison," demanded the release of jailed opposition figures, journalists, and activists. Since 2021, Saied has consolidated power by dissolving judicial bodies and imprisoning numerous opponents, leading to widespread fear and accusations that democracy in the country has been dismantled.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave the space agency through the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. This initiative, aimed at reducing the size and cost of the federal government, would shrink NASA's civil servant personnel from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The potential exodus comes amid a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and recent leadership instability, including a withdrawn nomination for the agency's administrator. NASA maintains that safety remains a top priority as it navigates these changes.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that one of two hand grenades recovered from a Santa Monica townhome is missing following a blast that killed three Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) confirmed that one grenade detonated on July 18 at a training academy, but the second device remains unaccounted for despite an extensive search. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that an investigation is underway to determine the origin of the military-grade explosives and locate the missing device. Officials are also conducting an independent review of the department's procedures for handling explosive materials.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has suggested the United Kingdom will take part in airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza after Israel agreed to allow such deliveries from foreign countries. The move comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in the territory and increasing political pressure on Starmer's government to recognize a Palestinian state. While aid agencies caution that airdrops are an inefficient method of delivery, the UK government stated it would "pull every lever" to get food and medical support to Palestinians. The UK has previously participated in aid airdrops to the region in 2024.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without shortstop Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production, scoring five or more runs for the seventh time in their last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who delivered a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who had multiple hits and a sacrifice fly. The performance provided a much-needed boost for the team's lineup ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially shift the balance of power, giving President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) control of the parliament. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups after the KMT, in coalition with the Taiwan People's Party, passed controversial reforms expanding parliamentary powers and obstructed the president's agenda, including defense spending. The election is taking place amid accusations of interference from China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions led to a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive after a poor season last year. However, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying up wetland habitats. While this year has been a bumper one for some species, the long-term trend for the UK's flying insect population remains one of decline.</p>

          <h2>Former Prosecutors Describe DOJ's Interview with Ghislaine Maxwell as Unorthodox</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have expressed bewilderment over the Justice Department's decision to have Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche personally interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. They described the meetings as highly unorthodox and concerning, breaking with the standard practice of having line prosecutors who are familiar with the case conduct such interviews. Experts raised questions about Maxwell's credibility, as she is likely desperate to reduce her 20-year sentence, and the political motivations behind the high-profile meeting. The move is seen by some as an effort to address political pressure rather than a standard investigative procedure.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential mid-air collision, injuring two flight attendants. Passengers reported being lifted from their seats during the maneuver, which the airline stated was in response to two onboard traffic alerts. The pilot reportedly informed passengers that he had to take evasive action to avoid another aircraft, identified as a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which is the second near-miss involving a commercial airliner in the U.S. this week.</p>

          <p>An article explores the validity and flexibility of widely accepted health guidelines, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. While some experts emphasize the critical importance of certain targets, like achieving at least seven hours of quality sleep to reduce long-term health risks, others suggest more flexibility. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, drinking when thirsty is a sufficient hydration strategy. The consensus among experts suggests that while these benchmarks are useful guides, individuals should focus on consistency and adapting healthy habits to their own lifestyles rather than rigidly fixating on numbers.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, focusing on the unique physiological needs of female athletes, who were once treated as "mini-men." Researchers are studying how factors like breast biomechanics, the menstrual cycle, and a higher susceptibility to certain injuries, such as ACL tears, affect performance. This research is leading to practical applications, from custom-fitted sports bras that can improve running efficiency to teams tracking menstrual cycles to optimize training and reduce anxiety. The goal is to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and provide tailored support that improves both performance and long-term health for women in sports.</p>

Experts who reviewed the contents, which consist mainly of dried goods like pasta and lentils, noted serious deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. While the boxes may provide enough calories for short-term survival, prolonged reliance on this diet could lead to diseases like anemia and scurvy. The aid also requires clean water and fuel for preparation, both of which are critically scarce in the besieged territory.</p>

Experts suggest that watching unfiltered interactions can help viewers understand different perspectives, overcome biases, and spark important national conversations on topics like coercive control and racism. Despite valid concerns about contestant welfare, these shows can serve as a tool for greater social understanding and self-reflection.</p>

Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, demand for matcha has soared, with some cafes reporting that a month's supply now lasts only a few days. The surge in demand is colliding with smaller tea crops in Japan, caused by record-breaking heatwaves and an aging farmer population. This has led retailers to limit purchases and has pushed prices up by around 30% this year, with further increases expected due to new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods.</p>

          <p>An expert from Refugees International warns that Gaza is on the brink of a mass starvation crisis that will be difficult to reverse once it begins. After 21 months of war and inadequate nutrition, the population is extremely vulnerable, and the current blockade imposed by Israel has reduced aid to a trickle. The primary aid provider, the GHF, is described as ineffective, with its distribution model forcing hungry Gazans to risk their lives crossing insecure territory. The expert argues that Israel is explicitly using starvation as a weapon of war and that a full-scale famine will lead to widespread death from both hunger and disease.</p>
