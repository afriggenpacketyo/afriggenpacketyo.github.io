With the Trump administration's restrictions on international student enrollment, some applicants may turn to other schools, potentially reducing competition for those who remain steadfast in their goal of attending Harvard. Despite the ongoing strife, Harvard's brand remains strong, and the school is likely to maintain its appeal to top students worldwide.
