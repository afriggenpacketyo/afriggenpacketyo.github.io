          <p>Mexican authorities found 20 bodies in CuliacÃ¡n, a city experiencing a violent turf war between factions of the Sinaloa cartel. The discoveries included decapitated corpses and bodies left in a van with a cartel-related message, highlighting the escalating violence that residents say is beyond government control. The U.S. has recently sanctioned one of the involved groups, Los Chapitos, as a terrorist organization for its role in fentanyl trafficking.

          <p>A U.S. government vaccine advisory committee, the ACIP, has voted to recommend against the use of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, in flu vaccines. This decision, which still requires CDC approval, affects a small percentage of the U.S. flu shot supply but aligns with long-standing goals of anti-vaccine activists, including HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health experts express concern that the move could reinforce unfounded fears about vaccine safety, despite numerous studies showing no link between thimerosal and developmental disorders, and potentially lead to fewer vaccinations and more illness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has again raised the controversial proposal of deporting U.S. citizens who commit serious crimes, a concept many legal experts argue is unconstitutional. Speaking at a migrant detention center, Trump stated he believes such individuals, including those born in the country, should be removed and that his administration is exploring the legality of such an action. This follows a memo from the Justice Department granting U.S. attorneys wider discretion in pursuing denaturalization. Legal scholars warn this violates the Eighth Amendment, though it could potentially be applied to naturalized citizens who committed fraud during their application process.</p>

Three Republicansâ€”Thom Tillis, Rand Paul, and Susan Collinsâ€”voted against it, citing concerns over the deficit and cuts to social programs.

          <p>Dating app Tinder is rolling out a mandatory facial recognition feature, "Face Check," for all of its users in California. The function requires users to take a short video selfie, which is then used to verify that their face matches their profile photos and to detect duplicate or impersonator accounts. This move is part of a broader effort by parent company Match Group to enhance user trust and combat the rising prevalence of romance scams and fraudulent accounts. The initiative comes as Congress also takes action with the Romance Scam Prevention Act.</p>

          <p>An opinion column explores the escalating feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, culminating in Trump's suggestion that Musk, a naturalized citizen, could be deported. The author argues this highlights a dangerous trend of weaponizing the denaturalization process against political enemies, a threat also leveled at progressive NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. While Musk's falling out with Trump may seem like political theater, the precedent of threatening citizenship to silence dissent is described as a chilling abuse of executive power. It creates an environment where the nation's 25 million naturalized citizens could be intimidated into silence.</p>

          <p>Over 170 non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders, are calling for the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to be disbanded. The GHF uses private firms for aid distribution, a system critics say is unsafe and has led to hundreds of deaths near distribution sites. The groups are urging a return to the UN-coordinated aid system. The call comes as the conflict continues, with an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza cafe reportedly killing 24 people, an incident the Israeli army says is under review.</p>
