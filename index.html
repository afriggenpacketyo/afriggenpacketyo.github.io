          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 19:49:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Energy Department has canceled over 300 green energy projects across 16 states, rescinding nearly $8 billion in funding. This decision, announced during a federal government shutdown, significantly impacts efforts to reduce carbon emissions, combat pollution, and strengthen electrical grids, potentially leading to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. Critics, including state officials and environmental advocates, strongly condemn the cuts as politically motivated, arguing they will inflate energy costs and destabilize the business community. The Trump administration, however, defends the action, asserting that a thorough financial review deemed these projects economically unviable and lacking a positive return on taxpayer investment. Energy Secretary Wright claimed many awards were rushed in the Biden administration's final months with inadequate documentation, aiming to protect taxpayer dollars and expand affordable energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Idaho judge has prohibited the release of graphic images from the home where Bryan Kohberger murdered four college students, deeming them "incredibly disturbing" and an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." While law enforcement can release other investigatory records, any containing blood or victims' bodies must be blacked out to protect the families' sensitivities. This ruling follows requests from victims' families and comes after Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary, avoiding the death penalty in a deal. The decision aims to balance public interest in the high-profile case with the severe emotional impact on those involved, ensuring a degree of closure and respect for the victims.</p>

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth surged after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in close communication with the White House regarding potential deals. This development follows recent Trump administration investments in other critical mineral companies like Lithium Americas and MP Materials, aiming to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earths. Humpton expressed strong support for these strategic investments, emphasizing the collaborative effort needed from multiple players to build out the domestic rare earth supply chain. The article highlights the administration's strategic focus on boosting American manufacturing competitiveness and securing essential resources, signaling a positive outlook for the industry and national security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress that the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, designating them as terrorist organizations. This declaration follows three U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the southern Caribbean Sea last month, which resulted in 17 fatalities. The administration justifies these actions by stating that cartel-smuggled drugs constitute an "armed attack" against U.S. citizens, granting it wartime powers to kill and detain members. Critics, including former State Department attorneys and some lawmakers, strongly question the legal basis for this expanded use of military force without explicit congressional authorization, raising significant concerns about its legality and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing substantial gains, with holdings now valued at US$21 billion, as gold prices continue a world-beating rally. Analysts from Swiss banks and JPMorgan Private Bank predict further increases, with gold potentially reaching US$3,900-US$4,150 an ounce in the next year. This surge is attributed to gold's role as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against economic and geopolitical risks, alongside robust central bank demand and a weakening dollar. The article indicates a strong, positive market trend for gold investors, with 13 gold ETFs on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges returning 42% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is urging nine prominent U.S. universities to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which outlines specific requirements for preferred access to federal funding. This agreement demands a five-year tuition freeze, a ban on using sex and gender in admissions, and caps on international student enrollment, among other conservative priorities. Schools that sign would receive priority for federal grants and partnerships, while those that decline risk losing benefits. Critics view this as an attempt to reshape higher education and impose ideological control over institutions, raising concerns about academic freedom and institutional autonomy. The universities are asked to provide feedback by October 20.</p>
