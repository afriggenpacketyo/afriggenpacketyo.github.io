        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its recent fiscal second quarter, achieving its highest comparable sales growth in three years. Despite this positive performance, CEO Corie Barry maintained a cautious full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumer spending and overall business operations. The company is actively addressing market challenges, including reduced demand for large appliances due to higher interest rates, by launching a new third-party marketplace to expand its offerings. Strong gaming sales, particularly from the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, were a key driver, though other categories like home theater saw weaker performance, prompting strategic adjustments for the latter half of the year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department announced that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter of 2025, an upward revision from the initial estimate of 3%. This stronger growth follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which was mainly caused by a surge in imports preceding new U.S. tariffs. The second-quarter rebound was significantly driven by a sharp decline in imports, contributing over 5 percentage points, alongside improved business investment in areas like AI and increased consumer spending. Despite these positive indicators, economists caution that the substantial import-related boost might temporarily inflate the perceived underlying economic strength.</p>

Sophia, who was in her first week of seventh grade, remains in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery, facing a long and uncertain path to recovery. This deeply personal account highlights the broader devastation of the incident, which claimed the lives of two children and injured 17 others.

Freeman, described as heavily armed and possessing extensive bush survival skills, fled into rugged forested terrain near Porepunkah, Victoria, prompting a cautious and widespread search operation. This tragic incident highlights the rare occurrence of police fatalities in Australia and draws attention to the nation's stringent gun laws, implemented following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. Authorities are warning the public not to travel into the surrounding alpine area while the suspect remains at large, emphasizing the danger he poses.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking to prevent her removal from office in what would be an unprecedented action in the Board's history. Trump announced her termination, citing unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud related to private properties, which Cook's attorney argues do not meet the "cause" requirement stipulated by the Federal Reserve Act for a Governor's removal. This significant legal battle, which is expected to potentially reach the Supreme Court, emerges after months of Trump's public criticism of Cook and other Fed members for not lowering interest rates. Cook has not been charged with any crime and has publicly vowed to continue fulfilling her official duties.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock turned positive on Thursday, rebounding after an initial post-earnings dip, as investors responded favorably to the chipmaker's better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. The company reported a substantial 56% surge in sales, reaching $46.74 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, both surpassing analyst estimates. Although data center revenue slightly missed projections for the second consecutive period, CEO Jensen Huang underscored the immense and nascent stage of the AI revolution, forecasting trillions in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Market analysts view these results as consistent with Nvidia's objectives and not indicative of any slowdown in industry-wide AI interest or investments.</p>

This unfortunate incident, which did not involve any other cyclists, is expected to sideline the Israel-Premier Tech rider for the remainder of the season.

          <p>Donald Trump has issued an executive order targeting cashless bail policies, asserting they endanger public safety and will lead to federal resources being withheld from jurisdictions implementing them. He ordered the Attorney General to identify states and localities that have eliminated cash bail for various crimes. Critics, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Brennan Center for Justice, argue that Trump's claims are based on myths and lack evidence, with studies showing no link between bail reform and increased crime rates. The article highlights that cash bail disproportionately affects racial minorities and the economically disadvantaged, benefiting the profitable bail bond industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005 due to mergers. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was lauded as the soundest globally during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from its large, economically strong players. However, former FDIC chair Sheila Bair cautions against market domination, warning it can stifle competition, innovation, and lead to less competitive pricing. Concerns are rising as the Federal Reserve recently proposed lowering capital requirements for big U.S. banks, potentially accelerating further consolidation.</p>

          <p>Madeleine Beekman's new book, "The Origin of Language," posits a novel theory placing child-rearing at the center of human language evolution. Challenging traditional male-dominated evolutionary narratives, Beekman argues that the intense need for assistance in caring for vulnerable early human infants drove the development of complex vocal communication. Biological changes, such as elongated vocal cords and larger brains, set the stage, but the demands of raising helpless offspring spurred the creation of words, syntax, and grammar for cooperation. This perspective suggests language emerged as a survival mechanism, fostering shared understanding and collective care, and has implications for understanding modern isolated parenting.</p>

          <h2>Film Review: 'The Roses' Offers a Brutally Funny Take on Divorce</h2>

          <p>Jay Roach's "The Roses" is a remake of the 1989 film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as Theo and Ivy Rose, a couple whose marriage dissolves into a hilariously brutal battle over their California mansion. The script by Tony McNamara delivers sharp, cruel humor, with Colman and Cumberbatch excelling in their roles, particularly Cumberbatch in a rare comedic turn. The article notes that while the original satirized materialistic baby boomers, this version delves deeper into the characters' attempts to make their marriage work, making their eventual dissolution more poignant. Despite a hasty ending and some silly gags, the film is praised for its insight into modern success-driven lives and its potential to revive adult comedies.</p>

          <h2>CDC Director Susan Monarez's Lawyers Argue Only President Trump Can Fire Her</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers for CDC Director Susan Monarez assert she remains in her post, arguing that as a presidential appointee, only President Donald Trump has the authority to fire her, not White House staff. This legal challenge follows a White House announcement of her termination, which Monarez's attorney claims is "legally deficient." The dispute highlights a deep rift over vaccine policy between Monarez and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Kennedy, in a Fox News interview, stated the CDC "needs to be fixed" to execute Trump's "ambitious hopes" for the agency, suggesting further leadership changes.</p>

          <p>The economics of American college sports are undergoing a monumental shift as the $19 billion industry prepares to pay its athletes for the first time. For decades, college athletes, despite generating massive revenues for universities—such as the University of Michigan's football program, which earned $150 million last year—received no direct salaries. This long-standing amateur model is finally changing, upending traditional practices and potentially reshaping the entire landscape of collegiate athletics. The move marks a significant departure from previous norms, acknowledging the immense value and contributions of student-athletes to a highly profitable enterprise and addressing long-standing debates about fair compensation.</p>

          <p>An analysis indicates a marked decrease in international visitor numbers to the United States in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This observed decline coincides with the Trump administration's actions, including significant cuts to government departments, strained international alliances, increased deportations, and the deployment of the National Guard onto city streets. The article suggests that such political developments and the resulting global perceptions may be contributing to a downturn in tourism, challenging the notion that all publicity is beneficial.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that understanding China's "needs" rather than its "wants" is crucial for managing the US-China rivalry and preventing further escalation. The article highlights that China's national security white paper prioritizes people's security, political security, and economic security, reflecting internal constraints and the Communist Party's legitimacy. Actions perceived as unbounded ambition, such as diversifying energy sources or indigenous innovation, are framed as risk management for regime survival. Recognizing these vulnerabilities, particularly in economic growth and energy reliance, could offer policy leverage and prevent the bilateral relationship from becoming more dangerous.</p>

Critics, including a member of Congress, express concern over entrusting such a large facility, expected to house 5,000 migrants, to an inexperienced firm, raising fears about standards and potential for abuse.
