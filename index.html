          <p>A dump truck driver in Eden, North Carolina, allegedly failed to stop at a stop sign and struck a crew of utility workers, resulting in the deaths of four men and injuries to three others. The incident occurred as the workers were addressing power lines, and the truck also collided with an occupied bucket truck before ending up in a ditch. The dump truck driver, Michael Ray Vernon, has been charged with a stop sign violation and misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, with authorities stating that impairment is not suspected. The victims were contractors for Duke Energy and Carolina Power and Signalization, and the collision remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Michigan on April 29, marking his first visit to the state since winning it in the 2024 election. He will deliver a speech at Macomb Community College to commemorate his administration reaching the 100-day milestone. The visit comes after Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer met with the president twice at the White House to discuss jobs, tariffs, the economy, and manufacturing.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers for Venezuelan men facing deportation argued before the Supreme Court that the Trump administration is violating due process rights by failing to provide adequate notice. The legal challenge centers on the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations if proper notice is given. Plaintiff attorneys contend that notices were inadequate, provided only in English, and lacked information on contesting removal. Legal experts anticipate the cases will continue through the court system, with the Supreme Court likely to provide further clarification on due process requirements. </p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters are concerned about President Trump's aggressive expansion of executive power and have doubts about key aspects of his agenda. Majorities of voters view the early months of Trump's administration as "chaotic" and "scary," even among those who approve of his job performance. Voters also express a lack of confidence in Trump's handling of critical issues like the economy and immigration, which were previously considered strengths. Trump's approval rating stands at 42%, historically low for a president at this point in their term.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and charged with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. The charges stem from an incident where Dugan allegedly misdirected immigration agents away from a Mexican national facing misdemeanor battery charges. After learning of the agents' presence, Dugan reportedly argued with them before ushering the defendant and his lawyer to a side door, though he was apprehended shortly after. Reaction to the arrest has been divided along partisan lines, with Democrats criticizing the move and Republicans emphasizing the importance of cooperating with law enforcement.</p>

A recent study in India indicated that creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants, showing improved outcomes in participants receiving creatine alongside talk therapy. While preliminary, these findings suggest creatine's potential as a cheaper and more accessible treatment option.</p>

          <p>Cuts to the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) could lead to increased HIV drug resistance in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is endemic. UNAIDS warns that this could necessitate more expensive and difficult-to-access second- or third-line therapies, making it harder to end the AIDS epidemic. New and more dangerous strains of HIV resistant to existing drugs could develop, potentially spreading globally, including to the United States. Experts argue that cuts to overseas aid are a false economy, given the potential for a resurgence of the virus.</p>

Wallace admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were "probably true" but insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims "absolutely not true".</p>

Lifting the sanctions could facilitate trade discussions and improve overall relations between China and the EU, but it is unlikely to revive a frozen trade and investment deal.

          <p>With American birth rates near record lows, the Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children. However, economists are skeptical, noting that other countries with similar demographic trends have seen limited success with such incentives. Some experts suggest tackling long-standing economic issues, such as affordable day care and paid parental leave, could provide a more supportive environment for families. The cost of raising a child in the U.S. is estimated at around $300,000 to age 18, making a one-time bonus insufficient for many parents.</p>
