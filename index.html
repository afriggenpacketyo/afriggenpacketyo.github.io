          <p>North Korea is planning to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia's Kursk region, according to a top Russian official, signaling increased cooperation between the two nations. This move follows previous reports of North Korea supplying combat troops and weapons to support Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu stated that Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers for mine clearance and 5,000 military construction workers for infrastructure restoration. South Korea, the U.S., and Japan have expressed grave concerns over the deepening ties between North Korea and Russia, fearing that Russia may provide Kim with advanced technologies for his nuclear and missile programs.</p>

          <p>Air India Flight 171 crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, prompting a detailed investigation to determine the cause. Investigators will examine the wreckage, flight data, and cockpit voice recorders to understand what went wrong in the seconds after takeoff. Possible causes being considered include engine failure due to bird strikes or fuel contamination, improperly extended flaps, maintenance errors, or inadvertent crew actions. The investigation will involve analyzing physical evidence, aircraft performance data, and recordings from the "black boxes" to build a coherent picture of the events leading to the crash. The Boeing 787's flight management control system will be scrutinized to determine if a systemic issue affected the global fleet, and the probe will include pilot licenses, training records, and simulator performance.</p>

          <p>Japan recorded a 637.61 billion yen trade deficit in May, primarily due to plunging auto-related shipments to the United States, potentially influenced by higher tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. This marks the second consecutive month of a trade deficit, as overall exports fell by 1.7 percent year-on-year, the first drop in eight months. The decline was largely driven by an 11.1 percent fall in shipments to the United States. The data reflects ongoing trade uncertainties and the impact of U.S. trade policies on Japan's economy.

The defense now plans to present their case in two to five days, a significant reduction from their initial request of up to two weeks. Legal experts suggest this change may indicate that the defense has identified weaknesses in the prosecution's case. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault, with potential penalties ranging from 15 years to life in prison if convicted.

          <p>China has successfully completed the inaugural test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, designed for lunar missions by 2030. The test involved a critical zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The Mengzhou spacecraft features two variants: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space missions. During the test, the spacecraft's escape engines ignited, the return capsule separated cleanly, and parachutes deployed for a safe landing, simulating emergency crew extraction during a launch failure. This marks Chinaâ€™s first test of this kind since 1998.</p>

          <p>Officials are warning about the rise of cosmetic procedures like fillers and Botox being performed in unsafe locations such as public toilets and hotel rooms. The lack of regulation in the aesthetic industry is putting people's lives at risk, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI). Unsafe fillers and fat-dissolving injections are being sold online, exacerbating the problem. Trading standards officials are particularly concerned about young people getting injections without proper age verification. Consumers are advised to check qualifications, be wary of social media advertising, and avoid buying products for home injection.</p>

          <p>Australia is set to lift its ban on blood and plasma donations for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Under the changes, most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. The rules will begin being revoked from next month, following similar moves in the UK and US.</p>

          <p>With Donald Trump's administration casting doubt on collective defense commitments, European allies need to take control of NATO to protect their interests, according to an analyst. This involves building a "European pillar of NATO," where European governments maximize NATO's chain of command and experience in collective defense. This would prepare them for a scenario where they may need to act without the United States. While maintaining transatlantic ties is crucial, Europe must be ready to lead in security matters, especially as the U.S. shifts its focus towards countering China.</p>
