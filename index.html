          <p>A vote on the "Big Beautiful Bill Act," a Republican mega-bill intended to progress President Trump's agenda, failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from hard-liners concerned about the national debt. The bill's failure is a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson, who has been working to unify the factions within his conference. Trump had urged Republicans to unite behind the bill, which included provisions on SALT caps. Johnson said he kept Trump updated on the bill's progress, with the president expressing excitement about the House's "forward progress."</p>

          <p>Former President Trump claimed that former FBI Director James Comey was advocating for his assassination in a deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647," which Trump and his allies interpreted as a call to "86" the 47th president. Trump asserted that Comey knew exactly what the numbers meant and that it was a clear call for assassination. Comey denied the allegations, stating that he posted a picture of seashells forming the numbers as a political message but removed it after realizing some associated the numbers with violence. The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service opened an investigation into Comey's post.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 50.8 in May, nearing a record low, as Americans grow increasingly worried about tariffs leading to higher inflation.

Tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, highlighting the significant impact of trade policy uncertainty on consumer thinking.

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain college majors, including nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. The study, based on 2023 Census data, found that computer science and computer engineering graduates had higher unemployment rates compared to those with degrees in humanities and healthcare-related fields. This shift reflects a growing demand for creative thinking and soft skills, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, and the continuing need for healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles fires, victims from Altadena and Pacific Palisades have scattered across the country, disrupting tight-knit communities. Many residents have relocated to rentals, facing increased expenses, school transfers, and the loss of established relationships. Data analysis reveals that over half of those who moved ended up at least a half-hour's drive away, while a quarter left the Los Angeles metro area entirely. The diaspora underscores the far-reaching impacts of climate disasters on community cohesion and individual lives.</p>

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can provide a predictable income stream during retirement, but the monthly payments vary based on factors like age, gender, and contract structure. An analysis of Cannex data suggests that a 65-year-old man might receive around $322 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive about $309. While these payments may not cover all expenses, they can supplement Social Security and other retirement funds, offering peace of mind and protection against longevity risk. However, it's important to consider the limited access to funds and potential tax implications before investing. (not investment advice)</p>

The central dispute revolved around the power of federal court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, preventing the government from enforcing a policy on anyone in the United States. The administration's lawyer, D.

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence declined in May, reaching its lowest level in three years, due to rising inflation fears and concerns about President Trump's trade policies. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 50.8, indicating increasing caution among Americans about the economy. The decline is attributed to worries about tariffs and their potential impact on prices, although recent pauses on import levies may lead to an improvement in sentiment. The survey results suggest that consumer spending may be increasingly restrained under the current economic agenda.</p>

Springsteen, a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates, made his remarks at a concert in England, accusing Trump of authoritarianism and rolling back civil rights. Trump's response included disparaging comments about Springsteen's skin and urging him to "keep his mouth shut" until returning to the U.S. This is not the first time Springsteen has criticized Trump, having previously endorsed Kamala Harris and called Trump the "most dangerous candidate" in his lifetime.</p>
