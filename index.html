          <p>President Trump signed executive orders to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerate nuclear reactor deployment, focusing on small, advanced reactors while supporting larger plants. The orders mandate NRC decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months and aim to reorganize the agency, potentially leading to staff reductions. Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez emphasized that regulatory delays have been a major issue, and the new framework also allows the Departments of Energy and Defense to build reactors on federal land for defense and AI data centers. Additionally, the orders seek to boost uranium mining and reactor testing at national laboratories, reflecting growing investment in nuclear power after a period of industry financial struggles.</p>

The panel of judges delivered the verdict in a Paris courtroom, finding eight of the ten defendants guilty and acquitting two others. Kardashian testified during the trial, recounting the harrowing experience and expressing her fear for her life. The suspects, dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their age, were accused of stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewelry, including a diamond engagement ring from Kanye West.

          <p>New Jersey is preparing for its gubernatorial elections, with primaries next month potentially signaling the national mood for the 2026 midterms. The Democratic primary features a crowded field including U.S. Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, and NJEA President Sean Spiller. Republicans are aiming to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on Trump over the years.

While the agreement shields Boeing from being labeled a felon and avoids a trial, families of the victims have criticized the deal as lenient and called for greater accountability from the company and its executives.</p>

In most cases, restarting the medication resolved the issue, and the FDA plans to update prescribing information to include a warning about the itching risk.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk's advisor, has launched a "survey of surveys" aimed at cutting some U.S. government data collection. This initiative raises concerns about potential duplication of efforts by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and possible violations of laws requiring the reporting of statistics from canceled surveys. DOGE claims to have already "terminated" five surveys, but critics argue the effort is heavy-handed and threatens federal employees, while most of the requested information is already publicly available.

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling blocked the opening of a religious charter school in Oklahoma, but a House-passed bill could create a federal school voucher program, potentially benefiting religious education. The legislation sets aside $5 billion for vouchers, allowing families to use the money for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning. This could bring vouchers to liberal states and reach up to 1 million students, with much of the money going to religious education. The program is structured as a tax credit, offering a large tax break for donations to nonprofits that provide private-education scholarships.</p>

The bill also includes a tax break for overtime pay, but both provisions have restrictions and expire after 2028. Some critics argue that the tax breaks primarily benefit higher-paid workers, while low-income workers may not see any benefit, and the bill includes cuts to social safety net programs.

It updates California's rules to align with federal laws against human trafficking and seeks to prevent taxpayer money from funding abusive supply chains.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reignited trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in America. The EU has been described as “very difficult to deal with” by Trump, who also claims the bloc was formed “for the primary purpose of taking advantage” of the U.S. on trade. Shares in the U.S. and EU fell after the latest threats, with Apple shares dropping nearly 3%. The EU is one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners, sending more than $600 billion in goods to the U.S. last year.</p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a surge after President Trump signed executive orders aimed at supporting the nuclear industry. Advanced reactor companies like Oklo and NuScale saw significant increases, with Constellation Energy and Cameco Corp. also rising. The orders focus on small advanced reactors and aim to streamline the regulatory process, allowing the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land. These actions also seek to boost uranium mining and domestic enrichment capacity, reflecting renewed investment in nuclear power.</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed frustration with Apple producing iPhones in Asia, threatening a 25% tariff if the company does not manufacture them in the United States. This public spat highlights the challenges businesses face in navigating Trump's trade policies. Apple has been shifting production to countries like India and Vietnam, but Trump insists on domestic manufacturing. Analysts believe shifting production to the U.S. would take years and significantly increase iPhone prices, while Apple is also facing competition in the AI market.</p>
