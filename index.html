        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential deal between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership could involve a licensing agreement for the app's highly valuable algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block the sale of the technology, which is considered the key to TikTok's success. While an agreement appears to be moving forward, significant national security concerns remain regarding how U.S. user data would be protected and whether China-based engineers could still access or influence the platform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program used by U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The White House stated the move is intended to ensure companies are hiring "truly extraordinary people" and not replacing American workers with cheaper labor. However, critics and policy experts warn this drastic fee increase could incentivize U.S. companies to move jobs overseas and deter international students from studying in the country.

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel has concluded its meetings, voting on several key vaccine recommendations. The committee supported using separate MMR and varicella shots for young children instead of the combined MMRV vaccine, citing a slightly higher risk of fever-related seizures with the combined dose. For COVID-19, the panel shifted from a broad recommendation for most adults to advising "individual-based decision-making," a notable change in official public health guidance.</p>

          <p>In a sharply divided vote, a key CDC advisory committee decided against recommending that a prescription be required for COVID-19 vaccines, opting instead for guidance based on "individual-based decision making." The meeting was marked by tense debate and confusion, reflecting the new composition of the panel appointed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision comes amid a changing landscape for vaccine availability and has raised concerns among medical experts about potentially undermining public confidence in vaccinations.</p>

The move is seen as a significant strategic measure in the region and could prompt China to enhance its own counterstrike capabilities in response.</p>

          <p>A journalist for the local news website L.A. Taco has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, alleging that officers repeatedly violated his First Amendment rights. The journalist, Lexis-Olivier Ray, claims that while he was documenting sweeps of homeless encampments, he was wrongfully threatened with arrest and, in one instance, was placed in handcuffs by officers. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges scrutinizing the LAPD's treatment of the media during police operations.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that the man who pleaded guilty to the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 also intended to kill two other justices. According to a sentencing memorandum, Nicholas Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" following the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The Justice Department is seeking a sentence of at least 30 years to life in prison, describing his premeditated actions as an "abhorrent form of terrorism."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, a deal that would value the company at an enormous $200 billion. However, Musk has since publicly denied the report on his social media platform, X, calling it "fake news." If the fundraising were to be confirmed, it would represent another massive valuation in the highly competitive AI sector, with the capital likely being used to fund the immense computing infrastructure needed for AI development.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that while the ABC network has the legal right to suspend its host Jimmy Kimmel, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, violated the First Amendment by threatening the network with regulatory consequences. Citing Supreme Court precedents like Bantam Books v. Sullivan, the article argues that government officials cannot use coercion or threats to pressure private parties into suppressing disfavored viewpoints. Carr's actions are framed as part of a broader pattern by the administration to intimidate the media.</p>

          <p>The White House has released President Trump's revised welcome letter for newly naturalized U.S. citizens, which notably shifts its focus from America's founding ideals to its national culture and traditions. Unlike letters from past presidents, which often described the U.S. as an "idea" or an "experiment" in liberty, Trump's letter stresses assimilation and forging a "sacred bond with our Nation, her traditions, her history, her culture, and her values." This change reflects a broader rhetorical shift toward a more nationalist definition of American identity.</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's suspension has brought renewed attention to the federal government's significant power over broadcast television licenses. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses the public airwaves to companies like Disney and NBC, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." President Trump and FCC Chair Brendan Carr have suggested that these licenses could be revoked for perceived political bias, a move that communications law experts describe as an unprecedented and politically motivated threat to press freedom.</p>

          <p>On the Hawaiian island of Molokai, a community-led nonprofit called the Molokai Heritage Trust is organizing an ambitious effort to buy back over 55,000 acres of ancestral land known as Molokai Ranch. The land is currently owned by a Hong Kong-based investment firm and has sat largely neglected for over a decade, causing significant environmental and infrastructure problems for local residents. If successful, the $260 million purchase would be one of the largest land-back initiatives in Hawaii's history, aimed at restoring the land to health and returning it to local stewardship.</p>
