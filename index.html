          <p>India and the U.S. are reportedly close to finalizing a trade deal that could see Washington significantly reduce tariffs on Indian exports to 15-16% from 50%. In return, New Delhi is considering scaling back its purchases of Russian oil, a move President Trump has pushed for. The agreement also involves potentially increasing India's import quota for U.S. non-GMO corn.

          <p>The World Health Organization's director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has described the health situation in Gaza as a "catastrophe" with generational consequences, citing famine, widespread injuries, and a collapsed healthcare system exacerbated by destroyed infrastructure. Despite a recent ceasefire, aid levels remain insufficient, with only 200-300 lorries entering daily against a target of 600. Dr. Tedros urged Israel to "de-link" aid from the conflict and remove restrictions on essential supplies, stressing that peace is the ultimate solution.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are anticipated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, at the request of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, to assist the city's understaffed police department. Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick confirmed the deployment, emphasizing a partnership rather than a takeover, with troops expected to support major events through Mardi Gras. While crime rates are down, the police department still needs approximately 300 more officers. Kirkpatrick stated that Guard troops should not be a permanent fixture, but a temporary force multiplier for specific law enforcement functions.</p>

San Diego Police confirmed the assault, which resulted in multiple bruises and a head laceration. No arrests have been made, and authorities are seeking information on the suspects.</p>

          <p>Gold and silver prices experienced their largest daily drops in years, with spot gold falling over 6% and silver more than 8%, bringing a halt to their recent rally. This downturn is attributed to easing U.S.-China trade tensions, a stronger U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions. Despite the pullback, analysts remain bullish on precious metals for the coming year, citing elevated inflation, low real interest rates, geopolitical concerns, and U.S. government dysfunction as supportive factors.

          <p>Los Angeles communities are experiencing widespread darkness due to surging copper wire thefts, prompting a new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, to take effect next year. The law targets recyclers by requiring identity verification and lawful ownership proof from sellers, making certain scrap metal illegal to possess, and increasing penalties for purchasing stolen public materials. The Sixth Street Bridge, left dark by $11,000 in stolen wire, faces $2.5 million in repair costs, exemplifying the extensive financial and safety impacts of these crimes.</p>

While the design resembles Apple's, Samsung and Google position the Galaxy XR as a stepping stone to future AI glasses. However, Gemini's cloud-based processing raises privacy concerns, and the market for such niche devices remains small compared to smartphones.</p>

Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi confirmed no missiles reached Japanese waters.
