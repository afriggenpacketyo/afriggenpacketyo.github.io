          <p>Apple's second fiscal-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street forecasts, although its Services division revenue fell slightly short of estimates. The company reported EPS of $1.65 on revenue of $95.4 billion, exceeding expectations, with iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales performing strongly. Apple's CEO Tim Cook noted that a large portion of iPhones sold in the US are sourced from India, while most other products are sourced from Vietnam, where tariffs are lower than from China. The board authorized up to $100 billion in share repurchases and increased the dividend by 4%.</p>

          <p>On Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, two children and one adult were hit by a car outside a church preschool, possibly in an intentional act. One child and one adult were hospitalized, while the third victim was treated at the scene. The suspect fled on foot and is believed to be armed with a knife, prompting an active manhunt involving local police, the FBI, and U.S. Marshals. Authorities are conducting grid searches and using drones, and they advise residents to report any sightings of a white male wearing a red shirt and shorts to 911.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require placebo testing for all new vaccines and develop vaccines without mRNA technology, extending his influence into vaccine development. This move raises questions about the availability of COVID boosters in the fall, as Kennedy has expressed skepticism towards mRNA technology. Experts are concerned that these changes could erode trust in the vaccine approval process, potentially leaving the U.S. population vulnerable to COVID-19. The new policy could affect the next round of COVID booster shots, and raises ethical questions about depriving patients of effective vaccines.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that semaglutide, marketed as Wegovy and Ozempic, may benefit patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition. The study revealed significant improvements in liver health among patients receiving semaglutide treatment, with almost two-thirds experiencing a reduction in liver inflammation and over a third showing reduced liver scarring. Dr. Celine Gounder notes that while the results are promising, longer-term studies are needed to fully assess the medication's effects. MASH can cause liver scarring, cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.</p>

The proposal, which may become part of a state budget agreement, has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, Betty Rosa. The changes could include delaying consequences for private schools that flout state education law by not offering basic education in English or math, and lowering the standards that a school would have to meet to demonstrate compliance.</p>
