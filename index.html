          <p>A Ryanair flight from Berlin to Milan experienced violent turbulence over southern Germany, leading to an emergency landing at Memmingen Airport. Nine individuals, including eight passengers and one crew member, sustained injuries during the incident. Three of the injured were hospitalized for treatment, while the remaining six received outpatient care. Authorities grounded the plane, and the airline arranged for bus transportation to Milan for the passengers, who were traveling 380 kilometers south of Memmingen. Elsewhere in the region, storms caused damage to homes in Ulm, Baden-W칲rttemberg, with fire officials suspecting a tornado or waterspout in the Donaustetten district. The German Weather Service (DWD) has warned of further storms in the region, forecasting hail, strong winds, and localized heavy rain. The event highlights the risks associated with air travel during severe weather conditions. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the recovery of the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages, Judy Weinstein-Hagi and Gadi Hagi, from the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip. The couple, dual U.S.-Israeli citizens from kibbutz Nir Oz, were killed during Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack and their bodies were subsequently abducted. The Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency conducted the special operation to retrieve the remains. Netanyahu vowed to continue efforts to return all abductees, both living and deceased, to their homes, emphasizing the government's commitment to resolving the hostage situation. The IDF had previously determined they were killed on the day of Hamas' surprise attack by the same terror group, Kitab al-Mujahidin, that abducted and killed Israeli hostage Shiri Bibas and her two young children.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has suspended three lawmakers from Te P캐ti M캐ori for performing a haka in protest of a proposed law. Hana-R캐whiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban, while Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were barred for 21 days, marking the longest bans in the Parliament's history. The lawmakers performed the haka, a traditional M캐ori chanting dance of challenge, in November to oppose a bill they believed would reverse Indigenous rights. The suspensions were approved despite opposition proposals for lighter sanctions, sparking debate about the Parliament's respect for M캐ori culture. The severity of the punishments has raised questions about the balance between freedom of expression and parliamentary decorum.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, is on trial for allegedly murdering relatives by serving them a beef Wellington dish containing death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors suggest that photos found on her phone depict her using kitchen scales to measure a lethal dose of the toxic fungi. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming she never intended to harm her guests and that the incident was a tragic accident. The prosecution presented evidence suggesting Patterson had foraged for wild mushrooms, including death caps, despite initially denying it to the police. The trial has included testimonies from over 50 prosecution witnesses, with Patterson taking the stand to defend herself.</p>

          <p>The fragile trade truce between the United States and China is showing signs of unraveling, with both countries accusing each other of violating the terms of the agreement. President Donald Trump has claimed that China has "totally violated" the deal, while China asserts that Washington has imposed discriminatory measures since the Geneva talks. The dispute centers on issues such as US access to rare earths and China's compliance with commitments to increase purchases of American goods. Uncertainty looms over the prospects for a lasting ceasefire and a long-term trade deal as the 90-day pause approaches its expiration date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections about the potential impact on contraception. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in overweight or obese individuals, necessitating the use of condoms or alternative contraceptive methods. The MHRA acted after receiving reports relating to unintended pregnancies, emphasizing the need for clear communication about the risks and benefits of these medications.</p>

          <p>This article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting differing attitudes toward women's and transgender rights activism. Polls reveal that younger people are more likely to disagree with the legal definition of "woman" being based on biological sex. The author challenges the notion that older generations are simply reactionary, arguing that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist. She suggests that life experiences, such as childbirth and menopause, contribute to a greater awareness of biological sex and its implications. The author concludes that the Equality Act, with its protection of sex-based rights, remains vital.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein are experiencing a significant decline in U.S. demand following President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the de minimis loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users (DAUs) dropped by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%. Monthly active users (MAUs) also saw declines for both platforms, with Temu down 30% and Shein down 12%. The user drop off coincides with both companies reducing their U.S. advertising spending after the tariff announcements.</p>

President Donald Trump's policies could potentially serve as a catalyst to bring the three nations together.

This has led to accusations of bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement. The creation of National Defense Areas along the border allows the military to detain migrants as trespassers. While crossings have slowed, questions are being raised about the effectiveness and legality of Trump's border tactics, with critics arguing that the expanded military presence is unnecessary and infringes on civil liberties.</p>

However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive to be realistic.

The tariffs could lead to a surge of migrants, hurt consumers worldwide through higher prices, and deepen geopolitical fissures. Business interests have historically kept relationships between rivals on an even keel, but the shift away from free trade can make the world a poorer and more perilous place.
