        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs was acquitted of the most serious charges against him, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, following a lengthy trial. However, the jury found him guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which could result in a maximum sentence of 20 years. A federal judge denied his request for bail, citing his history of violence, meaning he will remain incarcerated until his sentencing hearing. His lawyer reported that Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon returning to jail and intends to re-enter a domestic batterers program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent future human errors after a significant controversy. The change comes after an operator accidentally deactivated the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking technology during a key fourth-round match, leading to a contentious point being replayed. The All England Lawn Tennis Club stated that operators can no longer manually disable the system, ensuring such an error cannot be repeated. The incident has also prompted discussions about potentially introducing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, for future championships.</p>

          <p>An individual who opened fire at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, has been reported dead. According to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Border Patrol agents and local police collaborated to neutralize the shooter at the entrance of the sector annex. The incident resulted in injuries to two officers and one Border Patrol employee, who were subsequently hospitalized for treatment. This event occurred on Monday morning at the southern Texas facility, which is located near the U.S.-Mexico border, and follows another recent shooting outside an immigration center in Alvarado.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported that the incident occurred just before 1 a.m., with victims ranging in age from 15 to 24. Officers had been monitoring the area over the weekend due to prior disturbances and were responding to a nearby call when they heard the gunfire. Authorities recovered dozens of shell casings, suggesting a possible exchange of fire, and have taken one person with a weapon into custody, though their involvement remains unclear amid the ongoing investigation.</p>

Bessent noted that foreign officials are rushing to negotiate before high tariff rates are scheduled to resume, though the collection of these tariffs has been pushed to August 1. This comes as President Trump indicated he could send up to 15 letters to trade partners dictating new tariff rates or announcing bilateral agreements. The administration's new timeline has raised questions, but officials maintain it is designed to accelerate negotiations with U.S. trading partners.</p>

Navarro described the situation as the "longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley," referencing ongoing pressure from the Trump administration for Apple to onshore its production. President Trump has recently intensified these demands, threatening tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones made outside the U.S. and specifically discouraging production in India. Despite expert opinions on the infeasibility of moving all production to the U.S., Navarro insists it is possible with modern manufacturing techniques.</p>

According to Russia's state-run news agency TASS, Starovoy fatally shot himself in his car, with suicide being the primary hypothesis. His dismissal followed a weekend of major air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after Starovoy's death was reported, another senior transport official, Andrei Korneichuk, also died suddenly during a meeting from a suspected cardiac arrest, adding to a series of sudden deaths among high-profile Russian figures.</p>

The report also notes national security concerns, as rising interest payments could squeeze defense spending.

The town's health crisis stems from a now-closed vermiculite mine that exposed residents to asbestos for decades.

The court ruled it was scientifically plausible that her partner, who was using a product with ostarine, could have transferred sufficient amounts through saliva over a nine-day period.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at an all-time high and interest rates soaring, many consumers are exploring debt management programs. These programs, offered by credit counseling agencies, negotiate with creditors to lower interest rates and waive fees, consolidating multiple payments into one. While they don't reduce the principal balance, they can make repayment more manageable, with participants often seeing their monthly payments reduced by 30-50%. The average credit card APR for those in such programs can drop significantly, potentially saving thousands in interest and shortening the repayment timeline by years, though modest monthly fees apply.</p>

Other alternatives discussed include debt consolidation loans, home equity lines, and financial hardship programs offered directly by lenders, which may provide relief without the same level of credit damage.</p>

The inquiry follows a public warning from OpenAI, which stated that Robinhood's "OpenAI tokens" are not actual equity and that the company did not partner with or endorse the offering. The product, launched in the EU, allows users to invest in tokenized shares of private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The Bank of Lithuania is now evaluating the legality and compliance of these instruments, emphasizing that investor information must be clear, fair, and not misleading.</p>

          <p>The tactic of federal immigration agents wearing masks and balaclavas during enforcement raids in Los Angeles is causing confusion and fear among residents. Critics, including a former ICE policy counselor, warn that the practice is dangerous, as it makes it difficult for the public to distinguish legitimate officers from criminals. In contrast, defenders cite security concerns, arguing that masks protect agents from doxing and threats in a politically charged environment. While there is no federal law prohibiting masking, the practice has led to incidents of impersonation and has escalated tensions between communities and law enforcement.</p>

The sale reduces the trust's position in Goldman Sachs, which has been a top performer in the S&P 500 Financials sector this year, gaining about 26%.

          <p>Apple is experiencing contrasting fortunes in its different ventures, with its blockbuster movie "F1" achieving major box office success while its artificial intelligence progress receives a lukewarm response. The success of "F1" highlights Apple's strength in long-term investment and cultural marketing. However, Wall Street remains underwhelmed by the company's AI advancements, particularly the delayed rollout of a more sophisticated Siri. While rivals like Google and Meta are aggressively advancing their AI assistants, Apple's slower, privacy-focused approach has raised concerns that it is falling behind in a critical technology race, despite its strong hardware ecosystem.</p>

Search and rescue operations are ongoing, complicated by debris and continued rainfall, while questions arise about the adequacy of official warnings.

The Houthis had reportedly been using the captured vessel as a floating observation platform, fitting it with a radar system. The ship's seizure had become a symbol of Houthi aggression in the Red Sea, part of their campaign to disrupt global trade in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

This move has made some investors nervous, as Musk's deeper dive into politics is seen as a distraction during a critical time for the company. Analysts note that while Musk has a core group of supporters, many investors are growing weary of his political activities, which previously included a controversial role with the Trump administration.
