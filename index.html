          <p>Amazon Web Services has resolved a major outage that disrupted thousands of online platforms worldwide, including social media, gaming, and financial services. The disruption, which lasted for most of Monday, was attributed to issues with its domain name system (DNS) in its eastern U.S. region. This incident highlighted modern society's significant dependence on a few major cloud computing providers for essential internet infrastructure, affecting everything from airline operations to smart home devices before services returned to normal operation.</p>

          <p>Former Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein has announced his candidacy for Kentucky's 4th Congressional District, launching a primary challenge against incumbent Republican Rep. Thomas Massie. Gallrein's campaign is heavily backed by former President Donald Trump, who has publicly criticized Massie as a 'Third Rate Congressman' and praised Gallrein as a 'Brave Combat Veteran.' The challenge highlights a significant intra-party conflict, with Massie being a frequent critic of Trump and now facing a well-funded opponent supported by the former president's political machine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive internet outage that affected numerous global companies was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error within Amazon Web Services (AWS), the internet's backbone for about a third of all online services. The issue, originating from AWS's largest data center in Virginia, effectively made it impossible for the system to direct user traffic to websites and apps. This event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with the heavy reliance on a small number of dominant cloud providers, like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, for critical internet infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following the resignation of Shigeru Ishiba. Her victory was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed a new coalition with the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. Takaichi, a protege of the late Shinzo Abe, is known for her ultraconservative and hawkish views, and her government is expected to pursue a stronger military and a revision of the pacifist constitution. Her leadership faces immediate challenges, including public anger over rising prices and the stability of her new, untested coalition.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the remains of Tal Haimi, an Israeli hostage killed during the October 7th attack, have been returned to Israel from Gaza. Haimi was defending his kibbutz when he was killed and his body was taken by Hamas. The return is part of a U.S.-brokered peace plan that required Hamas to hand over all deceased hostages, a deadline which had previously been missed. This development occurred after U.S. envoys met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to keep the fragile peace process on track amid recent violence.</p>

          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing an increasing willingness among international clients, particularly from Southeast and Central Asia, to settle trades using the Chinese yuan. One company representative noted that yuan-settled orders now constitute 10 to 20 percent of their total exports, a significant rise from last year. This trend is partly driven by the expansion of Chinese-led infrastructure projects abroad, such as data centers in Southeast Asia, which encourages the use of the yuan for transactions involving Chinese suppliers and products.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After four consecutive losses, Liverpool FC's recent struggles are raising critical questions for manager Arne Slot, despite nearly £450m spent on new talent. The team, which won the league last season, now appears defensively vulnerable and ineffective in attack, with key players like Mohamed Salah out of form. Pundits are questioning Slot's team selection and tactics, as expensive summer signings such as Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak have yet to make a significant impact, leaving the manager with a dilemma over his best starting lineup and strategy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian military sources report that hundreds of Russian soldiers are stranded on islands in the Dnipro river delta, facing starvation and constant attack in what is described as a 'death zone.' Recent footage shows Ukrainian drones targeting and destroying a boat of Russian soldiers attempting to escape the area. According to Ukrainian officials, the marshy, exposed terrain makes resupply and reinforcement extremely difficult for Russian forces, leading to significant casualties and dire conditions for those marooned on the river's treacherous front line.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are heavily focused on the ongoing scandal surrounding Prince Andrew, with new allegations emerging from Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir. Reports claim his team hired internet trolls to discredit her, while questions are also being raised about how he affords his residence at Royal Lodge on a 'peppercorn' rent. Furthermore, the Daily Telegraph reports that security services deemed him a 'potential national security risk' as early as 2021 due to his connections with an alleged Chinese spy, adding another layer to the crisis facing the disgraced prince.</p>

          <p>A new project called 'Reefline' is underway to create a seven-mile-long artificial reef and underwater art installation off the coast of Miami Beach. The structure, composed of marine-grade concrete sculptures designed by internationally known artists, will be populated with locally grown, resilient corals to restore marine habitat. The reef will be located in shallow water, making it accessible to swimmers and snorkelers, and aims to become a unique ecotourism attraction. The first phase, featuring concrete cars arranged in a 'traffic jam,' is set to begin this month.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to maintain a lower court's order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into the city. In their brief, they argue that the administration's request relies on 'mischaracterizations' of the situation and that state and local law enforcement are capable of handling protest activities. They contend that federalizing the Guard for deployment within Chicago would upset the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments over the militia.</p>

          <p>A theory known as 'winology,' which suggests that China's global achievements are unfairly dismissed by the West due to hierarchical thinking, is gaining popularity on Chinese social media and in academic circles. Coined by Chinese academics, the concept posits a perceived global hierarchy where Western nations are ranked higher, leading to a biased view of China's economic and technological progress. This idea is now the subject of academic seminars, with scholars arguing it helps foster important intellectual discussions about China's place in the world.</p>

          <p>Construction has commenced on a new ballroom at the White House, with demolition crews tearing down parts of the East Wing's covered entryway. President Donald Trump stated the project, which he says is privately funded by 'generous Patriots,' will fully modernize the wing. While the White House has released drawings of the planned structure, the project has raised concerns among some historians. They worry that the typical rigorous review process for such a significant historical building is being rushed and may reflect the president's personal style rather than the nation's history.</p>
