          <p>Scientists have identified a new skyscraper-sized asteroid, named 2025 SC79, which is the second-fastest known asteroid, orbiting the sun every 128 days. The discovery was made by Carnegie Science astronomer Scott S. Sheppard as part of a NASA-funded project to find "twilight" asteroids that could pose a potential threat to Earth. This celestial body is also only the second known object with an orbit entirely inside that of Venus, crossing Mercury's path during its journey.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, a decision President Trump attributed to an advertisement run by the province of Ontario. The ad featured edited clips of former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, which both Trump and The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation labeled as misleading. Ontario Premier Doug Ford defended the ad, stating it accurately reflected Reagan's support for free trade, though it omitted the context that Reagan was simultaneously defending his own tariffs on Japan. The move marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two allied nations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals How Ontario's Ad Edited Reagan's 1987 Speech on Tariffs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed comparison of an Ontario-sponsored advertisement to former President Ronald Reagan's original 1987 speech reveals how his words were edited. While the ad did not alter Reagan's anti-tariff quotes, it significantly reordered them and removed crucial context, such as his justification for imposing tariffs on Japan at the time. The original address shows that Reagan's comments against protectionism were part of a broader argument for free and fair trade, a nuance lost in the minute-long commercial. This selective editing is at the heart of the controversy that led to the collapse of U.S.-Canada trade talks.</p>

An IBM spokesperson confirmed the development, which is part of a collaboration aimed at building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. This milestone is seen as a significant step in scaling quantum technology without relying on expensive GPU clusters. The news also positively impacted other quantum-related stocks, highlighting growing investor interest in the advanced computing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the province will pause its controversial anti-tariff advertising campaign starting Monday, aiming to restart trade negotiations with the United States. The decision followed President Trump's declaration that he was terminating all trade talks due to the ad, which used former President Ronald Reagan's words to criticize tariffs. Ford stated the campaign had successfully initiated a conversation at the highest levels about the economic impact of tariffs. The ad will continue to air over the weekend, including during the World Series, before the pause takes effect.</p>

          <p>A significant U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean, including warships, advanced aircraft, and CIA authorization, is being analyzed as a campaign of intimidation aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While the official justification is a war on drug trafficking, experts suggest the scale of the operation points towards a strategy of signaling strength to encourage a military coup against Maduro. The U.S. has conducted strikes on alleged "narco-terrorist" vessels and increased its bounty for Maduro's capture, though these efforts have not yet yielded defections from his inner circle. This military posturing represents the largest U.S. deployment in the region for decades.</p>

The White House justifies these actions as part of a war on drugs, designating several cartels as terrorist organizations to authorize military force without congressional approval. However, the strikes have drawn criticism from lawmakers and foreign leaders like Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who question their legality and effectiveness.

          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis with a brain aneurysm, seemingly linking it to stress, medical experts have weighed in on the connection.

The primary culprits are typically genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but the news has raised public awareness about the condition, which is more prevalent in women.</p>

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case collapsed because a top national security official would not testify that China was considered an "enemy" of the state. The official, Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins, stated that such a label "did not reflect government policy" during the period of the alleged spying (2021-2023). This testimony was deemed crucial for prosecutors to prove that the defendants' actions were "prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State" under the Official Secrets Act, leading to the case's failure before it reached trial.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% that economists had anticipated. The report, released by the Department of Labor despite the ongoing government shutdown, is crucial for determining the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. While tariffs have contributed to upward price pressure, the impact on consumers has been partly muted as businesses absorb some costs. This inflation data is expected to support another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been given a whole-life sentence for the brutal murder and sexual assault of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in 2022, a case that has deeply shocked France. This is the country's harshest penalty, requiring a minimum of 30 years in prison, and Benkired is the first woman to receive it. The court noted the "extreme cruelty" of the crime, in which Lola was tortured and ultimately died of asphyxiation. The case has also been politicized by far-right figures, as Benkired was an Algerian immigrant under an order to leave the country.</p>

          <p>An Idaho hunter shot and killed a male grizzly bear near Island Park after the animal charged him from close range in dense vegetation. The hunter, who was not identified, immediately reported the incident to local authorities as required by law. Following a thorough investigation, Idaho Fish and Game officials concluded that the hunter acted in self-defense. While grizzly bears are protected under state and federal law, killing one is permissible if it is done to prevent serious harm or death. Officials noted that fall hunting seasons often lead to an increase in such encounters.</p>

Retailers are also emphasizing their lower-priced private brands to appeal to budget-conscious customers, while remaining "cautiously optimistic" about the overall season. (not investment advice)</p>

This is the tenth such strike in the administration's anti-cartel campaign, which has now resulted in at least 43 deaths and has expanded into the Pacific Ocean.
