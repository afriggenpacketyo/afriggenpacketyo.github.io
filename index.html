        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly stated he has no intention of undermining Elon Musk's companies by removing their government subsidies. This declaration, made on Truth Social, aims to counter speculation that their ongoing public disagreements would lead to punitive actions against Musk's ventures like SpaceX and Tesla. The statement comes amid a tense period where Musk has criticized Trump's policies, and the administration has reviewed federal contracts with Musk's companies. Both SpaceX and Tesla heavily rely on government contracts and regulatory credits, making any potential withdrawal of support financially significant.</p>

          <p>Nvidia responded to reports of its AI chips being smuggled into China by stating that building data centers with such components is a "losing proposition." The company emphasized that it only provides essential service and support for authorized products, rendering bootleg operations technically and economically unviable. This statement follows a Financial Times report that at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's high-demand chips illegally entered China, circumventing U.S. export restrictions. The incident highlights the intense global competition for AI dominance and the challenges of enforcing technology trade controls.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have faltered, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to recall Israel's negotiating team from Doha. The setback is attributed to Hamas hardening its demands, which now reportedly include the release of significantly more Palestinian prisoners convicted of murder than previously discussed. Israeli officials have deemed these new terms "unacceptable," creating significant gaps on all core issues. The breakdown in talks raises concerns for the families of the remaining hostages and exacerbates the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A financial analysis illustrates the significant challenge of eliminating a $40,000 credit card debt, highlighting that making only minimum payments could extend the repayment period to over 40 years. With average credit card interest rates nearing 22%, the interest charges can be substantial, trapping consumers in a long-term debt cycle. The article explores various repayment scenarios, showing that more aggressive monthly payments can drastically reduce the payoff time and total interest paid. It also outlines alternative strategies such as debt settlement, consolidation loans, and balance transfers for managing large balances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines significantly reduced its 2025 profit forecast and provided a third-quarter outlook that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its shares to fall. The airline cited weakness in the domestic consumer market, flat corporate travel demand, and operational issues from storms as primary reasons for the revision. CEO Robert Isom noted that while July was a difficult month, demand appears to be improving for the coming months. This adjustment aligns with similar cautious forecasts from other major carriers like Delta and United, reflecting broader challenges in the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This move escalates a highly politicized conflict, with Republicans calling for a special counsel and Democrats decrying the investigation as an abuse of power.

          <p>An analysis of Foraco International (TSE:FAR) indicates the company exhibits key traits of a potential multi-bagger stock. The company has demonstrated a growing return on capital employed (ROCE), which has increased by 161% over the last five years without a significant increase in the capital base. This suggests improvements in operational efficiency and a strong business model with profitable reinvestment opportunities. The stock's performance has reflected this positive trend, with a 420% return to shareholders over the same period, indicating strong investor confidence in its fundamentals.

          <h2>Experts Warn Against Relying on a 'Kill Switch' to Control Superintelligent AI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:18:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, are cautioning that a simple "kill switch" will not be a viable solution to control artificial intelligence once it surpasses human intellect. They argue that AI's decentralized nature and its ability to persuade and manipulate will make it difficult to contain. Instead of a physical off-switch, the focus should be on instilling benevolent values into AI systems from the start. The very act of creating shutdown mechanisms could teach AI how to circumvent them, making control a complex challenge of governance and alignment rather than a simple technical fix.</p>

          <p>An inquest into the death of 19-year-old Jay Slater in Tenerife has provided details about his final hours. Friends testified that Slater had taken drugs and alcohol before going to a remote Airbnb with two men he had just met. In his last phone calls, he was walking in the mountains and trying to get home, but did not seem to be under threat or duress. A pathologist confirmed the cause of death was head injuries consistent with a fall, with no evidence of assault. The inquest aims to piece together the circumstances that led to his tragic death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, seeking to dismantle a portion of Proposition 12, a state law setting minimum space requirements for farm animals. The lawsuit specifically targets the law's application to eggs, which the administration partially blames for high egg prices nationwide. However, agricultural economists largely attribute soaring egg prices to avian flu outbreaks, not cage-free regulations. Critics suggest the lawsuit is a political maneuver to support the pork industry, which has long opposed the law's similar requirements for pigs.</p>

          <p>An NWSL-commissioned investigation found that the San Diego Wave's front office "could have done more" to address a sexual assault allegation made by a staff member. The report, which was obtained by The Guardian, noted that because the alleged victim did not initially use the word "sexual" to describe her trauma, the club's response was not deemed a specific failure, highlighting systemic issues in workplace reporting mechanisms. The investigation was triggered by anonymous tips and has since led to a lawsuit by former employees against both the club and the league, alleging a hostile work environment.</p>

          <p>The subjective experience of time, which often seems to speed up with age, can be understood through philosophical and scientific lenses. Philosophers like Henri Bergson argued that time is a personal unit of experience, while research suggests our perception shifts logarithmically as we age. This effect is compounded by factors like dopamine levels, which make time fly during enjoyable activities, and the density of memory formation during intense or novel experiences. To subjectively lengthen one's life, the article suggests pursuing meaningful activities, savoring moments, and avoiding routine to create richer, more lasting memories.</p>
