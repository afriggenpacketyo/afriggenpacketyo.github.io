          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest 'Beige Book' report reveals a slight contraction in the U.S. economy over the past six weeks, citing concerns about tariff-related price increases and general economic uncertainty. Hiring has remained mostly stagnant across the Fed's districts, with many reporting flat employment and lower labor demand. The report also notes moderate price increases, with widespread expectations of faster cost and price growth due to higher tariff rates. This economic landscape reflects a cautious approach by both businesses and households in response to policy uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A researcher claims that the fungus Fusarium graminearum, recently labeled a "potential agroterrorism weapon" in an arrest, is already widespread in the U.S. and likely originated in North America. Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu were charged with attempting to smuggle strains of the fungus into the country for research purposes. The fungus causes Fusarium head blight or head scab, a common crop disease, and U.S. farmers rely on fungicides to mitigate its risk. Billions of dollars were lost in the 1990s due to epidemics caused by this fungus, which produces toxins monitored by the FDA.</p>

          <p>Former Miami Marlins team president David Samson has criticized the Kansas City Royals for calling up their top prospect, Jac Caglianone, citing concerns about service time and arbitration eligibility. Samson argues that the Royals should have waited to call up Caglianone to avoid him reaching arbitration a year earlier, which could cost the team millions of dollars. He believes that bringing Caglianone up now puts added pressure on him to perform immediately. Caglianone had a strong performance in the minors with a .322/.389/.593 slash line, but went 0-for-5 in his major league debut.</p>

The UK has been granted an exception, maintaining tariffs at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions.

          <p>Reddit has filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Anthropic, alleging that it illegally scraped user comments to train its chatbot Claude. Reddit claims Anthropic used automated bots to access its content despite being asked not to, and intentionally trained on the personal data of Reddit users without consent. Anthropic disputes the claims and intends to defend itself vigorously. Reddit has licensing agreements with other AI companies like Google and OpenAI, allowing them to train AI systems on its user data in exchange for payment and user protections.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has launched a diplomatic strategy to strengthen ties with Russia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Beijing aims to promote a shift to a multipolar world, defending the "rules-based, UN-centred" international system. China presents itself as a defender of multilateralism in contrast to Washington's "America first" policy. However, divergent world views and competing national interests could hinder Beijing's vision, as countries balance their relationships with both the U.S. and China.</p>
