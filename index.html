          <p>Germany's women's national team started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a significant knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of serious knee injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting doubt on her continued participation in the tournament. The team's performance improved throughout the match, but the potential loss of their leader is a major concern.</p>

          <h2>India's Role in SCO and Brics Highlights Geopolitical Tensions with China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's position within Global South alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics presents a challenge to China's leadership ambitions. The consensus-based decision-making rules of these groups give India significant influence, often leading to stalemates that highlight underlying rivalries. For instance, a recent meeting of SCO defense chiefs failed to produce a joint statement due to disagreements over language concerning terrorism, a contentious issue between New Delhi and Beijing. This dynamic underscores the ongoing geopolitical competition and India's capacity to act as a check on Chinese dominance within these organizations.</p>

          <p>A UK High Court judge has refused to grant a temporary injunction against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, with the ban taking effect at midnight. The direct-action group, known for protests against companies supplying arms to Israel, challenged the ban as an "authoritarian abuse" of power. However, the judge ruled that the public interest in maintaining the order outweighed the potential harm to the group. As a result, supporting or being a member of Palestine Action is now a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>According to a joint finding by Dutch and German intelligence services, Russia is systematically increasing its use of prohibited chemical weapons, such as the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin, in Ukraine. The report states that Russian forces use chemical agents to force Ukrainian soldiers out of their trenches, where they are then targeted with conventional weapons. This practice is described as having become "standardized and commonplace," violating the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is a signatory. Dutch officials have condemned the actions, calling for more sanctions and highlighting the danger this normalization poses.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state so far this year. The fire, which is only 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Officials noted the fire's "exponential growth" was fueled by weather, terrain, and dry conditions. State and federal agencies are operating in a unified command, deploying extensive air and ground resources to combat the fire and protect communities threatened by its spread.</p>

          <p>President Trump used the term "shylocks" to describe some lenders during a speech in Iowa, prompting criticism from groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for using a "centuries-old antisemitic trope." The word originates from the greedy Jewish moneylender character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned by reporters, Trump stated he was unaware of the term's antisemitic meaning, claiming he only understood it to mean a moneylender who charges high interest rates. The ADL called the president's use of the term "very troubling and irresponsible."</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie has progressed to the fourth round of Wimbledon, becoming the last remaining British player in the men's singles draw after a straight-sets victory over Matteo Bellucci. Norrie won 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 on Court One, navigating a tough first set before taking control of the match. He credited his win partly to drawing energy from the crowd, a tactic he noted was often used by Andy Murray. Norrie will next face Chile's Nicolas Jarry as he continues his campaign at the All England Club, having reached the last 16 for the second time.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen" rather than a "subject." He argued that this shift "turned the world upside down" and inspired subsequent revolutions globally. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, emphasized the importance of embracing the complexities of American history, including the flaws of its founders. He believes understanding these stories makes them richer, allowing the Declaration of Independence to resonate even with marginalized groups.</p>

When officers located the brothers, they allegedly resisted arrest, leading to a brawl in which the officers were assaulted, with one suffering a broken nose. The brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, have pleaded not guilty, claiming they acted in self-defense.</p>

However, critics note the tax break is temporary, set to expire in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-income workers who often have no federal tax liability to begin with.
