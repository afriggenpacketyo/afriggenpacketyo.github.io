          <p>Over 200 million Americans are under heat alerts as a severe heatwave grips the eastern half of the country. Forecasters predict "feels-like" temperatures could reach 105 to 115 degrees in the Southeast, with some areas in Mississippi and Louisiana potentially hitting 120 degrees. The prolonged and potentially life-threatening conditions are exacerbated by high humidity, offering little relief even at night. This event has already seen Tampa, Florida, break a 130-year heat record, highlighting the intensity of the weather pattern.</p>

          <p>A tragic boating accident off Miami Beach resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to four other individuals. The victims were part of a summer sailing camp when their sailboat collided with a barge and sank, throwing all six occupants into the water. Rescuers, including divers, responded quickly, but the two children were later pronounced dead at a hospital. The U.S. Coast Guard is now leading an investigation into the cause of the fatal collision.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles south-southeast of Hawaii and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the islands. Forecasters anticipate Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week as it moves westward. This development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several named storms.</p>

          <p>Real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie are starring in the new body horror film "Together," which explores themes of codependency and troubled relationships. In an interview, they discussed how being married in reality aided their portrayal of a long-term couple who become physically and supernaturally intertwined. Franco noted the challenging 21-day shoot required intense intimacy, which their real connection facilitated. The film, which blends horror with dark comedy, is being praised for its unique and surprisingly romantic take on the genre.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying the country's airlines about their future fleet requirements, specifically asking about potential orders for Boeing jets. This move is being interpreted as a positive signal that could improve trade relations between Beijing and Washington. Boeing, which has often been caught in the middle of bilateral tensions, could be a major beneficiary if a broader trade thaw occurs. The survey follows a meeting between a senior Boeing executive and the head of China's Civil Aviation Administration to discuss expanding cooperation.</p>

According to Capital Economics, this will raise the average tariff on EU imports from 1.2% to 17.5%, potentially reducing the EU's annual GDP.

The article posits this is a dishonest distraction tactic, built on the false premise that Russia did not intervene to help Trump, a conclusion contradicted by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

          <p>A 42-year-old man has been charged with terrorism and assault with intent to murder after a knife attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, that injured 11 people. The suspect, Bradford James Gille, allegedly used a folding knife to attack shoppers and an employee before being confronted by armed citizens in the parking lot. The prosecutor explained that the terrorism charge was filed because the act was intended to instill fear in the entire community. All victims are expected to survive, and authorities are still investigating the motive for the rampage.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has internally raised concerns that fintech middlemen like Plaid are "massively taxing" its computer systems with an excessive number of data requests. An internal memo revealed that of 1.89 billion data pulls in June, only 13% were directly initiated by customers for transactions. The bank claims the majority of these "pings" are for other purposes, straining its infrastructure and increasing fraud risks. As a result, JPMorgan is preparing to charge new fees for this data access, potentially disrupting the business model of many popular financial apps.</p>

          <p>The article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirement planning that suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually will likely make it last for 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to evaluate if an annuity's guaranteed income stream offers a better value than a traditional withdrawal strategy. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks inflation adjustments and liquidity. The article suggests a hybrid approach can balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

While Niccol quickly resolved Chipotle's food-safety crisis, Starbucks faces a host of different issues, including operational bottlenecks from mobile orders, labor unrest, and intense competition in China. These complex, medium-sized problems require costly and time-consuming solutions, and the company's stock performance has lagged since Niccol took over.

The analysis also forecasts that China will pivot its trade toward other nations, with Russia, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia emerging as major beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>
