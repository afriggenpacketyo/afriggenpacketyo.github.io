          <p>A driver intentionally plowed a car into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring at least 30 people. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after an individual was removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which he was shot by another individual who then fled the scene. The driver is in custody and will face charges of assault with a deadly weapon, while police continue to investigate the motive and search for the shooter.</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire declared by Syria's interim president, deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins persist in the southern Suweida Province. The violence, which has reportedly killed over 900 people, prompted Israeli military intervention in support of the Druze, targeting Syrian government forces. Although a US-brokered deal was meant to halt the fighting and Israeli strikes, reports of gunfire and looting continued in Suweida city. The situation highlights the deep-seated tensions and the precarious security for minority groups in the region.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, holding a four-shot lead heading into the final day at Royal Portrush. His consistent and unflappable performance, marked by a third-round 67, has created an air of inevitability around his potential victory. Scheffler, who has a perfect record of converting 54-hole leads into wins, is pursuing his fourth major title. His closest competitor is Li Haotong, while other contenders like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy face a significant challenge to overcome his commanding advantage.</p>

          <p>Former professional wrestling star Marcus "Buff" Bagwell, 55, has had his right leg amputated above the knee.

Bagwell was a prominent figure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) during the 1990s, where he was a five-time tag-team champion.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled that the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK could supplement or even replace the US security guarantee.

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona, a transfer that has sparked discussion about his fit with the Spanish club. After falling out of favor at Old Trafford, Rashford could provide a solution for Barcelona, which has been seeking to strengthen its left-wing attack after other targets became unavailable. The loan structure of the deal is financially advantageous for Barcelona, which still faces economic constraints. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, the move is seen as a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for Barcelona to acquire a talented player in his prime years.</p>

Although the conspirators were executed and initially labeled as traitors, they are now honored as heroes in modern Germany.

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A for its handling of slow play at The Open Championship. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace during the third round, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. Stenson noted the inconsistency of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday, when earlier rounds had run an hour over time. DeChambeau argued for a more modern and fair system, suggesting that every player's shots should be timed individually to eliminate ambiguity and hold slower players accountable.</p>

          <p>According to witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza, Israeli forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians seeking food, killing 32 people near aid distribution hubs in the southern part of the territory. The incidents occurred near centers operated by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. While the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after people approached its troops, eyewitnesses described indiscriminate fire on the crowds. The deaths highlight the chaos and danger surrounding aid distribution in Gaza, where the population faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the brink of famine.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores Generation Life, a faith-based group of young activists promoting chastity until marriage. The group conducts "beach outreach" at the Jersey Shore, engaging their peers in conversations about love, relationships, and the negative impacts of social media. Instead of focusing on abstinence, they frame chastity as a countercultural movement about seeing a person's whole worth beyond the physical, arguing it fosters deeper intimacy and self-respect. Their message taps into Gen Z's anxieties about modern dating and the pressures of online life, presenting caution and commitment as a form of empowerment.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house election, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing nationalist rhetoric, blaming foreigners for social problems and crime, and opposing reliance on foreign labor despite Japan's severe worker shortages. This stance is fueled by public frustration over issues like unruly tourists and media reports on crimes committed by foreigners. The trend reflects a broader global pattern of right-wing movements using immigration as a key political issue.</p>

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the 2024 building collapse in George, which killed 34 construction workers, was "entirely preventable." The investigation found multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and the ignoring of serious structural defects that were known for up to a year before the tragedy. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that red flags, such as workers feeling vibrations and a safety officer resigning in protest, were disregarded. He has called for criminal accountability for those found negligent in the disaster.</p>

Despite a $156,000 annual income, she stated they struggle to afford groceries because her husband spends hundreds of dollars monthly on tobacco and marijuana. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller, stating the problem was not a simple budget issue but one of addiction and control that needed to be addressed directly. He advised that if her husband is truly an addict, she must treat the situation with the seriousness it deserves rather than budgeting for his habits. (not investment advice)</p>

Doctors told him that a millisecond difference in the timing of the impact could have resulted in a season-ending surgery.
