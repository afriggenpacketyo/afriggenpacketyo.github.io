          <p>Three Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies were killed in an explosion at a law enforcement training facility in Monterey Park. The incident occurred at the Special Enforcement Bureau compound, which also houses the bomb squad, while the deputies were reportedly handling explosives. The cause of the blast is currently under investigation by multiple agencies, including the ATF and the FBI. Officials have expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy and are focused on supporting the families and determining the cause to prevent future incidents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected upon visa issuance. While a provision for reimbursement exists if visitors comply with visa terms, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear and expected to be complex. Travel industry groups and immigration lawyers have raised concerns about the implementation, with some advising clients to consider the fee nonrefundable.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island as part of the Trump administration's plan to convert the historic site back into a federal penitentiary. The directive aims to house the "most ruthless and violent offenders," with Bondi highlighting its escape-proof reputation. The proposal has drawn strong criticism from local officials and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who cite the significant loss of tourism revenue and call the idea unrealistic. The former prison, now a popular national park, generates about $60 million annually.</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for discovering King Richard III's remains, claims the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London actually survived. Her new book argues that the narrative of their murder was Tudor propaganda created to delegitimize Richard III. Langley's "Missing Princes Project" reportedly uncovered documents suggesting the elder prince, Edward V, lived on under a different identity. While the theory challenges a long-held historical belief, some experts remain skeptical, arguing it was too risky for Richard III to have left the legitimate heirs alive.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood is legally challenging a provision in a new federal law that would cut off Medicaid funding to its clinics nationwide. Attorneys argued in federal court that the move targets the organization and would harm vulnerable patients who rely on its services for contraception and other family planning needs. The statute, which went into effect in July, ends Medicaid payments to abortion providers that received over $800,000 from the program in 2023. A judge has temporarily blocked the cuts, with a decision on an injunction expected soon as some clinics have already closed.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumers' expectations for future inflation have dropped significantly, returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements, according to the latest University of Michigan survey. The one-year inflation forecast fell to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers remain wary, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary. The easing of inflation fears is an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve, though overall consumer sentiment remains below its long-term average. (not investment advice)</p>

Another major uncertainty is how Shohei Ohtani will be utilized as a pitcher and how his body will hold up to the two-way demands.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. While being on Social Security does not disqualify individuals from debt relief programs, eligibility often depends on demonstrating financial hardship and having some capacity to make payments. Strategies such as debt management plans, credit card hardship programs, and debt settlement can be viable options for seniors. It is important for retirees to choose an approach that aligns with their fixed income, and consulting a debt relief expert can help. (not investment advice)</p>

While the industry faces challenges like falling airfares for economy seats, both airlines have leveraged their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability.

However, the number of people housed in hotels at the end of March 2025 was higher than the previous June. Experts warn that the recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse these savings, and £270 million paid to Rwanda for the scrapped deportation scheme will not be refunded.
