          <p>The Philippines has raised alarms over China's new plan for the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, viewing it as a pretext for occupation rather than a genuine environmental effort. Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano labeled the move a clear step towards eventual control, prompting the foreign ministry to prepare a formal diplomatic protest. In response, China's foreign ministry asserted its sovereign right to protect the shoal's ecosystem. Beijing urged Manila to cease what it called provocative actions and sensationalism to prevent further escalation of maritime tensions between the two nations.</p>

The service uses artificial intelligence to rank and recommend 1.6 million destinations across mainland China, including restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. This move positions Amap as a key entry point for Alibaba's local lifestyle services, creating direct competition with Meituan's user review platform, Dianping.

          <p>The FBI and Utah authorities are conducting a manhunt for the individual responsible for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. New images of a person of interest have been released, and a reward of up to $100,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest. Investigators recovered a high-powered bolt action rifle believed to be the weapon used in what officials are calling a targeted attack. The incident has prompted widespread condemnation and discussions about political rhetoric from figures across the political spectrum, including President Trump.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to reconsider plans to raise tariffs on cars from Asia, particularly China, from 20% to 50%. The ministry stated that it hopes Mexico will be "extremely cautious" and threatened to take necessary countermeasures to safeguard its legitimate interests if the tariff hike proceeds. This development occurs as Chinese auto manufacturers have been increasing their investments and exports to Mexico, which serves as a key market and benefits from tariff-free trade with the U.S. and Canada under the USMCA agreement.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has intensified the debate around security and free speech on college campuses. The shooting, believed to have been carried out by a sniper from a rooftop, has prompted university police chiefs nationwide to re-evaluate their security protocols for large and controversial events. Experts highlight the difficult balance between ensuring safety and upholding free expression, with some fearing an "assassin's veto" could silence controversial speakers. While some campus police administrators anticipate a heightened diligence, they do not foresee an end to large outdoor events featuring politically contentious figures.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of leading a conspiracy to stage a military coup. The ruling found he attempted to remain in power after losing the 2022 election to his rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The court also barred the 70-year-old politician from running for public office until 2033. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the sentence, which has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial stabilizing force in a faltering multilateral global system. The author argues that as institutions like the United Nations are increasingly sidelined by unilateralism and trade conflicts, the SCO offers a necessary alternative for governance. It is presented as a platform where countries with diverse cultures and political systems can cooperate effectively. The organization is framed as an embodiment of principles that counter global fragmentation by promoting negotiation over sanctions and tariffs, thereby addressing key ailments of the current international order.</p>

Prosecutors presented their case, alleging a carefully crafted plot, and called several witnesses, including a Secret Service agent who discovered Routh armed on the property's perimeter. The agent testified that Routh aimed an SKS semiautomatic rifle at him before shots were fired and the suspect fled the scene.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in England are raising concerns that an increasing number of children are starting reception year without fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that a third have at least five children in their class needing help with toileting, and 92% have seen a decline in speech abilities over two years. Experts suggest social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors. This trend places additional burdens on schools, which are now often responsible for teaching basic developmental milestones alongside the standard curriculum.</p>

          <p>To help parents navigate the common challenge of fussy eating in children, a child nutritionist has shared several practical tips. The advice emphasizes reducing pressure at mealtimes by allowing children to choose whether they eat and not labeling foods as 'good' or 'bad'. Instead, parents are encouraged to make meals enjoyable, be mindful of fluctuating appetites, and involve children in food preparation to foster familiarity. The expert suggests that giving children autonomy and focusing on a balanced, neutral approach to food can help improve their relationship with eating and make mealtimes less stressful for the entire family.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court found the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their names, was discriminatory on the basis of gender and a "colonial import." The ruling gives the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect this change. The landmark case was brought by two couples who sued the Department of Home Affairs, challenging the law as a violation of the right to equality enshrined in the country's post-apartheid constitution.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators aiming to foster a stable, long-term bull market. Beijing's goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household wealth that can support consumer spending, shifting reliance away from the property sector. After a recent pullback moderated the market's rapid ascent, regulators may be focused on preventing the wild boom-and-bust cycles seen in past decades. Analysts suggest the market is transitioning to a slower, more sustainable uptrend, though volatility may increase as this new phase unfolds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southern Water has prohibited tanker companies from extracting its water after discovering it was being legally delivered to fill a new lake on the estate of American billionaire Stephen Schwarzman. The deliveries were sourced from an area in Hampshire under a drought order, sparking outrage from local residents who are subject to a hosepipe ban. While the water extraction was legal because it was for construction, not domestic use, the water company's managing director called the usage "appalling." A spokesperson for Schwarzman stated the water was sourced through licensed providers and that an advanced irrigation system would primarily fill the lake.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, security measures are being significantly increased for political figures across the United States. President Trump's speech at the Pentagon was moved to a more secure location, and several lawmakers have canceled or postponed public events out of an abundance of caution. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace announced she would resume carrying a firearm for her safety. The assassination has heightened anxieties about political violence nationwide, leading to lockdowns at several universities and an increased law enforcement presence at public gatherings involving high-profile individuals.</p>

This is the latest in a series of firings and resignations since President Trump became the center's chair and appointed Richard Grennell as its new president. Struthers was the administrative director for the center's jazz programming, an area that has seen significant changes, including the departure of its artistic director in July.

Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to restore standard practice and counter what Republicans describe as Democratic obstructionism. In contrast, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the move as an act of "genuflection to the executive branch" rather than a genuine effort to end obstruction.</p>

He criticized the practice of charging low base fares and adding fees for all other services. Kirby's comments reflect a broader challenge for ultra-low-cost carriers, which face intense competition from larger airlines that have successfully implemented their own basic economy fares.</p>

The worm, which can harm native plant growth and irritate skin on contact, has been migrating north along the East Coast. Authorities advise against squishing or cutting the worms, as this can cause them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they should be captured and either frozen for 48 hours or drowned in soapy water before disposal, and sightings should be reported to citizen science platforms to help track their spread.</p>
