          <p>An analysis suggests the Supreme Court is likely to reinstate President Donald Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military. The article argues that the Court has historically shown deference to the military's decisions, even when those decisions might violate constitutional principles in a civilian context. The author cites precedents like Goldman v. Weinberger (allowing a ban on yarmulkes) and Rostker v. Goldberg (upholding male-only draft registration) to support the claim that the Court is likely to side with the Trump administration, despite arguments that the ban is discriminatory.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's efforts to withhold funds from sanctuary cities. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by San Francisco and other cities challenging the executive orders targeting jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge cited the likelihood of irreparable harm to the cities, including budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust with their communities. This is a repeat victory for San Francisco, which successfully challenged similar policies during the first Trump administration.</p>

Republican lawmakers are calling for a criminal investigation into the matter, alleging that the governor's chief of staff orchestrated the scheme.

At the IRS, the departure of 22,000 employees due to DOGE is projected to result in an $8.5 billion revenue loss in 2026 alone.

Eubank Jr. emphasized that "pain" is not something Benn can inflict, given his personal experiences. The fight is taking place more than 30 years after their fathers began their own iconic rivalry. Eubank Sr. is unlikely to attend the bout due to a falling out with his son.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Venezuelan man deported to El Salvador, citing a violation of a previous court settlement. The 20-year-old, identified as "Cristian," was deported despite being covered by a settlement agreement related to asylum applications for unaccompanied minors. The judge referenced a similar case and ordered the government to request Cristian's release from El Salvador and his return to the U.S. for asylum adjudication.</p>

          <p>Employees at Barnard College received text messages from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) asking if they are Jewish or Israeli and if they have experienced harassment or antisemitism. The text messages, which linked to a voluntary survey, were sent as part of an EEOC review of employment practices at Barnard College. The survey has sparked anxiety among some recipients, who fear it could create a list of Jewish faculty and staff. Barnard College has stated that it is cooperating with the EEOC investigation.</p>

The assault was the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since last summer, prompting widespread condemnation. Mr. Zelensky said nearly 70 missiles, including ballistic ones, and about 150 attack drones had targeted cities across the country.</p>
