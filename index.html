          <p>A Maryland man with protected legal status was mistakenly deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison due to an ICE administrative error.  The error occurred despite the man having a U.S. citizen wife and child, and having been granted withholding of removal from El Salvador previously. The U.S. government acknowledges the error but claims it lacks jurisdiction to order his return, while his attorneys are pursuing legal action.</p>
