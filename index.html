          <p>A federal judge questioned whether a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, which seeks to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate meetings to the public, is merely a publicity stunt. During a hearing, Judge Beryl Howell noted the plaintiff's CEO had promoted the lawsuit on a television show, suggesting the legal action might be a business strategy to generate interest in the new fund. Azoria's lawyers denied this, arguing the suit is based on the federal "Sunshine Act," which they claim requires the Federal Open Market Committee's meetings to be public. The fund, led by a Donald Trump ally, has been critical of the Fed's high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The children, aged 7 and 9, were unharmed and are now in the care of family members.

          <h2>Legal Challenge Arises Over Alina Habba's Appointment as Acting New Jersey U.S. Attorney</h2>

          <p>President Trump's effort to keep his former lawyer, Alina Habba, as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor is facing a legal challenge from a defendant in a criminal case. The challenge argues that Habba's appointment as acting U.S. attorney is unlawful because it violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This move came after federal judges in the district had appointed her deputy to the role, a decision the administration circumvented by firing the deputy and reappointing Habba. The case questions the executive branch's authority and could impact prosecutions initiated under Habba's leadership in the state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team has requested an expedited deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, citing Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health concerns. The $10 billion lawsuit stems from a Journal article that claimed Trump wrote a "bawdy" letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his birthday in 2003, which Trump alleges is fake. Trump's lawyers argue that Murdoch's potential unavailability for a future trial makes his immediate testimony necessary. The judge has ordered Murdoch to respond to the request by early August as the legal battle over the controversial article continues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide, blocking a provision in a recent tax bill aimed at defunding the organization. The ruling, from U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, expands a previous injunction and protects access to services like birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings for low-income patients. Planned Parenthood had argued that losing Medicaid funding would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics, potentially affecting over a million patients. The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the reproductive health provider and the White House.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump used the platform to extensively praise and promote his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. In a lengthy response to a question, Trump detailed the costly renovations at his resort, describing it as "opulent and beautiful." The incident has intensified criticism that the president is mixing official duties with his private business interests, particularly as the Scottish government is already facing scrutiny for considering public funding for another of Trump's resorts. Ethics experts have previously warned that such actions could potentially violate the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause.</p>

The decision has caused concern among patients who have had success with Zepbound and fear potential side effects or reduced efficacy from switching.

          <p>A new report from five UN agencies indicates that over 2.3 billion people worldwide experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in the past year, with 673 million being undernourished. While global hunger levels have slowly declined since the pandemic's peak, the rising cost of food has made healthy diets unaffordable for a growing number of people. The report highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the most affected region where one in five people are undernourished. The data underscores that poverty, conflict, and climate events continue to be major obstacles to achieving food security and proper nutrition globally.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the distribution of child sexual abuse material, culminating in the conviction of at least 18 individuals. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Grayskull," targeted a network with over 120,000 members that hosted millions of illicit files. Among those convicted was a lead administrator described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. Officials called the operation one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Adam Coy, a former Columbus, Ohio police officer, has been sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for the 2020 murder of Andre Hill. Coy fatally shot the 47-year-old Black man, who was unarmed and holding a cellphone, in a friend's garage. The officer claimed he feared for his life, believing Hill had a revolver, but prosecutors argued Hill was compliant and posed no threat. The case drew national attention, particularly after body-camera footage showed a nearly 10-minute delay before officers rendered aid. Coy, who plans to appeal, was fired shortly after the incident.</p>

Leaders from Germany and France called the deal damaging and a form of submission, while others lamented that the EU failed to secure better terms. Despite averting a full-scale trade war, the consensus in Brussels is that the deal is lopsided and comes at a high price for the European economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The bank, which is the largest in the U.S., claims this activity is costly to maintain and is linked to higher fraud rates.

The vote was controversial because it was bundled with an extension of a dual-class share structure that grants enhanced voting power to its co-founder and CEO, Kristo Käärmann.

Her attorneys contend this agreement provided immunity to any potential co-conspirators, including Maxwell, and that this promise should be honored nationwide.
