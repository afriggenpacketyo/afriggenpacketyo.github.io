          <p>A violent incident at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, has resulted in at least one fatality and nine non-life-threatening injuries from gunshot wounds. According to the Grand Blanc Township Police Department, a 40-year-old male suspect intentionally drove his vehicle into the church building, began shooting, and then deliberately set the structure on fire. The alleged shooter was later killed by responding officers, and authorities have assured the public that the immediate threat has been neutralized. The FBI has deployed agents to assist in the investigation, with officials working to determine a motive for what has been described as a "cowardly and criminal act" at a place of worship.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially announced his decision to drop out of the city's mayoral race. The announcement came on Sunday, confirming earlier reports from the New York Post before Adams released a statement on social media. His withdrawal from the campaign follows polling data that indicated he was trailing behind both his Democratic and Republican challengers. This development significantly alters the landscape of the upcoming election for the leadership of the nation's largest city, opening the field for other contenders to gain prominence in the race.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting and arson at a Michigan church, investigators are actively exploring the motive behind the violent assault. An ABC News source briefed on the investigation revealed that detectives are urgently working to determine if the timing of the attack is connected to the recent death of Russell M. Nelson, the 101-year-old president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The incident, which involved a suspect setting a five-alarm fire that caused a partial building collapse, has prompted widespread condemnation and highlighted growing expert warnings about violence targeting religious institutions across the United States.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has issued a warning to the Labour party, stating it should not underestimate the "peril" it faces from the political threat of Reform UK. Speaking at a fringe event during the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Burnham continued his critique of Keir Starmer's leadership, advocating for an open debate about the party's future direction. He argued against a "climate of fear" that stifles discussion, emphasizing the urgent need for a clear plan to counter Reform, especially with Labour trailing in opinion polls ahead of local elections next year.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police have arrested several individuals at a protest held in support of Palestine Action outside the Labour party conference in Liverpool. The demonstrators were detained on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organization, as the government designated Palestine Action a terrorist group under the Terrorism Act in July. This proscription makes membership or expressed support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

          <p>Amid escalating tensions and clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin is demanding a meeting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. The senator has been pressing for congressional oversight of the facility for weeks due to reports of poor conditions, but access has been denied. The situation intensified after federal officers used pepper spray and rubber bullets on protesters during recent demonstrations, part of a controversial ICE operation in the Chicago area dubbed "Midway Blitz" by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Residents in rural American communities are worried about the future of the Head Start program, a federally funded initiative providing early childhood education, childcare, and family services. For many low-income parents, particularly in areas with few alternatives, the free program is essential for them to maintain employment. Despite bipartisan support among voters, the program has faced federal funding freezes and staffing cuts under the Trump administration, creating uncertainty for families and local economies that depend on it.

          <p>As a government shutdown deadline approaches, Republican congressional leaders are pushing back against Democratic demands to include an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies in any funding deal. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated that while they are open to debating the healthcare subsidies, the immediate priority must be to keep the government open. They argue the ACA issue can be resolved before its year-end expiration, framing the Democratic stance as holding the government hostage over a separate policy debate.

          <p>The new film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, has claimed the top spot at the box office with a domestic debut of $22.4 million. The adult drama, loosely based on a Thomas Pynchon novel, met industry expectations and marks another success for Warner Bros. Despite questions about its appeal to casual moviegoers, the film benefited from strong critical reviews, a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score, and significant awards buzz. The solid opening weekend performance is seen as a positive sign for adult-oriented dramas, which have struggled to attract audiences in the post-pandemic era.</p>

As a result of the withdrawal, the match has been declared a half, with each team receiving half a point.

This was the second time the issue was put to a national vote, after a 2021 proposal was rejected over concerns that private companies would control the data. The revised, approved plan ensures the system remains state-controlled, with data stored only on users' smartphones, and its use will be optional.

          <p>European steel producers are expressing concern that the United States may continue to expand its list of "derivative" products subject to punitive tariffs, creating further uncertainty for the industry. The US has already applied tariffs to hundreds of product categories that contain steel, from furniture to wind turbines, and recently opened a new consultation to potentially add more items. Business leaders and politicians fear this ad-hoc expansion could impact a wide range of manufactured goods, including motorcycles and window frames, adding costs and turbulence to an already strained transatlantic trade relationship.</p>

          <p>A crush at a political rally in the Karur district of Tamil Nadu, India, has resulted in the deaths of at least 40 people, including nine children. The incident occurred during a campaign event for actor-turned-politician Vijay, where tens of thousands of people had gathered, far exceeding the number for which permission was granted. The crowd surged suddenly while Vijay was addressing the rally, leading to the deadly stampede. Police have filed a case against senior members of Vijay's TVK party for homicide and negligent conduct, and the state's chief minister has announced an inquiry and compensation for the victims' families.</p>

          <p>The German government is planning to open direct negotiations with the Taliban to establish a process for deporting Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or considered security threats back to Afghanistan. According to Germany's Interior Minister, officials are set to travel to Kabul in October to discuss the arrangement, which would utilize commercial flights for repatriations. This move signals a significant policy shift, as Germany currently has no formal diplomatic ties with the ruling Taliban and has previously relied on intermediaries like Qatar for deportations. The plan aims to make deportations to Afghanistan a more regular and systematic process.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching a forthcoming batch of U.S. jobs data, which will be critical in shaping expectations for the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy for the remainder of the year. Key reports, including the September nonfarm payrolls, will influence whether the central bank proceeds with one or two more rate cuts. The market's direction is also contingent on whether Congress can avert a government shutdown, with a funding deadline on Tuesday. President Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders, but with Republicans unwilling to make concessions on a short-term bill, the outcome remains a significant wildcard for the markets.

          <p>UK Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain, labeling the policy as both "racist" and "immoral." Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer argued that the plan, which could lead to the deportation of people legally residing in the UK, would "rip this country apart." While he criticized the policy itself, he suggested that many Reform supporters are not racist but are instead frustrated with years of Conservative government failure. The comments come as Starmer faces internal questions about his leadership amid sliding poll ratings for the Labour party.</p>

          <p>China is pioneering an industrial "pull system" designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of automobile manufacturing. This emerging model contrasts with the traditional aerospace "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and excess inventory. In the new system, final assembly lines will "pull" components from suppliers only when they are needed, aiming to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the exponentially growing global space industry in the coming decades.</p>
