          <p>The 1960s British band The Zombies experienced a tumultuous journey to fame, marked by early success with their hit "She's Not There," followed by financial struggles and a breakup. Their album "Odessey and Oracle," initially a commercial failure, gained a cult following over time, largely due to the sleeper hit "Time of the Season." Decades later, the surviving members have finally received widespread recognition for their influential work, culminating in their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and renewed appreciation for their music.</p>

          <p>President Trump's directive to send federal troops to Portland, Oregon, has been met with strong opposition from state and local officials, including Governor Tina Kotek. Leaders argue there is no need for military intervention, calling the move an unwanted and counterproductive "show of force" that could harm the city's economy and inflame tensions. They draw parallels to the 2020 federal deployment, which they state only compounded harm, and insist that local law enforcement is effectively managing the situation without federal overreach.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be avoided as a Tuesday funding deadline approaches. Following President Trump's agreement to meet with bipartisan congressional leaders, Jeffries emphasized the Democratic goal of finding common ground to pass a spending agreement that meets the needs of Americans. A primary point of contention remains the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats are pushing to include in any funding deal to prevent a shock to struggling families.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing their own air quality sensors to monitor pollution in their communities, which are often disproportionately affected by poor air quality. This citizen-led initiative aims to collect localized data to fill gaps left by official government monitoring networks and to advocate for stronger environmental protections. The movement is gaining urgency as the Trump administration moves to roll back numerous pollution regulations, prompting communities to take action to protect their own health.</p>

          <p>The United States has achieved remarkable progress in urban fire safety over the past four decades, cutting the per-capita civilian fire death rate by approximately two-thirds since 1980. This significant improvement is not due to a single breakthrough but rather an accumulation of smaller, crucial advancements. Key factors include the widespread adoption of functional smoke alarms, the increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, safer furniture materials, and a substantial decline in cigarette smoking, all contributing to making homes and buildings far less vulnerable to deadly fires.</p>
