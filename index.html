        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's access to a system tracking student visa applications. Trump stated that Harvard has acted appropriately during negotiations and that a settlement could be historically significant. This follows previous actions by the Department of Homeland Security to potentially revoke Harvard's student visa system certification due to alleged antisemitism on campus, and Trump's order barring most international students from studying at Harvard. The legal battles have implications for Harvard, where a significant portion of the student body comes from outside the United States.</p>

The photos depict key pieces of evidence, including Suzanne's recovered mountain bike, a spy pen used to record conversations, text messages revealing marital struggles, and images of Barry Morphew's truck and belongings. The article highlights the investigation's focus on Barry, including suspicious phone activity and multiple trash runs, as well as the discovery of mysterious DNA evidence. While Barry was initially charged with murder, the charges were later dropped, only to be reinstated five years after Suzanne's disappearance.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's parents have spoken out after their daughter's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, a Boston police officer. The parents expressed a mix of relief and lingering uncertainty, acknowledging the emotional toll the two-year legal battle took on their family. They praised Karen's strength and active involvement in her defense, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" on the case. Despite the acquittal, the family recognizes that the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, a reality they hope will one day be resolved.</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as belonging to the Denisovan species. Researchers used dental calculus to extract DNA from the 146,000-year-old skull after previous attempts to extract DNA from a tooth failed. The analysis revealed that the skull is the first intact Denisovan specimen discovered to date. Denisovans, closely related to Neanderthals, coexisted with modern-day humans. This discovery provides valuable insights into human evolution and the relationships between different hominin species.</p>

          <p>A recent border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has presented a challenge for China's neighborhood diplomacy, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a region crucial to its strategic interests.

The clash, which resulted in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, a key trade gateway for China.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated that they denied entry to federal immigration agents seeking access to their stadium, amidst increased ICE activity and related protests in the city. ICE denied that its agents were at the stadium, with the Department of Homeland Security stating other personnel were in the stadium parking lot "very briefly". The team later announced a $1 million donation to assist immigrant families impacted by recent enforcement actions. The team's action and donation highlight the tensions surrounding immigration policies in Los Angeles and the Dodgers' engagement with their diverse fan base.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and permanent resident of the US, has been released from federal immigration jail in Louisiana after 104 days in custody. US District Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered Khalil's release, citing a lack of evidence that he posed a flight risk or danger to the public. Khalil's legal team has argued that he is not antisemitic or anti-US. The Trump administration had detained Khalil on foreign policy grounds, but Fabiarz had earlier ruled that the foreign policy reasons did not justify his detention.</p>

The Canal and River Trust is spending thousands of pounds retrieving the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot. The Environment Agency says electric bikes pose a pollution risk because the batteries contain substances that can enter a watercourse if they remain submerged in water. Lime does not require customers to physically lock up the bikes - meaning they can be moved around and even ridden without paying.</p>

Stylists suggest that wearing shorts to the office is overwhelmingly based on context. Factors such as company culture, client-facing roles, and the type of shorts all play a role in determining whether or not shorts are acceptable. Although some companies have embraced casual attire, others still maintain expectations of professional dress, leaving employees to navigate the ambiguity of modern office fashion.</p>
