          <p>A new study indicates that immunotherapy could potentially replace chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation for some cancer types. Nearly 80% of patients with various cancers were successfully treated with immunotherapy alone, with a 100% success rate for rectal cancer patients in the trial. The treatment utilizes checkpoint inhibitors to unmask tumor cells, allowing the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy them. This approach aims to reduce the negative impacts of traditional cancer treatments, like infertility and impaired bodily functions, offering a potentially less invasive and more effective option for certain patients.</p>

The study analyzed seismic and flood modeling, finding that this subsidence could affect more than double the number of people, structures, and roads currently at risk. The effect will worsen over time due to sea level rise, emphasizing the need for coastal planners to consider long-term reshaping and sinking of the coastline in addition to shaking and tsunami waves.
