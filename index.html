          <p>Mark Bray, a Rutgers University professor known for his work on anti-fascism, experienced flight cancellation issues while attempting to travel to Spain with his family, shortly after Donald Trump held a roundtable on the impact of antifa activists. Bray, who has received death threats and has been labeled "Dr. Antifa" by some students, was relocating to Europe for safety reasons. Following Kirk's assassination, right-wing figures and Turning Point USA activists have targeted Bray, accusing him of being a "domestic terrorist professor" and calling for his dismissal from Rutgers. Bray denies being part of any antifa group, stating his role is that of a professor researching the topic, and the family has rebooked their flight for the next day. The university has stated that they do not comment on personnel or student conduct matters, affirming its commitment to a secure environment for all members of the community. Optimism is cautious given the nature of the threats and political tensions. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a National League Championship Series berth after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in a dramatic Game 4 decided by an error. With the score tied in the bottom of the 11th inning, Phillies pitcher Orion Kerkering fumbled a routine grounder, allowing the winning run to score. The Dodgers' victory marked their eighth NLCS appearance in 13 seasons, while the Phillies faced another disappointing playoff exit despite a strong regular season. The game featured stellar pitching performances and tense moments, culminating in Kerkering's costly mistake. The Dodgers will now face either the Milwaukee Brewers or Chicago Cubs for a chance to play in the World Series. </p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been criminally indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a mortgage loan for a property in Norfolk, Virginia. James, who previously led a civil fraud investigation against Trump, accuses the president of weaponizing the justice system as political retribution. Prosecutors allege that James misrepresented the property as her secondary residence to obtain favorable loan terms, while it was actually used as a rental investment. James's attorney expressed concern that the case is driven by Trump's desire for revenge, and New York Governor Kathy Hochul has called the indictment a weaponization of the Justice Department. </p>

          <p>A federal judge granted a restraining order temporarily blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, citing a lack of credible evidence of an organized rebellion. Judge April Perry found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of recent events in the Chicago area to be unreliable. She also expressed concerns that deploying troops would lead to civil unrest, given the provocative nature of ICE agents' actions. The White House stated that President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets, while Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul praised the judge's decision as an important one for the country. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in a Game 4 walk-off win to reach the National League Championship Series. Andy Pages hit a grounder to the mound, which resulted in a throwing error by Orion Kerkering, allowing the winning run to score. The game was a pitchers' duel early on, with both Tyler Glasnow and Cristopher Sánchez delivering strong performances. The Dodgers rallied in the 11th inning, setting the stage for the game-winning error, and Roki Sasaki contributed three perfect innings of relief.

Scientists believe the ichthyosaur lived about 185 million years ago, a period from which very few ichthyosaur fossils have been found.

          <p>Tron: Ares, the third installment in the Tron franchise, concludes with Julian Dillinger escaping into Dillinger Corp.’s Grid, and the mid-credits scene shows Julian activating his identity disc, resembling the villainous program Sark from the original film. The film also hints at a future link-up with Tron: Legacy, as Ares is shown looking at images of Quorra, an isomorphic algorithm who made her way into the real world. The movie leaves the possibility open for Julian's return as a villain in a future Tron installment. The film’s ending hints that Ares’ story is not quite over, either. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles firefighters did not use thermal imaging to detect lingering embers after a New Year's Day fire in Pacific Palisades, which later flared up to become a destructive inferno. Interim Fire Chief Ronnie Villanueva stated that the technology was not used due to the fire's size, and instead, firefighters cold-trailed the perimeter. Fire experts criticized the decision, stating that thermal imaging is a standard protocol to prevent rekindle fires. The Palisades fire resulted in significant damage and casualties, and the LAFD is facing questions about its response. </p>

          <p>The US has begun purchasing Argentine pesos as part of a controversial $20 billion financial rescue effort aimed at stabilizing the country's currency crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the purchase, emphasizing the strategic importance of a strong, stable Argentina. The move has boosted the peso and Argentine debt but has drawn criticism in the US due to domestic spending cuts. Argentina has faced financial turmoil ahead of midterm elections, and Bessent defended the support, stating it was not a bailout. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that prohibits veterinarians from performing cat declawing procedures, deeming them inhumane. Assembly Bill 867 allows declawing only in cases of medical necessity, such as recurring infections or conditions jeopardizing the animal's health. The California Veterinary Medical Assn. opposed the bill, arguing it limits the scope of the profession, but proponents argue declawing is a barbaric mutilation. The new law aligns California with other cities and countries that have banned the practice. </p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us." Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that Lamar's criticisms of Drake did not amount to defamation because a reasonable listener could not have concluded that the song conveyed objective facts about Drake. Drake alleged that UMG had endangered his life by putting out a song that depicted him as a pedophile and promoted violent retribution. The lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that diss tracks are not meant to be taken as fact. </p>

The US has imposed tariffs ranging from 15 to 40 per cent on several countries in the region. The report cautions against complacency because trade policy uncertainties are still high.

          <p>Firefighters and advocates are raising concerns about a surge in fires sparked by improperly discarded vaping devices, particularly due to lithium-ion batteries. The increase in fires at waste-collection and recycling facilities has been attributed to the "vape effect". Improper disposal of vape products poses a significant threat to the safety of waste-disposal workers and interferes with recycling efforts. Authorities are promoting proper disposal methods and specialized facilities to reduce the number of vape-related fires, and some countries have banned vaping products outright. </p>
