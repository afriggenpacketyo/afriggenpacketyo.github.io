          <p>After 74 years of scientific research and exploration, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in southern Tibet. The initiative, announced by Premier Li Qiang, is set to become the world's most powerful dam, with a planned capacity of 60,000 megawatts, triple that of the Three Gorges Dam. The project's origins trace back to a comprehensive scientific expedition in 1951, which laid the foundational geological and hydrological groundwork. This monumental engineering feat represents a culmination of decades of strategic planning and scientific endeavor by the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>In a poignant tribute, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler has shared his memories of Ozzy Osbourne's final concert, which took place just weeks before the singer's death at age 76. Butler described being shocked by how "frail" his longtime friend appeared during rehearsals, noting Osbourne performed the show seated on a throne. He recalled the emotional but unusual end to the concert, where the band couldn't perform their typical group bow. Butler expressed immense gratitude for their last performance together, celebrating the incredible love from fans and fellow musicians who paid homage to the legendary rock icon.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay award in an upcoming consultative vote, signaling the potential for strike action later this year. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque," especially when compared to higher increases for other public sector workers. With turnout expected to surpass the 50% threshold required for industrial action, the RCN is urging government ministers to enter negotiations over the summer to avert a formal strike ballot. This development follows a similar rejection by the GMB union, amplifying pressure on the health secretary to address pay disputes.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are voicing deep concern over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This independent panel of primary care experts has provided trusted, evidence-based guidelines on disease prevention since 1984, influencing everything from cancer screenings to managing chronic conditions. The potential shake-up follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears that political interference could undermine a cornerstone of American preventive medicine and disrupt insurance coverage mandated by the Affordable Care Act.</p>

The model predicts that global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027, while U.S. exports may increase by 12%. This shift is attributed to other countries rewiring trade relationships away from the U.S. in response to the new 15% tariff framework. The analysis suggests major decreases in imports from nations like China, Canada, and Mexico, potentially impacting product availability and cost for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests this populist shift is influenced by global trends, like Trump's "America First" movement, and fueled by local anxieties over high living costs and perceived social issues related to tourism and foreign residents.

Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a testament to his groundbreaking 19-year MLB career. He was joined by dominant pitcher CC Sabathia, a six-time All-Star and Cy Young Award winner, and formidable relief pitcher Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility. The ceremony celebrated the diverse and impactful careers of these three players who left an indelible mark on the sport.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a surge in demand for their citizenship by investment (CBI) programs, which offer a passport to individuals who purchase property. Nations like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and St. Lucia are attracting a growing number of US citizens, reportedly driven by political and social volatility at home. For a minimum investment starting around $200,000, buyers gain a passport with visa-free access to up to 150 countries, including the UK and Europe. While these programs are a significant revenue source for the islands, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over security and financial crime concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods and preventing a feared trade war. The deal, announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, also includes major commitments from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy products and invest $600 billion in the American economy. While the 15% tariff is higher than pre-Trump rates, the agreement provides stability and avoids the threatened 30% rate, marking a crucial de-escalation in transatlantic trade tensions.

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This measure is intended to create safe land routes for the United Nations and other agencies to address a severe hunger crisis in the territory. The move comes after months of warnings about a potential famine and increasing international pressure on Israel to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe. While aid agencies welcomed the step, they reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach all civilians in need across the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Google has acknowledged that its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to accurately warn millions of people during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey. The system significantly underestimated the quake's magnitude, sending its highest-level "Take Action" alert to only a few hundred phones instead of the 10 million that were in the high-risk zone. Most users received a lower-level warning designed for light shaking. In a research paper, Google cited limitations in its detection algorithms and has since made improvements, but the failure has raised concerns among scientists about relying on such technology for public safety.</p>

He famously retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his academic career teaching mathematics.

These findings challenge the dominant narrative of northern Aryan influence over a Dravidian south, becoming a symbol of Tamil pride.

An Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist, herself a survivor of the regime, embarked on a years-long search for the plane. By tracking down the aircraft and its flight logs, they uncovered irrefutable evidence of its use in the murder of political prisoners, including a group of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in the Formula 1 championship battle with his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. Piastri secured the win by taking the lead from Norris at the start, capitalizing on the slipstream advantage at Spa-Francorchamps and demonstrating superior bravery through the Eau Rouge corner. While Norris mounted a strong chase, a few small errors, including a slower pit strategy and minor lock-ups, cost him crucial time. The race analysis suggests that while the outcome was largely decided by track position at the start, a perfect race from Norris might have created a closer battle in the final laps.</p>
