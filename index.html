          <p>Premiership Rugby bosses have voiced concerns over the proposed R360 rugby event, questioning its viability and potential impact on the existing rugby structure. The R360 plans to run in two blocks, potentially clashing with domestic rugby in Europe and risking the careers of England players. Concerns are also raised about the event's sanctioning, funding, and marketing. Rugby needs roots, not pop-ups, said one executive.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned of the perils facing the world's oceans, including predatory mining, plastic waste, and rising sea temperatures. Guterres urged delegates at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which would protect marine areas in international waters. The treaty aims to regulate activities in two-thirds of the world's oceans, but faces challenges from countries seeking to exploit mineral wealth on the ocean floor. Small island nations are calling on larger nations to prove their commitment to ocean protection.</p>

          <h2>Senators Investigate Company's Potential Profits from Medicaid Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden are investigating Maximus, Inc., a company that administers government benefits, to determine how it might profit from Republican-led cuts to Medicaid. They have sent a letter demanding information about the company's potential financial gains from these cuts. Maximus has a history of removing Americans from Medicaid to boost profits, according to Warren. The senators are concerned that Republican efforts to add red tape to Medicaid will benefit Maximus at the expense of vulnerable Americans.</p>
