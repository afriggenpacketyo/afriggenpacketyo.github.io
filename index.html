          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted Cameron Arnold and Zachary Evetts on terrorism offenses, alleging they orchestrated a violent July 4 attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Alvarado, Texas. The Department of Justice claims the men were part of an "Antifa cell" that extensively pre-planned the assault, which involved vandalizing vehicles and security cameras, and gunfire that injured an Alvarado police officer. The indictment details the group's alleged preparation, including firearm training and encrypted communications, portraying Antifa as a militant enterprise aiming to overthrow the U.S. government. This case, coming after Antifa was labeled a "domestic terrorist organization," highlights significant debates over domestic extremism and the legal classification of such groups.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a revered "founding mother" of NPR, has passed away at 87, leaving an indelible legacy as a pioneering woman in broadcasting. She joined NPR at its inception, initially in tape editing, and quickly became a prominent host for flagship programs like "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition," before transitioning to a special correspondent role. Colleagues universally remember her as a tough, true-to-herself storyteller who passionately explored culture, science, and the humanity in politics, serving as both a mentor and an inspiration. Her distinctive recorded voice still announces floors in NPR's Washington D.C. headquarters, symbolizing her profound and lasting impact on public radio and the industry.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has continued to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, though allowing them to remain under federal control. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that the administration failed to justify the federalization under Title 10, which permits presidential action in cases of rebellion or when regular forces cannot execute U.S. laws. Judges found "insufficient evidence" that ongoing immigration protests in Illinois constituted a rebellion or significantly hampered federal officers' ability to enforce immigration laws. This decision maintains the temporary block on active deployment, underscoring a significant legal challenge to the President's executive authority regarding the use of federalized National Guard troops domestically.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister and other political leaders have criticized the decision to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa due to safety concerns. West Midlands Police classified the game as high-risk, citing current intelligence and past incidents, including violent clashes involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam, linked to antisemitism and the war in Gaza. Critics, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, condemned the ban as unacceptable and urged its reversal, emphasizing the need to ensure Jewish fans' safety and prevent the perception of no-go zones. UEFA stated local authorities are responsible for match security decisions.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on 18 criminal counts related to mishandling classified information. The indictment alleges Bolton shared over a thousand pages of top-secret "diary-like entries" with two unauthorized relatives via non-governmental email accounts and unlawfully retained classified documents at his Maryland home. It further claims his personal email was hacked by a cyber actor linked to Iran, which Bolton allegedly did not fully disclose to federal officials. This indictment makes Bolton the third prominent Trump critic recently charged, fueling debates about political motivations within the legal system and the handling of sensitive government data.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced efforts to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), urging U.S. employers to offer new fertility benefit options separate from standard medical coverage. President Trump also revealed a deal with drug manufacturer EMD Serono to lower the cost of one of its fertility drugs, which will be listed on the government website TrumpRx. These initiatives aim to make it easier for couples to have children, framed by Trump as "very pro-life" despite the Republican party's deep ties to the anti-abortion movement. However, the plan lacks mandatory employer participation or government subsidies, leaving its overall effectiveness in increasing IVF access and affordability uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled two key initiatives to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), a procedure often costing tens of thousands of dollars and frequently uninsured. The administration secured a deal with EMD Serono, the world's largest fertility drug manufacturer, to significantly reduce prices for its IVF therapies, including Gonal-f, which will be available on TrumpRx.gov by January 2026. Additionally, new guidance will be issued to encourage employers to offer fertility benefits, structured similarly to vision or dental coverage.

It cites the Trump administration's expansion of executive power, politicization of civil service, erosion of judicial independence, and undermining of civil society and the press as key indicators.

The story depicts a future where an imperial president, empowered by unchecked authority, corporate influence, and technological failures, leads to economic collapse and political chaos. Sedgwick's narrative, written as a bitter commentary on the expansionist and materialistic America of his time, culminates in a contested election, violence, and the rise of a new, equally corrupt order.

          <h2>White House Plans for 'Arc de Trump' Monument Spark Discussion on Presidential Legacy and D.C. Development</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly planning an "Arc de Trump," a triumphal arch to be built across from the Lincoln Memorial, intended to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary next year. This privately funded project, inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, is part of Trump's broader vision for redesigning Washington D.C., which also includes a gilded White House makeover and a $250 million ballroom. Developing a new memorial in the capital is a complex process, typically requiring congressional approval and adherence to a multi-step plan from the National Capital Planning Commission. Experts suggest such a project would normally take years, making its completion by next year's anniversary highly unlikely due to legal and logistical hurdles.</p>

          <p>Johnson & Johnson faces a joint legal claim from over 3,000 individuals in the U.K., seeking more than £1 billion for cancers and diseases allegedly caused by asbestos-contaminated talcum powder. The lawsuit, similar to thousands in the U.S., asserts J&J knew about carcinogenic fibers in its products for over 50 years but continued sales for profit. The company only withdrew talc-based products from Britain in 2023, years after doing so in North America. J&J's former consumer health business, Kenvue, denies the claims, stating its baby powder was compliant and safe. This case highlights a major corporate accountability battle over public health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B worker visas. The administration's plan aims to rework the program, which allows U.S. companies to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in fields like technology and engineering. The Chamber argues the fee is unlawful, overriding existing immigration law that bases fees on processing costs, and will make the program prohibitively expensive for businesses, especially startups and midsize companies. This legal challenge highlights a significant conflict between the administration's push to limit immigration and the stated needs of American businesses for access to global talent to foster growth.

Zions Bancorporation reported a sizable charge due to bad loans from a couple of borrowers, and Western Alliance Bancorp alleged fraud by a borrower, despite reaffirming its guidance. These incidents, following recent bankruptcies of auto industry-related companies, have intensified concerns about loose lending practices, particularly within the opaque private credit market. Analysts warn that investors are "looking for cockroaches," indicating a low tolerance for credit hiccups.

President Trump also acknowledged authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela and considering land strikes against drug traffickers.
