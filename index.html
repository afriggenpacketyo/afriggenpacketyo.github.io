          <p>London's public transportation is experiencing severe disruptions as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union commence a five-day strike over pay and fatigue management. The walkout is expected to result in little to no service on most Underground lines, significantly impacting commuters and major city events, including forcing the rescheduling of two Post Malone concerts. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay increase but rejected the union's demand for a reduced 32-hour work week, deeming it unaffordable. This action represents the most significant network-wide strike since March 2023.</p>

The event, founded by Sir Brendan Foster, drew over 200,000 spectators and featured notable participants like fitness coach Joe Wicks and boxer Tommy Fury. Sir Brendan highlighted the event's growing popularity and demographic shifts, noting that female participation has risen from 8% in the first race to 49% last year.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his decision to step down, citing mounting pressure following his party's failure to secure a majority in a recent lower house election. Ishiba stated his resignation was timed with the delivery of a U.S. tariff agreement, a key policy point for his administration. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been struggling with internal divisions, declining public support due to inflation, and past political scandals. The party's report on its election losses pointed to a failure to connect with younger voters and effectively address economic concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump sparked outrage with a social media post that appeared to threaten military action and mass deportations in Chicago, using an AI-generated image parodying the film "Apocalypse Now." The post, which referenced his recent renaming of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War," drew sharp criticism from Democratic leaders, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Illinois Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. They accused the president of using troops as political pawns and threatening an American city. The incident escalates tensions over the potential deployment of the National Guard to Chicago.</p>

          <p>China has sent Y-20 military transport aircraft to deliver emergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following a series of powerful earthquakes that have devastated the country. The initial shipments consist mainly of essential supplies such as tents and blankets, with more aid expected to follow. The earthquakes have resulted in over 2,200 fatalities and more than 3,600 injuries, causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. Beijing's foreign aid agency has allocated 50 million yuan (approximately US$7 million) in emergency assistance at the request of officials in Kabul.</p>

          <p>The company Pray.com is generating both praise and controversy for its "AI Bible" project, which uses artificial intelligence to create cinematic video depictions of biblical stories. These videos, which often resemble scenes from action movies or video games, have gained significant traction online, particularly with younger, male audiences. While the company defends the approach as engaging "edutainment," some theologians are critical, arguing that it reduces complex scripture to mere entertainment and strips it of its spiritual power. The debate highlights the growing intersection of advanced technology and religious expression.</p>

          <h2>Total Lunar Eclipse to Create "Blood Moon" Visible Across Parts of the UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to create a spectacular "Blood Moon" visible to sky-watchers in many parts of the United Kingdom and across the globe. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish hue. This coloring is caused by Rayleigh scattering, the same effect that produces red sunsets. While visibility in the UK will vary by location due to moonrise times, the event offers a chance to witness celestial mechanics in action, with the next similar eclipse not visible in the region until 2026.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis was a tech-savvy youth who used his skills to create websites documenting religious miracles to spread Catholic teachings. His canonization process was notably fast-tracked, seen as an effort by the Vatican to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. His baptismal church in Chelsea, London, has now become a pilgrimage site, housing a relic containing a strand of his hair.</p>

His appointment marks a significant political shift, displacing the long-dominant Shinawatra dynasty after former Prime Minister Paetongtam Shinawatra was removed by a court order. Anutin secured the position with the backing of the main opposition People's Party, under the condition that he will dissolve parliament and call for new elections within four months.

He is accused of carrying out two bombings in California in 2003, which were claimed by an animal rights extremist group. After a high-speed chase in 2003, San Diego vanished, eventually being discovered 21 years later living under an alias in a remote cottage in Wales. Former FBI agents involved in the original case have reflected on what they describe as "missed opportunities" to apprehend him before his disappearance.</p>

While the ECB is expected to keep interest rates on hold, President Christine Lagarde will likely face questions about market stability. Analysts are also watching for a key sovereign debt rating review for France by Fitch as a potential inflection point for investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is advancing its military capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost, long-range attack drones as an affordable alternative to more expensive cruise missiles. The initiative is reportedly being pursued in collaboration with U.S. defense company Kratos, signaling deepening cooperation on emerging military technologies. According to Taiwanese media, these new suicide drones are designed to have a range of at least 1,000 kilometers. This would give Taiwan the ability to strike targets deep within mainland China, including major cities, thereby enhancing its strategic deterrent capabilities.</p>

The game exposed many of the same weaknesses seen in their season-opening defeat, including a slow start, defensive lapses, and an offense that struggled to find its rhythm until the final quarter. A late comeback attempt was thwarted by a tipped-pass interception with under a minute remaining. The disappointing performance against a Mountain West opponent has intensified pressure on second-year coach DeShaun Foster to address the team's recurring problems.</p>
