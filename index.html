            <h2>Mortgage Rates Spike Amid Tariff-Induced Bond Market Volatility</h2>

            <p>Mortgage rates have jumped to over 7% due to President Trump's tariffs impacting the bond market, reaching the highest level since mid-February. The market initially reacted to tariff announcements, with yields spiking and then dropping as Trump adjusted rates, but bonds began selling off again despite a cooler inflation report. Consumer sentiment has also dropped substantially, with inflation expectations reaching levels not seen since 1981, affecting the spring housing market. This situation is creating uncertainty for consumers, as a home is most people's single largest investment, and for the housing market, which is likely to weaken due to higher rates and job market concerns.

Nvidia's gains are particularly notable, heading for its best week since September, while Apple had its best day since 1998, signaling renewed investor confidence in the tech sector despite ongoing trade tensions. This rebound suggests that investors are betting on the long-term growth potential of technology companies, even amidst short-term economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amid recent trade actions by President Trump, economic advisor Stephen Miran hinted at establishing a new global economic order beyond tariffs. Miran suggested reforming the international economic system, possibly devaluing the dollar or compensating the U.S. for its role. Some believe this motivates Trump's aggressive tariff policy to strengthen negotiations for a grand bargain. The reserve currency status of the dollar offers benefits like sanctioning power and lower interest rates, but Miran views it as a burden causing currency distortions and trade deficits, potentially necessitating a "Mar-A-Lago Accord" summit.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, but they also said Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. The government has conceded Mr Garcia was deported due to an "administrative error", though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. Judge Xinis has ordered daily updates on the steps being taken to bring Mr Garcia back to the US.</p>

            <p>The number of measles cases reported in the U.S. has surged, topping 90 in a single week for the first time in years, with multiple states reporting outbreaks. The CDC reports that at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed this year, the second-highest number since the 1990s, prompting concerns about a potential public health crisis. Health officials are advising travelers to affected areas to get vaccinated, highlighting the role of international travel and low vaccination coverage in the outbreaks. HHS Secretary Robert F.

            <p>UnitedHealth is aggressively seeking repayment of loans it issued to struggling doctors after last year's cyberattack on Change Healthcare. Despite CEO Andrew Witty's earlier assurances that repayments would only be required when practices' cash flow normalized, doctors are now facing demands to immediately repay large sums. UnitedHealth is threatening to withhold future claims payments if doctors do not comply, leading to financial strain and legal concerns among affected practices. The cyberattack compromised data from around 190 million Americans, and the ensuing disruption caused severe fallout across the health-care system.</p>

            <p>Teachers in England have expressed their willingness to strike over the government's proposed 2.8% pay rise, which they deem insufficient to address recruitment and retention challenges. An informal ballot revealed that a majority of teachers rejected the offer and would support industrial action to secure a higher, fully funded pay award. While the government insists school funding is increasing, teaching unions argue that the proposed pay rise is inadequate and risks exacerbating the existing crisis in the profession. The potential strike action could disrupt schools and impact parents, similar to previous strikes in 2023.</p>

            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is taking a firm stance in the trade war with President Trump, signaling China's willingness to withstand economic pain. Xi aims to demonstrate that China can resist America's "bullying" and reduce reliance on the United States. Experts suggest that Xi believes other countries will seek trade with China due to the uncertainty created by tariffs. China has various retaliatory measures available, including restricting trade and limiting exports of critical materials.</p>
