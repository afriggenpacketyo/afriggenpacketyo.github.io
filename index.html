          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:01:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, despite him being only two years into a five-year contract. This potential sale is linked to the club's interest in signing RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, a move that would marginalize Hojlund. While Hojlund has expressed his desire to stay, the club may need to sell players to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. A sale at this price would represent a financial loss for United, as the player's book value is £43 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta Platforms is signaling a more cautious approach to its open-source AI strategy, which contrasts with China's rapid advancements in the field. This shift comes as experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem is helping it gain on the US in AI development. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently released powerful new open-source models, claiming top performance benchmarks. Meta's Llama family has been a major proponent of open-source AI, but this change in direction suggests a strategic pivot in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, offering a personal commitment from himself and President Trump to work towards their release. The meeting occurred during a protest in Tel Aviv where families urged the Israeli government to secure a deal, nearly 22 months into the war. The visit follows the release of distressing videos of hostages by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, heightening fears for their well-being. Witkoff also toured a humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza, which has become a flashpoint of violence and desperation.</p>

          <p>An annual cleanup event at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and lost items. Staff members discovered a range of unusual objects, including an old iPod Nano, a hamburger flipper, and a message in a bottle containing a COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that while many items were trash, larger pieces were recycled or upcycled, and in rare cases, valuables like an engagement ring have been reunited with their owners. The effort highlights the importance of preserving natural spaces shared with wildlife, as employees also encountered a family of moose.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released after two months in ICE detention. She was detained in May during what was supposed to be a routine green card interview, despite having recently given birth and being a nursing mother. Her case drew attention to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which has seen a significant increase in arrests. After advocacy from her husband, her attorney, and the office of Senator John Kennedy, she was released on bond and is now reunited with her family, though she still faces further immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gesture but died just before arriving in England. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by students and museum staff reveals that the platypus likely succumbed to overheating, as ship logs show water temperatures in its enclosure rose well above the safe threshold for the species while crossing the equator.</p>

It questions traditional conservative foreign policy stances in the context of the current administration's direction.

This move aims to disrupt people-smuggling gangs that, according to the Home Office, use social media to market their services.

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, has confirmed it has opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into President Trump before the 2024 election were politically motivated. The Hatch Act limits the political activities of federal employees. It remains unclear what action the OSC could take if a violation is found, as Smith is no longer a government employee.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to more openly acknowledge its role in the genocide of Sinti and Roma people during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country's public discourse. At a recent commemoration event, Romania's new president and other officials emphasized the need to confront history and combat ongoing racism and right-wing extremism. During the war, Romania, allied with Nazi Germany, deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most perished. The renewed focus on this history, including new school curricula, is seen as a crucial step toward addressing deep-rooted discrimination.</p>

Originally conceived as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on Ethereum, integrating it into their core systems. Founder Vitalik Buterin and other experts reflect on its growth from a cypherpunk ideal to an invisible backbone for Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old Tennessee man has been arrested and charged with multiple counts of attempted murder after allegedly threatening public officials and possessing 14 explosive devices in his home. Authorities say Kevin Wade O'Neal made threats against officials and law enforcement personnel. When deputies arrived at his Polk County residence to arrest him, they discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device. Investigators believe O'Neal attempted to detonate the explosives while officers were on the scene, leading to nine counts of attempted first-degree murder for the officers present.</p>

          <p>Police officers in England and Wales are set to receive a 4.2% pay increase, an amount slightly above the current inflation rate. However, the Police Federation, which represents over 145,000 officers, has criticized the award as "barely treading water." The federation argues that the raise is insufficient to reverse over a decade of real-terms pay cuts or to address crises in officer retention and mental health. While the government framed the increase as a sign of gratitude, the federation stated it would consult its members on whether to accept or reject the offer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has stated that the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza remains "very insufficient" to alleviate the ongoing crisis, despite recent airdrops. This assessment followed a meeting of German ministers, where they discussed increasing pressure on Israel to ensure full aid delivery.

The diplomatic and humanitarian efforts are set against a backdrop of increasing desperation, highlighted by a new Hamas video showing a visibly frail Israeli hostage.</p>

The bar's owners have denied the claims, stating they are false and are draining the business emotionally and financially.

          <p>Hamas has formally rejected calls for its disarmament, stating that it will not lay down its weapons unless an independent and fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital is established. This declaration is a direct response to a key Israeli condition in ceasefire negotiations and remarks attributed to a U.S. envoy. The statement comes as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have stalled and several Western nations have signaled moves toward recognizing a Palestinian state. Israel's military has warned that fighting will continue if a hostage deal is not secured quickly.</p>
