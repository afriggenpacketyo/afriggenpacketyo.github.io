          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated he will not drop out of the mayoral race. His announcement follows a report that former President Trump's advisors were considering offering Adams a U.S. ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia to clear the electoral field. The alleged strategy aims to consolidate opposition against the Democratic front-runner, Zohran Mamdani, potentially boosting the chances of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. Adams dismissed the speculation, asserting his commitment to his campaign and his confidence in defeating Mamdani.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense to its pre-1947 name, the Department of War. The administration states the change is intended to "project strength and resolve," with officials arguing it better reflects a focus on a "warrior ethos." The move, which is initially a secondary title pending congressional approval, has drawn criticism from Democrats who call it a childish idea that promotes war rather than its prevention. The rebranding is expected to be a costly overhaul affecting numerous agencies, emblems, and uniforms.</p>

Campbell's status for the upcoming season opener is currently listed as questionable due to an ankle injury. He was selected fourth overall in the NFL Draft with the expectation that he will be the franchise's cornerstone blindside protector for years.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after Thomas Tuchel was appointed as the manager of England's national football team, analysts are still assessing the team's identity and tactical direction. Having managed only four games, Tuchel's tenure has seen fewer matches and debut players compared to his predecessors over a similar timeframe. The article examines his tactical shifts, including a preference for a 4-4-1-1 formation and a more physically imposing, ball-dominant style of play. While some statistics show signs of a more aggressive approach, the overall performance is still under scrutiny ahead of upcoming World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's effort to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration's attempt to revoke legal protections and work permits for these individuals. In his ruling, Chen criticized the "unprecedented" manner and speed of the decision by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, stating it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Justice Department is expected to appeal the ruling, which impacts a program designed to protect migrants from countries facing war or natural disasters.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial experts are advising investors to consider strategies for protecting their portfolio gains. The market's bullishness, coupled with a weakening labor market and uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy, suggests potential volatility ahead. Strategists recommend re-evaluating over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which now constitute a significant portion of the S&P 500. They suggest it may be time to begin shifting some capital toward defensive sectors and value stocks that have not participated as much in the recent rally. (not investment advice)</p>

After removing gains in healthcare and social assistance, many sectors showed stagnant or declining job growth, including a loss of 12,000 manufacturing jobs.

The suspects are being charged as adults with first-degree murder. Authorities stated that Tarpinian-Jachym was an "innocent bystander" struck by stray bullets when the suspects allegedly opened fire on two people on bicycles. The high-profile case was previously cited by President Trump as a reason for deploying National Guard troops to the capital as part of a federal law enforcement intervention.</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty pilot who attempted to shut down the engines of a passenger flight in October 2023, has pleaded guilty to federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Emerson was riding in the cockpit jump seat when he tried to pull the fire suppression handles, an action that would have cut fuel to the engines. He has stated that he was suffering from depression, had not slept in over 40 hours, and believed he was in a dream. As part of a plea agreement, he is also expected to plead no-contest to state charges, with conditions including probation and community service.</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler on August 1 has deepened, with a review of her real estate records revealing apparent inconsistencies regarding her primary residence. While Kugler attributed this to a clerical error by the county, the situation has drawn scrutiny amid a broader political campaign by the Trump administration targeting another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, over similar allegations. Kugler's departure allowed President Trump to nominate a successor, raising concerns that her resignation may have been influenced by political pressure aimed at reshaping the Fed's board.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching EU competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google illegally favored its own online advertising exchange, AdX, over rivals, which harmed competitors and publishers. This is the third time the EU has fined the tech giant for anticompetitive behavior, and the regulator noted the penalty was increased due to the repeated offenses. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, while President Trump criticized the fine as "very unfair" to an American company.</p>
