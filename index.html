          <p>Emerging market stocks are gaining traction as confidence in U.S. assets diminishes, fueled by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed optimism towards emerging markets, citing factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, China's economic recovery, and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a shift in investor sentiment. Despite some rebound in U.S. equities, the Moody's downgrade has reignited concerns among traders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has criticized the Trump administration for attempting to deport eight migrants to South Sudan, a country most of them were not from, stating it "unquestionably" violated a court order. The migrants, with criminal records, were placed on a deportation flight with little notice, denying them the opportunity to contest their removal. The judge ordered the administration to retain custody of the deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews. The Justice Department argued the judge's orders were not specific enough, leading to a "misunderstanding."</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is nearing a House vote after approval by the House Rules Committee, though its fate remains uncertain due to divisions within the Republican party. The bill aims to boost small businesses, farmers, and low- and middle-income families while reducing government waste, fraud, and abuse. Negotiations are ongoing to address concerns from blue state Republicans seeking higher state and local tax deduction caps, and conservatives demanding stricter Medicaid work requirements and repeal of green energy subsidies. The White House has urged an immediate vote on the bill.</p>

          <p>Immigration continues to be a contentious issue in UK politics, with the Labour government, led by Sir Keir Starmer, facing the challenge of addressing public concerns. The BBC article discusses the historical context of immigration debates in Britain, highlighting key events like the 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech. While attitudes towards immigration have softened, hostility remains concentrated among certain groups. Starmer's government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, has implemented stricter visa rules, but faces the challenge of balancing economic needs with public sentiment.</p>

          <p>President Trump surprised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with widely discredited claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa during a White House meeting. Trump played a video and handed Ramaphosa print-outs of stories of white people being attacked. Ramaphosa responded by stating that the government policy is against such actions and that the political speeches shown were not government policy. He also pointed out the white members of his delegation, emphasizing that they would not be present if there was a genocide.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats say it is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California was granted the ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. The vote is expected to impact cities and states around the country that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

This amounts to a 40% budget cut for Feeding South Florida, resulting in empty shelves and increased desperation among families.
