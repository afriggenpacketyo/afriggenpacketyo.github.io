          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, following no grand prize winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion drawing. This now stands as the sixth-largest jackpot in lottery history, carrying an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The immense prize reflects a continued period without a top winner since May 31, driving ticket sales higher. With drawings held three times a week, the anticipation builds for players hoping to defy the 1 in 292.2 million odds to claim this life-changing sum.</p>

          <p>President Trump reiterated his commitment to pursuing a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, despite mounting uncertainty over direct talks between Presidents Putin and Zelenskyy. He characterized his diplomatic approach as both realistic and optimistic, emphasizing the need for patience to bring key leaders together for real-time negotiations. Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing conflict and casualties, but believes a resolution is attainable, citing his previous claims of ending multiple conflicts during his term. His strategy involves not ruling out any possibilities before such high-level discussions occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court, seeking a swift reversal of an appeals court ruling that found most of President Trump's import taxes to be an illegal use of emergency powers. The government contends this decision casts uncertainty on ongoing foreign negotiations and jeopardizes existing trade deals, emphasizing the significant financial and diplomatic stakes. Conversely, small businesses affected by the tariffs are advocating for a prompt resolution, having already won twice in federal courts. The Supreme Court's decision will be a crucial test of presidential authority in trade policy.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Thursday, influenced by an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite broader economic concerns. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed, though Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also gained, driven by increased household spending, while Hong Kong and mainland China indices saw declines. Global bond markets, including US Treasuries and Japanese bonds, remained in focus amid rising long-dated borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from World Weather Attribution concludes that climate change significantly fueled intense wildfires in Spain and Portugal this summer, making the conditions 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. These fires, which scorched over 640,000 hectares and claimed at least eight lives, highlight the growing severity of hotter, drier, and more flammable conditions globally. Experts emphasize the urgent need for a shift away from fossil fuels and improved forest management to mitigate future catastrophic events. The analysis also linked a preceding Spanish heatwave to climate change.</p>

The findings, from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, suggest potential avenues to reduce US-China tensions. While optimistic about their nation's future and global standing, the Chinese public's preference for coexistence implies a less confrontational stance than often perceived in the West.

          <p>Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas announced that the Navy has restored his retired rank of rear admiral, overturning a 2022 demotion. The demotion followed a Pentagon inspector general investigation into his conduct as White House physician, which alleged "sexual and denigrating" comments and policy violations. Jackson, who served under Bush, Obama, and Trump, denied the allegations, calling them a "political hit job." This decision aligns with a broader trend of the Pentagon offering benefits to Trump supporters.</p>

          <p>A measure allowing Texas residents to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing drugs has advanced to Governor Greg Abbott's desk, aiming to enforce the state's abortion ban. Supporters view it as a crucial tool, while opponents see it as an effort to intimidate providers and encourage vigilantism, likely sparking legal challenges. The bill includes provisions to protect women from liability and prevent men who committed sexual assault from suing, but its potential to damage shield laws in other states remains a significant concern.</p>
