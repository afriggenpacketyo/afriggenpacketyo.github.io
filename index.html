          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by Qatar, intending to potentially use it as the new Air Force One despite warnings and bribery accusations. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the luxury plane, with the Department of Defense ensuring it meets security measures and mission requirements. While Trump called it a "great thing," experts estimate converting the 13-year-old jet could cost over $1 billion and take years. Critics, including Democrats and some Republicans, have raised concerns about national security risks and ethical problems, viewing the exchange as a potential bribe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has emerged as a leader in stream restoration, primarily by implementing simple solutions such as providing clean drinking water for cows and keeping them out of streams. Farmer Grant Victor's decision to fence off his cattle from Horse Creek led to significant improvements, including reduced veterinarian bills and the return of wildlife. As a result of these practices, approximately 100 streams in Oklahoma, once polluted by farmland runoff, have been restored to health. This initiative demonstrates the effectiveness of local solutions in addressing environmental problems and serves as a model for other states.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Speaker Johnson, and House Republican holdouts convened at the White House to address the stalled "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act." Negotiations faltered due to disagreements among Republican hard-liners concerning Medicaid work requirements and state/local tax deduction caps. Johnson remains optimistic about passing the bill, which includes changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and immigration policy, by week's end. Hard-liners, however, are critical of the bill's potential to increase the national deficit, with some seeking steeper Medicaid cuts and elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies. The White House insists on the bill's passage, labeling failure as "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was taken into ICE custody following a traffic stop in Dalton, Georgia. Community members and a Republican lawmaker supported her release, which intensified after the charges were dropped. Despite her release, Arias Cristobal still faces deportation proceedings, reflecting the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown.

          <p>The UK government is actively reviewing potential restrictions or a ban on the private prescription of cross-sex hormones to individuals under 18. This consideration follows the NHS decision to cease prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics for this age group. Health Secretary Wes Streeting is seeking expert advice on the issue, including alternative legal mechanisms to address private and overseas providers. The case for judicial review was rejected, with Lady Justice Whipple noting the complexity of the policy formation and the ongoing review. Keira Bell, who received cross-sex hormones as a teenager, expressed relief at the potential ban.</p>

          <p>The future of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" is threatened by the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, creating a divide among Republicans.

Trump's changing stance on the SALT cap, which he initially supported and later pledged to end, adds further complexity. While some Republicans seek an increase in the SALT cap, fiscal hardliners oppose it, citing concerns about the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>
