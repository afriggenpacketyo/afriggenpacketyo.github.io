          <p>Voters in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, overwhelmingly approved the incorporation of Starbase as an official city, fulfilling Elon Musk's long-held ambition. The area, which houses SpaceX's rocket program and launch site, is now a 1.5 square mile city. While SpaceX officials have remained tight-lipped about the reasons for establishing a company town, Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders cited the need to manage local infrastructure and services. Critics express concern over Musk's increasing control over the region and the potential impact on public access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are experiencing a significant decrease in take-home pay due to increased payroll taxes imposed by President William Ruto's administration, which is desperately trying to raise revenue to keep the government running and pay off the country's foreign debt. New excise taxes have been implemented on various goods and services, further straining the financial resources of citizens. With a large portion of the population living in poverty and high youth unemployment, the tax burden disproportionately affects the salaried workforce. Public discontent is growing due to a lack of visible improvements in public services, leading to fears of renewed protests.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., is presenting a serious challenge to the governing Labour Party and to the opposition Conservatives, potentially disrupting Britain's traditional two-party system. The party made extensive gains in recent local elections, energizing supporters with Farage's vigorous campaigning. While the Conservatives suffered disastrous results due to a flatlining economy, Labour also faced voter dissatisfaction with government spending curbs and higher taxes. The rise of Reform U.K. reflects a broader fragmentation of society and politics, with increasing support for nationalist parties, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's manufacturing sector, heavily reliant on U.S. demand, faces uncertainty as President Trump considers imposing significant tariffs on imports from the country. Factory workers fear job losses and reduced incomes as American retailers begin to cancel orders. The potential tariffs, which could reach 46 percent, would severely impact Vietnam's textile and garment industries, where profit margins are already thin. While Vietnam's government is attempting to negotiate a deal with the Trump administration, the threat of tariffs is already destabilizing the economy and forcing companies to explore alternative markets. </p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private education, while supporters claim it will empower parents to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>
