          <p>Hamas has stated it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as part of ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Alexander, a 21-year-old soldier, is the last known living US citizen being held hostage in the territory. This announcement follows reports of direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar, aimed at securing a truce and facilitating humanitarian aid. A senior Palestinian official indicated that this gesture is intended to foster goodwill before President Trump's visit to the Middle East, with further meetings planned to finalize Alexander's release, contingent on a temporary halt to Israeli military activity.</p>

Gunther dominated much of the match, delivering numerous chops to McAfee's chest, eventually winning by putting McAfee to sleep. McAfee later posted a photo on X showing the severe redness on his chest, acknowledging the match's intensity. Cole pleaded with McAfee to give up during the match.

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a Boeing 747-8 jet as a gift from the royal family of Qatar to serve as Air Force One. The administration intends to retrofit the plane for official presidential use, with the jet later transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation. The move raises legal and ethical questions, though the White House asserts compliance with all applicable laws. This development comes as Trump's previous deal to modernize Air Force One aircraft faces delays and budget overruns. Qatar's Media AttachÃ© to the U.S., Ali Al-Ansari, confirmed that the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg for Washington, D.C. The group of 49, mainly families, is being resettled under an executive order issued by President Trump, who claimed they face "government-sponsored race-based discrimination." The South African government denies any racially motivated discrimination or land confiscations. This initiative contrasts with the Trump administration's general ban on most other refugees entering the U.S., and the processing of these applications has been unusually fast.</p>

Zelensky responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting but also offering to personally attend negotiations in Turkey.

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program has raised concerns among advocates for students with disabilities. The budget aims to limit the federal governmentâ€™s role in education and provide states with greater flexibility, potentially reducing oversight of how states use Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. Advocates fear this could lead to uneven enforcement of IDEA and an erosion of the right to a free and appropriate public education for students with disabilities. The article highlights a case in Oklahoma where a school district allegedly segregated students with disabilities, underscoring the importance of federal oversight.</p>
