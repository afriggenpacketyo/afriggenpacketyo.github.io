          <p>Jurors have started deliberating in the sex trafficking and racketeering trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces a potential life sentence if convicted on the most severe charges. The jury will review seven weeks of testimony, including from ex-girlfriends who alleged violent and coercive sexual encounters, as well as video evidence of an assault. While prosecutors argued Combs used his power and wealth to operate a criminal enterprise, his defense team contended the case is about money and that the sexual acts were consensual. Combs has pleaded not guilty and did not testify in his own defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut off forecasters' access to a critical satellite data program used for hurricane prediction. The decision to suspend the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had sparked alarm among scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited a request from NASA for the delay, stating the original move was intended to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk.

          <p>Mexican authorities discovered twenty bodies, some decapitated, on a highway bridge in the state of Sinaloa, a region plagued by a violent internal war between factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel. The conflict pits loyalists of the captured Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada against a faction led by the sons of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, known as the "Chapitos." Violence in the state has surged since Zambada's capture, with over 1,200 deaths reported. This gruesome discovery highlights the extreme brutality of the ongoing turf war in a country where criminal violence has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives since 2006.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter registration and engagement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The effort aims to learn from the party's 2024 defeats and connect with voters in non-traditional settings, with an initial six-figure investment planned. The program will focus on key battleground districts and states, utilizing thousands of volunteers to communicate the party's message and counter the Republican agenda.

          <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is facing pressure from fellow Labour MPs regarding the government's proposed reforms to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) system. In a partial U-turn, the government announced that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026, and a review of the assessment process will be conducted. However, many backbenchers are questioning the logic of deciding on new criteria before the review is complete. The government was forced to make concessions after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to block the bill, which aims to reform the welfare system.</p>

These factors, combined with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, have diminished the dollar's traditional safe-haven appeal.

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Department of Homeland Security data shows a dramatic rise in the detention of immigrants with no criminal history since May, following a White House push to increase arrests. While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data indicates that only about 8% of all people detained since January have convictions for violent crimes. Since early June, those held solely on civil immigration charges have outnumbered those with criminal records. This shift highlights a broader enforcement strategy where anyone in the country illegally is a potential target for removal.</p>

          <p>The economic relationship between the United States and Canada has been fraught with tension since President Trump took office, marked by repeated tariff threats and fraught negotiations. A timeline of events shows the dispute began with threats of 25% tariffs on all imports, leading to a trade war in March 2025. Subsequent months saw retaliatory tariffs, temporary pauses, and specific levies on industries like auto and steel. The latest flashpoint involves Canada's plan for a Digital Service Tax on U.S. tech companies, which prompted Trump to suspend trade talks before Canada ultimately rescinded the tax to resume negotiations.</p>

          <p>England's victory over India in the first Test was significantly influenced by the performance of fast bowler Josh Tongue, particularly his ability to quickly dismiss India's lower-order batsmen. An analysis highlights that India's last four wickets contributed minimal runs in both innings, with Tongue taking three wickets in each. His aggressive and intimidating bowling style, which dismantled the tail with a triple wicket-maiden in the second innings, is seen as a key art in modern Test cricket. The ability to "kill the tail" is considered a crucial factor for England's future success, especially in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is considering a "temporary pass" to shield immigrant workers in the farming and hospitality industries from a broader immigration crackdown. Speaking on "Sunday Morning Futures," the president acknowledged that aggressive enforcement could harm these sectors by removing long-term workers who are difficult to replace. While reaffirming his strong stance on immigration and the removal of criminals, Trump suggested a system where farmers could have some control and workers could pay taxes. This represents a potential carve-out from the administration's otherwise intensified deportation efforts across the country.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis examines the significant increase in working-age adults in England and Wales claiming disability or incapacity benefits, which has grown from one in thirteen in 2019 to one in ten in 2025. The rise is largely fueled by an increase in claims for mental health conditions, particularly among younger adults. While the exact causes are uncertain, researchers point to factors like the rising state pension age keeping more people in the working-age bracket and potentially better public awareness of benefit entitlement. This trend provides context for the government's controversial, though now scaled-back, plans to reform the benefits system.</p>

Their energetic and highly politicized performances have earned them a growing following and several music awards. The recent incident, involving an anti-IDF chant, aligns with their history of using their music as a platform for confrontational political expression, which the frontman says is a cathartic way to share his experiences.</p>

          <p>Veteran NBA player Malik Beasley, who played for the Detroit Pistons last season, is the subject of a federal investigation into gambling allegations related to NBA games. According to reports, the probe centers on his time with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2023-24 season, when at least one sportsbook reportedly noticed unusual betting activity on his personal statistics. The NBA has confirmed it is cooperating with the investigation being led by the U.S. attorney's office in New York. Beasley's attorney stated that no charges have been filed and urged the public to reserve judgment.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned 3% digital services tax on large technology companies, a move designed to restart critical trade negotiations with the United States. The decision came just hours before the first payments were due and followed a threat from President Donald Trump to terminate the talks, calling the tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Canada's finance minister stated that while the tax was meant to ensure tech giants pay their fair share, a multilateral agreement has always been the preferred approach. The reversal was praised by U.S. officials and business groups. (not investment advice)</p>
