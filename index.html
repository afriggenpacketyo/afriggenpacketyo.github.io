          <p>A student-led movement in Serbia is challenging President Aleksandar Vucic's increasingly autocratic government, demonstrating a remarkable show of solidarity across ethnic and religious lines. The article highlights a moment where Muslim students relieved protesting Christian students during Easter, and a war veteran extended greetings of peace. These protests, sparked by a train station collapse linked to corruption, have grown into the largest and most extensive movement Serbia has seen, calling for accountability and early elections. The government's attempts to quell the protests have failed, with nearly half a million people taking to the streets, showing the movement's deep reach into Serbian society and its potential to inspire similar movements globally.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it will release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. This decision is intended to facilitate a deal for humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade. The Israeli PM's office stated that Alexander's release was made possible due to military pressure on Hamas, and preparations to intensify fighting are still continuing. Trump confirmed Alexander's release, calling it a step taken in good faith, while Alexander's family expressed gratitude and urged further negotiations for the remaining hostages.</p>

The testimony includes allegations of war crimes stretching over more than a decade, implicating the SBS for the first time in the execution of unarmed and wounded people.

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that had contributed to friction between the two countries. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple. After the statue was stolen, South Korean authorities arrested the thieves and confiscated it, but a South Korean temple filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled proposed Medicaid cuts as part of President Trump's plan, aiming to save $880 billion to cover tax breaks. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats warn will result in millions losing coverage. A preliminary estimate from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the proposals would reduce the number of people with healthcare by 8.6 million over the decade. While Republicans argue they are rooting out "waste, fraud, and abuse," Democrats contend the cuts amount to another attempt to repeal Obamacare.</p>

          <p>A US-mediated ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has ended intense hostilities, but experts from both sides express skepticism about long-term peace.

The article suggests that both countries used the conflict to test each other's resolve, recognizing the devastating potential of a full-scale war.

Care homes will also be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad, and migrants will need to wait ten years to become British citizens. Prime Minister Starmer stated that new immigrants have to earn the "privilege, not right" to settle in the UK.

While a joint statement with full details is expected, some experts predict potential cuts to tariffs, although they would remain above historical norms.

His daughter, Sara Duterte, currently the vice president, has seen her approval rating rise, and the election could prove pivotal for her future political ambitions.

By the time the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government came to power in 2010, it had become a sufficiently potent political issue that the Tories promised to "take steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s – tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed new charges against Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon, including additional counts of alleged sexual assault, one of which involves a minor. The charges are part of a superseding indictment that includes more alleged victims, bringing the total to six. The Alexander brothers, prominent real estate moguls, have been accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then drugging and sexually assaulting them. All three have previously pleaded not guilty to the initial charges and face 15 years to life in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>The White House is in discussions with the Qatari royal family about a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One. Qatar's Media Attaché to the US confirmed ongoing negotiations between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense. While Qatar denied the plane would be a gift, they acknowledged discussions about the transfer of an aircraft for "temporary use." The potential value of the plane and its handling are raising legal and ethical questions, and Democrats are urging Congress to look into this potential gift.</p>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad warns that President Trump's unilateral tariffs will hurt Americans more than targeted countries, increasing the U.S. cost of living. He argues that American products cannot compete with cheaper products from the rest of the world, leading to economic suffering. Mahathir believes ASEAN can weather the impact of tariff hikes through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States. He also advocates for peace through dialogue and negotiation rather than retaliation.</p>
