          <p>The White House is defending Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth amidst allegations of sharing details about a planned U.S. strike against Houthis in Yemen. Trump has criticized Zelenskyy's refusal to accept Russian control of Crimea, stating it harms peace negotiations. Billionaire Elon Musk has indicated he will begin to retreat from his government efficiency role, following budget cuts and federal layoffs. Focus remains on the legal battle of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant wrongfully deported by the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines announced it will reduce its capacity in the second half of the year due to signs of weaker domestic bookings, reflecting broader macroeconomic uncertainty. The airline expects unit revenue to be flat to down as much as 4% in the second quarter and is not reaffirming its earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026. This decision follows similar moves by United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have also scaled back domestic capacity and, in Delta's case, pulled its full-year forecast. The airline cites difficulty in forecasting due to recent and short-lived booking trends.</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that these tariffs, including a 145% tariff on products from China and tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, are unconstitutional and will harm American consumers and the economy. The states are seeking a court order to declare the tariffs unlawful and prevent their enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, including those on auto parts from China and levies on steel and aluminum, as confirmed by the White House. Automakers and policy groups have been lobbying for tariff relief, concerned about the compounding costs. The upcoming tariffs on auto parts, scheduled for May 3, have industry officials particularly worried about the potential impact on U.S. automotive production and the financial strain on auto suppliers. Six policy groups representing the automotive industry have jointly urged the Trump administration to reconsider these tariffs.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta is pushing back against Paul Flores's attempt to overturn or reduce his conviction for the 1996 murder of Kristin Smart, calling his claims "meritless." Flores, who is serving a 25-year-to-life sentence, argues that the trial judge abused her discretion, including not dismissing a biased juror and allowing a prejudicial photo to be shown. Bonta's office argues that Flores's claims did not affect his right to a fair trial and do not warrant overturning his conviction. One of the last people to see Smart alive is urging Flores to confess the location of her body.</p>

          <p>The Santa Ynez Reservoir in Pacific Palisades must be drained again after further tears and leaks were discovered in its floating cover during the refilling process. The reservoir had been empty since early 2024 due to tears in the cover, and repairs were thought to be complete. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) expects the repairs to take three to four weeks, delaying the reservoir's return to service until mid- to late June. The delay has frustrated residents, especially after the reservoir was empty during a recent wildfire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is signaling a desire to de-escalate the trade war with China, but faces the challenge of doing so without appearing to back down. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the current high tariffs on China are "unsustainable," and President Trump suggested that the tariffs would be reduced substantially. However, White House aides cautioned that no immediate changes are planned. Trump's trade war, initiated impulsively, is causing economic problems, and Chinese leaders have resisted his threats, viewing them as disrespectful bullying.</p>

Weinstein's lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility, arguing that they had mutually beneficial relationships with Weinstein and were motivated by money.

          <p>Google is requiring some remote workers to return to the office three days a week or risk losing their jobs, as the company tightens restrictions on remote work. Several units within Google have informed remote staffers that their roles may be at risk if they do not comply with the hybrid work schedule.
