          <p>President Trump declared a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, emphasizing increased market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and the reduction of non-tariff barriers. The deal, still being finalized, includes a 10% tariff on imported goods, expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. The U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a boost for trade and job creation, while Britain anticipates tariff cuts on U.K. cars and the elimination of tariffs on steel and aluminum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to meet with a Chinese trade delegation in Switzerland to address ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A mistrial was declared in the case against Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder for the fatal shooting of Patrick Lyoya during a 2022 traffic stop. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, marking a partial victory for Schurr, who may face another trial. The incident, captured on video, showed Lyoya fleeing from Schurr and a subsequent scuffle over the officer's Taser before Lyoya was shot while face-down on the ground. Schurr testified he feared for his life due to the Taser, while Lyoya's family expressed disappointment and vowed to continue fighting for justice.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's focus on attacking federal judges who rule against his policies undermines the rule of law, shifting focus from legal precedent to personal attacks. By delegitimizing the court system, Trump risks overstepping his power and disregarding court rulings, potentially inciting violence against judges. While acknowledging judges are influenced by their experiences and political affiliations, the article emphasizes the danger of prioritizing personalities over the law. Legal experts argue that Trump's demonization of individual judges serves his agenda by diverting attention from the legal merits of cases.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant aimed at training first responders in the use of naloxone, a lifesaving overdose reversal drug, despite recent progress in lowering opioid overdose deaths. Experts credit wider naloxone access for the recent dip in overdose deaths, with the medication now available over-the-counter and carried by first responders. The proposed cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce the Health and Human Services budget, potentially dismantling essential services. Critics argue that these cuts will exacerbate the overdose crisis, undermining proven strategies for saving lives and hindering access to treatment and harm reduction strategies.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced that the National Institutes of Health will use Medicare and Medicaid data to create a "real-world data platform" for identifying the causes of autism. This initiative has raised alarm among the autistic community and privacy experts, who are questioning how the data will be used and protected. Concerns have been voiced regarding the potential for abuse and the sensitivity of patient data, particularly given Kennedy's controversial views on autism and his vow to eradicate the disorder.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced modest gains on Thursday following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom. The S&P 500 rose by 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also increased by 0.6%. The trade deal, which aims to expand market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and reduce non-tariff barriers, boosted investor confidence. However, some analysts caution that market volatility is expected to persist due to ongoing trade uncertainties and potential headwinds from larger trading partners like China.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have finalized an agreement that will reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. While hailed by leaders as a significant development, analysts note that the deal may not substantially alter the terms of trade between the two countries. The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on up to 100,000 cars per year to 10%, while tariffs on steel and aluminum have been slashed. The agreement also includes reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>

Economists note that tariffs are taxes paid by importers, who typically pass on the costs to consumers through higher prices, impacting low- and middle-income households the most.</p>
