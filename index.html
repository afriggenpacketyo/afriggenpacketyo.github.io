          <p>Civil servants across China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to ambiguous and constantly changing local austerity rules, a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma" or adding extra layers of control. An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head implemented a dine-out ban in May, citing that it was "not good for you" during this period. This reflects a broader trend where local anti-corruption measures are becoming even stricter than central government regulations, creating uncertainty and prompting officials to adopt a more cautious lifestyle to avoid scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A massive spending package championed by President Trump passed a critical procedural vote in the Senate late Saturday, moving forward by a narrow 51-49 margin. The vote was dramatic, with three Republican holdouts eventually siding with the majority after hours of uncertainty, narrowly avoiding a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The bill now faces a final Senate vote after Democrats force a full reading of the 940-page document. Its passage remains uncertain as it must also be re-approved by the House, where some Republicans oppose key provisions.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Lake fire, erupted near the Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area in San Bernardino County on Saturday afternoon, rapidly growing to 477 acres. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations and trapped over 100 people who were at the reservoir, forcing them to be evacuated by boaters and park rangers. Witnesses described seeing 100-foot flames, and many campers had to flee with only the clothes they were wearing. Fire crews are battling the fire from the ground and air, and the cause is currently under investigation.</p>

Under the plan, businesses will voluntarily find ways to make healthy options more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. The policy, which is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and reduce pressure on the health service.

President Vucic has accused the protesters of being part of a foreign plot to destabilize the country and has refused calls for a snap election.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities often become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas due to the "urban heat island effect," a phenomenon that exacerbates the impact of heatwaves. Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, slowly releasing it and raising temperatures, especially at night. In contrast, rural areas benefit from the natural cooling effects of vegetation and water. With climate change making heatwaves more frequent and intense, and with a growing majority of the world's population living in urban centers, this effect poses increasing risks like heat stroke and poor air quality.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has sparked protests from hundreds of local residents. Demonstrators marched through the city with banners like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," arguing that the extravagant event highlights the struggles of Venetians who face overtourism, high housing costs, and environmental fragility. Critics view the spectacle as an affront to the city and its citizens. Despite a donation from Bezos to local environmental groups, many protesters dismissed it as an attempt to "clear his conscience" while the city's fundamental problems remain unaddressed.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program is being trialled in primary schools in Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety in an effort to reduce future skin cancer rates. The initiative teaches pupils how to read UV indexes, apply sunscreen correctly, and understand the risks of sun exposure. Melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, is linked to UV damage, and sunburn in childhood significantly increases later-life risk. The program, developed by the Melanoma Fund charity, aims to be rolled out nationwide by 2026, empowering children to protect their own skin.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to a government attempt to ban the march under a controversial "Child Protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, framing the event as a celebration of human rights and solidarity. Many attendees carried banners mocking Orban, transforming the Pride parade into a broader demonstration for freedom and against authoritarianism.</p>
