          <p>Defense Secretary John Healey anticipates UK defense spending will increase to 3% of GDP by 2034, aligning with Prime Minister Starmer's plans announced in February. The government is set to release its strategic defense review, outlining priorities for military and security spending in the coming years, emphasizing the rapidly changing global threat landscape. The review will also recommend deploying digital experts alongside troops to counter enemy drones and manage future unmanned weapons, with over £1 billion invested in developing technology to expedite battlefield decisions. Funding for defense will partially come from reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>

          <p>Torrential monsoon rains in Assam, India, have triggered landslides and floods, resulting in at least five deaths, according to disaster management officials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three women and two physicians are suing to block a Kansas law that nullifies a pregnant woman's advance medical directive regarding end-of-life treatment. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the state's Natural Death Act clause, arguing it violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The plaintiffs assert the law denies pregnant women the same level of certainty and deference afforded to others regarding their healthcare decisions. The physicians claim the law requires them to provide a lower standard of care to pregnant patients, exposing them to potential legal penalties.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has cautioned Asian countries about China's "imminent" threat to Taiwan, advocating for increased defense spending and collaboration with the United States to deter potential conflict. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth characterized China as a hegemonic power aiming to dominate Asia, citing a 2027 deadline allegedly set by President Xi Jinping for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. Hegseth emphasized the devastating consequences any forceful attempt by China to conquer Taiwan would have for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. While the US sent a large delegation, China sent a low-level delegation and canceled its planned speech.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scammers who falsely claim that artificial intelligence can predict questions for the upcoming national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have jointly launched a campaign to investigate and eliminate “illegal and harmful information” related to the exams. With over 13.3 million people taking the test this year, there is a high demand for mock papers, with some sellers falsely claiming AI can predict actual questions, leading to inflated prices. The authorities are also investigating social media accounts and tutors alleging access to “top secret” information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal North Korea has deployed balloon-like objects around its damaged 5,000-ton warship, which has been partially submerged since a failed launch. Experts speculate the objects may be used to help right the ship or shield it from drone surveillance. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has deemed the failed launch a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers’ Party. Analysts suggest the balloons could prevent further flooding or reduce stress on the section of the ship still on the pier, but caution against potential damage from lifting the ship from above.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice hitting store shelves, drawing consumers seeking relief from soaring prices. Major retailers like Ito-Yokado and Iris Ohyama began selling the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, while long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. This initiative aims to curb rising rice prices by selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 directly to retailers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is facing significant challenges in implementing its tariff policies, despite the president's assertion that “tariffs are easy.” A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a legal battle likely to reach the Supreme Court. The administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs has been questioned, with a federal court ruling that it exceeds presidential authority. Although an appeals court temporarily stayed the decision, the legal spats add confusion for businesses navigating the world economy under Trump's policies. (not investment advice)</p>
