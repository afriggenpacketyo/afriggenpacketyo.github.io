          <p>Shares of major Australian rare earths and critical metals companies saw initial gains before retreating following the announcement of an $8.5 billion minerals deal with the United States. The agreement is designed to bolster supply chains for materials crucial to defense and energy, explicitly countering China's market dominance. While some smaller miners and NYSE-listed Alcoa sustained their gains, larger firms like Lynas Rare Earths saw their early rally reverse. The deal includes significant funding and aims to establish a pricing framework to stabilize the volatile global market for these essential resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, ending a period of political uncertainty. Her ascension was secured after her Liberal Democratic Party formed a new coalition with the right-leaning Japan Innovation Party, shifting the governing bloc's political stance. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to pursue a stronger military and constitutional revision. However, she faces immediate challenges, including public frustration over rising prices and the need to stabilize her new, untested coalition to ensure legislative effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Amazon has resolved a major outage of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted a vast array of online services across the globe for most of Monday. The disruption affected social media, gaming, financial platforms, and even Amazon's own services like Alexa and Ring, highlighting modern society's dependence on a few key cloud computing providers. The company attributed the problem to issues with its Domain Name System (DNS) in its eastern U.S. region. The incident caused significant operational problems for numerous companies, including airlines and transit authorities, before services were fully restored by Monday evening.</p>

          <p>Ed Gallrein, a former Navy SEAL backed by Donald Trump, has launched a primary challenge against Republican Representative Thomas Massie in Kentucky's 4th Congressional District. Gallrein is positioning himself as a staunch Trump ally, arguing the former president needs backup in Congress rather than obstacles. The challenge follows Trump's public criticism of Massie, whom he labeled a "Weak and Pathetic RINO" for opposing key legislative efforts. Massie has fired back, calling Gallrein an "establishment hack" and has successfully used the attacks to boost his own fundraising efforts ahead of the primary.</p>

          <p>The massive internet outage on Monday was caused by a common but disruptive Domain Name System (DNS) error within Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing backbone for about a third of the internet. The error, originating from AWS's largest data center in Virginia, essentially made the system lose the 'map' that directs user traffic to websites and apps like Snapchat and Roblox. This event serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with the digital world's heavy reliance on a small number of tech giants, including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, for its core infrastructure.</p>

The return of hostages, both living and deceased, is a central component of the agreement. This event occurred following meetings between U.S. envoys and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aimed at keeping the fragile peace process on track after recent violence.</p>

The professional thieves, who escaped on scooters, stole eight valuable items in approximately eight minutes. Experts believe the perpetrators will dismantle the pieces, melt down the gold and silver, and recut the gemstones to sell them for a fraction of their worth on the black market. This method would make the components virtually untraceable, representing a devastating cultural loss for France, as the jewels are considered part of the national heritage.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.2 billion in September, the highest amount for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase was driven by rising debt interest payments, which offset higher tax revenues, bringing total borrowing for the first half of the financial year to £99.8 billion. The figures intensify the fiscal pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is anticipated to announce tax hikes in the upcoming November Budget to adhere to her own financial rules.

The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offer a promising new avenue for future cancer treatments.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered several new species during a deep-sea exploration in the Gascoyne Marine Park off Western Australia. Among the finds are the West Australian Lantern Shark, a small, bioluminescent shark with large eyes, and a new type of porcelain crab roughly the size of an almond. These discoveries were made during a research voyage by Australia's science agency, CSIRO, which collected hundreds of specimens from largely unexplored waters. The voyage has so far unearthed about 20 new species, with researchers estimating that hundreds more from the expedition are still awaiting scientific description.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exporters at China's Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients requesting to settle trades in the Chinese yuan instead of the U.S. dollar. Customers from Southeast Asian and Central Asian countries are increasingly opting for yuan payments, with some Chinese companies reporting that yuan-settled orders now constitute up to 20% of their total exports, a significant increase from last year. This shift is partly driven by Chinese suppliers leading infrastructure projects, such as data centers, in developing nations. The trend reflects a gradual but noticeable move towards the internationalization of China's currency in global trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After four consecutive defeats, Liverpool's recent poor form has put manager Arne Slot under scrutiny, despite significant investment in new players. The team, which won the league title last season, now appears defensively vulnerable and lacks cohesion in attack, with expensive summer signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak failing to make a significant impact. Key issues facing Slot include the declining form of star player Mohamed Salah, an unsettled forward line, and defensive frailties, particularly at right-back. The manager must quickly find solutions to address these problems and reverse the team's worrying slide.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces are using suicide drones to target Russian soldiers stranded on islands in the Dnipro river delta, a treacherous area described as a "death zone." Reports suggest hundreds of Russian troops are facing starvation and constant attack, with many attempting desperate escapes in small boats, only to be eliminated by Ukrainian drones. The river has become a de facto front line since the liberation of Kherson, with the marshy islands offering poor cover and making resupply efforts extremely hazardous. The brutal encounters highlight the grim reality of this battlefield, where survival is increasingly unlikely for the isolated Russian units.</p>

          <p>An innovative project named "Reefline" is underway off the coast of Miami Beach, creating a seven-mile-long artificial reef that doubles as an underwater art installation. The reef will be composed of a series of sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, including an installation of 22 concrete cars arranged in a traffic jam. These structures will serve as a habitat for transplanted native corals, aiming to restore the reef ecosystem that was lost decades ago. The project, accessible to snorkelers from the beach, combines art, marine science, and ecotourism to revitalize the local marine environment.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have urged the U.S. Supreme Court to maintain a lower court's order preventing the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard into the city. In their brief, they argue that the administration's request relies on "mischaracterizations" of the situation and that state and local law enforcement are capable of handling protest activities. They contend that federalizing the Guard without allowing deployment into Chicago respects the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments. The state argues that allowing deployment would cause irreparable harm.</p>

          <p>A theory known as "winology," developed by Chinese academics, is gaining popularity on social media as a framework for understanding why China's global achievements are allegedly dismissed in the West. The theory posits that Western perspectives are shaped by a hierarchical worldview that unfairly diminishes China's economic and technological advancements. This viewpoint, now being discussed in academic circles, suggests a perceived ranking of peoples that places Chinese contributions at a lower tier. The concept aims to explain the gap between China's rise as a global leader in certain fields and its international recognition.</p>
