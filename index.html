          <p>Following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a Utah state law permitting the open carry of firearms on college campuses is facing renewed national scrutiny. The article examines Utah's broader pro-gun legislative landscape, which includes a lack of red-flag laws and state incentives for K-12 teachers to be armed in their classrooms. It contrasts the deterrence argument from gun-rights advocates with expert opinions suggesting such laws are often ineffective against politically motivated and irrational actors.</p>

          <p>A new profile in Rolling Stone reports that former Trump advisor Stephen Miller was so disliked during his tenure on Capitol Hill that Republican staffers allegedly invented and spread a rumor about him playing with porcelain dolls. The article portrays him as a powerful, shadow figure within the Trump administration who drove controversial immigration policies and earned nicknames like "President Miller." The piece also includes a claim from a childhood friend who alleges Miller ended their friendship due to the friend's Latin heritage.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, University of Chicago professor Robert Pape describes the current U.S. political climate as a watershed moment for an "era of violent populism." He points to a rising trend of political violence and a corresponding increase in public support for it on both the left and right, citing his center's survey data. Pape identifies the nation's generational demographic shift from a white-majority to a white-minority democracy as the primary root cause, which is then accelerated by the internet.</p>

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO country, after Poland, to experience such an incursion in recent days. The drone was detected near the Ukrainian border during Russian attacks on Danube infrastructure, prompting Romanian fighter jets to monitor its path. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the incident an "obvious expansion of the war," while the EU's foreign policy chief condemned it as an "unacceptable breach" of a member state's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, has stated that Prince Andrew needs to be fully investigated over allegations that he sexually abused her. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, said that despite the prince being stripped of his titles, it is not enough and that he should be held to the "fullest extent of the law." Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU party is projected to win, securing around 34% of the vote.

The results are seen as a key test for the national government, with the AfD's gains in western Germany reflecting a broader rightward political shift.</p>
