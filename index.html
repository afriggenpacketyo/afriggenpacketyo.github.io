          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Russia-Ukraine war at the Munich Leaders Meeting in Washington, stating that Russia's demands for concessions are too high for the U.S. to accept. The Trump administration hopes to facilitate direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to establish basic guidelines for future talks, emphasizing the importance of these countries communicating with each other. The U.S. is willing to participate in these conversations to help bring the conflict to a resolution. It is important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another, according to Vance.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have recently surged, reaching $3,400 per ounce in April, driven by investor confidence amid inflation and global tensions. Experts suggest that several scenarios could lead to a price decline, including investors taking profits, a stronger U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure. Despite potential drops, experts advise that investing in gold should be viewed as a long-term strategy for financial protection against debt and currency erosion. The article emphasizes that timing the market is difficult and long-term returns are generally better. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced in Parliament in England and Wales proposes adding up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions, addressing the pain caused to victims' families when offenders are absent. The bill follows campaigns by families of victims whose killers refused to attend sentencing, and it also grants judges additional powers to punish disruptive offenders. The new measures would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who attend proceedings but are removed from court for disruptive behaviour.</p>

          <p>During closing speeches in the trial of two men accused of felling the Sycamore Gap tree, prosecutors argued that the act was considered a "bit of a laugh" by the defendants, who later feared public backlash. The tree, a landmark on Hadrian's Wall, was felled in September 2023, causing widespread outrage. Evidence presented includes phone tracking and a video allegedly filmed by one of the accused, showing the tree being cut down. The defense maintains the men's innocence, with each accusing the other of being responsible for the felling.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration, which prioritize Mars missions over lunar programs, are causing concern for the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities and said ESA will assess the impact of the proposed NASA budget. The cuts could threaten major science projects and the work of researchers globally, potentially affecting international collaborations where Europe is a key partner.

          <p>Rohit Sharma, India's Test cricket captain, has retired from the longest format of the game but will continue to play ODIs and remain skipper in that format. He had been India's captain since 2022, replacing Virat Kohli, and won half of his 24 Tests as skipper. Sharma's Test career included 67 matches, 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, and 12 centuries, but his recent form had been poor, with only one fifty in 15 innings since his last Test hundred.</p>

Libya is a major transit point for asylum seekers, and human rights organizations have documented severe abuses against migrants there. This move has drawn condemnation from aid agencies and NGOs, who accuse European governments of complicity in such treatment by working with Libya to intercept migrants.</p>

          <p>Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov stated he has requested permission from Russian President Vladimir Putin to resign from his position as leader of the Chechen Republic. Kadyrov, who has previously hinted at stepping down, framed himself as a loyalist who follows Putin's command. Potential successors include Muslim Khuchiev and Apti Alaudinov. Kadyrov's leadership has been marked by an iron grip on power, secured through loyalty to Putin and suppression of separatist movements.</p>
