          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and announced it would revert to its original branding following intense customer backlash. The company had attempted a modern rebrand, changing its logo and planning restaurant remodels, which was met with widespread criticism online and even commentary from former President Trump. After listening to its customer base, the company reversed course, a decision that initially helped its stock recover some losses before the latest earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Ferguson is scheduled for sentencing after being convicted of murdering his wife, Sheryl, during a drunken argument in their home. Ferguson, 74, admitted to shooting her but claimed it was an accident, a defense the jury ultimately rejected. After the shooting, he texted his court staff admitting to the act, and prosecutors highlighted that he was a trained firearm user who understood the consequences of his actions. He faces a potential sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>A report from Bloomberg indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once designated two separate properties as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007 mortgage documents. This revelation draws parallels to the accusations of mortgage fraud that President Trump has used in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. While mortgage experts suggest neither case appears to be fraudulent, as lenders were likely aware of the circumstances, the situation highlights the political tensions surrounding the Federal Reserve's leadership and independence.</p>

          <p>Recent tax legislation, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is creating a more complex and inequitable system by introducing targeted loopholes for both the wealthy and specific working-class professions. The article argues that while extending tax cuts for corporations and high earners, the laws also create new deductions for tipped workers and those earning overtime, leaving many middle-income, salaried professionals to bear a larger relative tax burden. This shift encourages tax avoidance strategies and erodes the principle of horizontal equity, where those with similar incomes pay similar taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling to keep up with payments, particularly on high-interest credit cards. This article outlines several strategies for individuals whose debt has become unmanageable, including debt consolidation into a lower-rate loan and negotiating with creditors through a debt management plan. For more severe situations, it discusses debt settlement, which can reduce the principal balance owed, and bankruptcy as a last resort to achieve a financial reset.

          <p>A significant slowdown in the U.S. labor market, with job growth nearing zero, was a key factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates. Recent data shows hiring has slowed considerably, particularly for younger, entry-level workers, as businesses remain cautious amid policy uncertainty and the integration of AI. The Fed's rate cut is intended to support employment, but economists note that in an economy driven by supply shocks, the central bank's ability to boost the labor market may be limited.

          <p>A 29-year-old solo hiker sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries to his chest and arm after being attacked by a bear on a trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man reportedly deployed bear spray during the attack, which officials described as a "surprise encounter." The bear, believed to be a grizzly, will not be captured or killed because the attack was not considered a result of unnatural behavior, and the trail has been closed for safety as the investigation continues.</p>

Engardio is the fifth elected official in the city to be ousted in a recall vote in the past four years, highlighting ongoing political tensions and an activated electorate in San Francisco.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is advancing in Congress with the goal of providing new tools to protect seniors and other vulnerable adults from financial abuse. The legislation would allow financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme. With older Americans losing an estimated $28.3 billion annually to such crimes, the proposal aims to create stronger safeguards within the financial industry to prevent these losses.</p>
