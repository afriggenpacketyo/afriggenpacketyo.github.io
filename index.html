          <p>A study led by Peking University reveals that migratory pests from Southeast Asia, thriving under El Niño conditions, are contributing to rice yield losses in southern China. Warm, humid weather in the pest source region and wind gusts facilitate their migration.

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. This revelation further undermines the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, which had been used only three times previously, all during declared wars.</p>

          <p>President Trump is leveraging his meme coin, $TRUMP, to generate revenue and offer access to himself. The coin has generated over $320 million in fees for its creators, who make money through trading fees on a decentralized exchange. The top holders of the coin are invited to a dinner with Trump, creating an incentive to purchase the digital asset. Critics argue that the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency could allow bad actors to unduly influence the president, and Trump dismissed concerns that he was profiting from the presidency.</p>

He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results showing Riggs winning by 734 votes, but delayed the decision for seven days pending a potential appeal from Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is testing the limits of New York City campaign finance rules by seemingly using a “red-boxing” strategy on his campaign website. This involves posting strategic information that a super PAC supporting him can use to coordinate spending, circumventing rules that prohibit direct communication. Some of the points appear almost exactly in Fix the City’s most recent ad, which began airing on broadcast television on Saturday. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose public matching funds.</p>

          <p>Diana Ross made a grand entrance at the 2025 Met Gala, wearing a custom all-white ensemble with an 18-foot train. The train, designed by Ross and Ugo Mozie, featured bead detailing and embroidered names of her children and grandchildren. The theme of this year's Met Gala was "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," and the dress code was "Tailored For You." Ross, accompanied by her son Evan Ross and daughter Tracee Ellis Ross, continues to perform and has no plans to retire.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Echoes Biden in Abortion Pill Lawsuit</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the Biden administration's earlier position. This stance is surprising given President Trump's opposition to abortion rights. The request focuses on the case's venue rather than the merits, allowing the administration to avoid stating its views on mifepristone. This move may reflect a desire for political caution on abortion, particularly until the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
