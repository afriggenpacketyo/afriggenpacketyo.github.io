          <p>England's rugby league team experienced a significant 26-6 defeat against Australia at Wembley in the first Ashes match in 22 years, a performance their head coach described as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to secure a comfortable victory without reaching their full potential. Key moments, such as a breakaway run by Australia's Reece Walsh, highlighted the gap in quality between the two teams. England now faces a must-win game to prevent Australia from retaining the Ashes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated the demolition of the historic East Wing of the White House to construct a new, privately funded $300 million ballroom. The project, which Trump stated has been a dream of presidents for over 150 years, is being financed by private donors and companies. This move has drawn criticism, particularly as it involves tearing down a significant portion of the White House that traditionally houses the first lady's offices. The construction begins as Trump prepares for a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after swallowing between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he reportedly purchased online. The magnets clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, a condition where tissue dies due to prolonged pressure. Surgeons successfully removed the magnets, and the teen was discharged after an eight-day hospital stay. The incident highlights the dangers of these small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but are banned in New Zealand.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are observing a shift away from the popular "VOO and chill" investment strategy, where investors passively buy S&P 500 index ETFs. With the index now heavily concentrated in the technology sector, accounting for over 35% of its weight, many investors feel they lack proper diversification. This has led to a renewed interest in other market segments, such as small-cap stocks, which have recently outperformed the S&P 500. The trend suggests investors are actively seeking broader exposure beyond large-cap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reclusive billionaire and major Republican donor Timothy Mellon has been identified as the anonymous individual who gave $130 million to help pay U.S. troops during the ongoing government shutdown.

The donation, which equates to about $100 per service member, has raised legal questions regarding a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act, which restricts government agencies from accepting certain voluntary services or funds.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, former Vice President Kamala Harris indicated that she is considering another bid for the presidency, stating that her career in public service is "not done." While she did not make a formal announcement, she strongly suggested a future run despite current polling that places her as an underdog for the 2028 Democratic nomination. During the interview, Harris also sharply criticized former President Trump, calling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the Department of Justice for political purposes.</p>

          <p>The trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize sleep, has fueled a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like smart mattresses and sensor-laden headbands. However, the reliance on such technology has its drawbacks, as demonstrated by a recent cloud service outage that caused Eight Sleep smart beds to malfunction, trapping users in uncomfortable positions or extreme temperatures. While some sleep tech offers benefits for medical conditions, the article questions the increasing cyborg-like dependence on complex systems for a natural biological process.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created a bionic underwater drone designed to look and move like a jellyfish, earning it the nickname "underwater phantom." The small, transparent robot is made from a hydrogel material and operates with low power and near-silent propulsion, making it ideal for covert surveillance missions. Its lifelike design allows it to monitor fragile marine ecosystems or inspect underwater structures without causing disruption, showcasing advances in biomimetic robotics for intelligence and scientific purposes.</p>
