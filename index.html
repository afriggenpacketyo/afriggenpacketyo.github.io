          <p>A senior White House official stated that President Trump is not interested in speaking with Elon Musk to resolve their ongoing dispute. The feud between the two billionaires escalated following Musk's criticism of Trump's proposed tax bill. Trump accused Musk of being "crazy" and threatened to cancel federal contracts with his companies, while Musk claimed Trump couldn't have been elected without his financial support and accused him of ingratitude. The article notes the back and forth of Musk threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft and then walking back his statement. This follows Musk's prior advisory role in the administration.</p>
