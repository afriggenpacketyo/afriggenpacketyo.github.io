          <p>A judge dismissed charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, who was accused by the attorney general and FBI director of being a regional leader of the MS-13 gang, paving the way for his expedited deportation. The Justice Department requested the dismissal, but Villatoro Santos's attorney questioned the lack of explanation for withdrawing the charges and accused the DOJ of bypassing due-process protections. The attorney argued that the Justice Department was attempting to deport him without due process, criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security. Villatoro Santos was facing a federal felony gun possession charge, with only a fleeting reference to MS-13 in the charging documents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas issued a permanent injunction against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals, asserting that the administration's claims did not constitute an "invasion." The judge's decision contested the White House's attempt to apply the 18th-century law to modern immigration policy, emphasizing that the act was intended for times of declared war or military invasion. This ruling could influence other cases challenging the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, although it is limited to the Southern District of Texas. The judge determined that the activities of the Tren de Aragua gang did not align with the act's definitions of invasion or predatory incursion.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has discontinued $1 billion in funding for mental health services in schools, citing concerns that the programs violated federal civil rights law by focusing on increasing the diversity of mental health workers. Lawmakers had authorized the funding in 2022 following a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, as part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Education Department claimed that grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions, such as recruiting quotas, which the department viewed as discriminatory.

Kennedy also announced a new initiative for the National Institutes of Health to accelerate the development of new inoculations for COVID, bird flu, and seasonal flu using methods other than mRNA technology.

          <p>Former Carolina Panthers wide receiver Steve Smith is facing a civil lawsuit alleging an affair with a member of the Baltimore Ravens marching band. The husband of the woman involved is suing Smith for over $100,000 under North Carolina's "alienation of affection" law, which allows a spouse to sue a third party for destroying a marriage. The lawsuit claims that Smith and the woman exchanged sexual text messages and met in his hotel room, with Smith allegedly responding with repeated apologies when confronted about the affair. To prove the lawsuit, the husband must demonstrate genuine love in the relationship prior to Smith's alleged involvement.</p>

          <p>A minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine could lead to significant investments in Ukraine's reconstruction, but the extraction of resources and subsequent profits may take years to materialize. The nine-page deal, the text of which was released by Ukraine's government, establishes a joint investment fund managed by Kyiv and Washington, with revenues from new projects in critical minerals, oil, and gas. While the agreement ties President Trump to Ukraine's future, it notably omits any security guarantees that Ukraine had sought. Critics express concerns about the lack of specifics and potential for unfair benefits to U.S. investors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been back in the White House for just over 100 days, and he's already contemplating a third term, which would have been considered absurd for much of American history. The two-term presidential limit was merely a custom until the ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment in 1951. Despite the constitutional barrier, Trump's allies have explored ways around the amendment, such as running for vice president and then assuming the presidency. The decision of whether two terms of Trump are enough would ultimately fall to voters, but history suggests the public may not automatically uphold long-established limits.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Colorado Springs, Yemi Mobolade, is facing criticism from liberal voters after a federal immigration raid at a local nightclub resulted in over 100 arrests. The raid, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, targeted a club allegedly rife with drugs, guns, and prostitution, but sparked concerns about the treatment of immigrants in the city. While Mobolade defended the operation, stating that those committing crimes should face consequences, some voters felt betrayed and questioned the city's cooperation with federal agents. The incident highlights the challenges mayors face in balancing anti-Trump constituents with federal pressure for police cooperation.</p>

          <p>The federal health department released a report advocating for therapy instead of medical interventions for youth diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The report claims that while evidence for harms associated with medical treatments is sparse, medical care should be avoided in favor of therapy. This contradicts the guidance of major medical associations, which urge state governments to stop interfering in the healthcare of transgender children. The report stems from an executive order calling for a review of evidence by the health department, reflecting the administration's hostility toward the LGBTQ+ community and transgender people in particular.</p>

McDonald's experienced a 3.6% fall in U.S. sales due to cautious consumer spending amid economic uncertainty, while GM cut its profit guidance, estimating that tariffs could cost the company up to $5 billion in 2025. The uncertainty and frequent changes to tariff policy have disrupted supply chains and markets, affecting consumer sentiment and leading to cutbacks in dining out. The US economy also experienced a contraction in the first quarter, with consumer sentiment plummeting after the announcement of Trump's tariffs.</p>

However, analysts caution that this surge in demand may not last, as new vehicle inventories tighten and prices increase.

The increases vary by region, with the Xbox Series S seeing a price increase of £50 in the UK and €80 in Europe. In the US, the Series X will cost between $100 and $130 more. This move contrasts with the industry's historical trend of price reductions following a console's launch. Experts predict that the tariff disruptions are a catalyst for the increase.</p>
