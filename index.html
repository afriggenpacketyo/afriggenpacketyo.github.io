        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shaquille O'Neal voiced strong criticism of the current NBA, asserting that many players are not performing at a high level. O'Neal specifically called out Ben Simmons, stating that he should be "arrested" for earning a substantial salary without producing commensurate results on the court. He contrasted Simmons' performance with that of Jayson Tatum, whom he acknowledged as a capable player. The Hall of Famer's comments reflect a broader sentiment that the NBA has seen a decline in the quality of play, with some stars not fully participating in the regular season. This has led to concerns about ratings and overall fan engagement. (not investment advice)</p>

Maintaining these relationships can also signal to others that we are capable of sustaining deep connections over time, a quality that most people value. The article draws a parallel to the dynamic between childhood friends depicted in the TV show "The White Lotus," where characters grapple with maintaining bonds despite diverging paths and values.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges due to a lack of resources and coordination within the federal government. The policy, which includes a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all imports and higher rates on countries with large trade deficits, could lead to bureaucratic bottlenecks and uncertainty for businesses. The article highlights concerns about Customs and Border Protection's capacity to handle the increased workload and the potential for revenue projections to fall short. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vietnam has requested a delay in the implementation of President Trump's newly announced tariffs while the two sides negotiate, signaling an early test of Trump's willingness to haggle over his protectionist trade agenda. Vietnamese Communist Party chief To Lam contacted Trump, and Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son met with the U.S. Ambassador, requesting a postponement. Vietnam, hit with a 46% tariff rate, is seeking a one to three month delay to reach an agreement that benefits both countries. The U.S. is Vietnam's biggest export market.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and flash flooding across the central US have resulted in at least 16 deaths, including a 9-year-old boy in Kentucky who was swept away by floodwaters. Forecasters at the National Weather Service warned of "potentially historic" rainfall and wide temperature swings from the central US to the East Coast. Several states have declared states of emergency, and hundreds of thousands are without power. The region has been hit by a series of extreme weather events, including tornadoes, wildfires, and dust storms, in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's new tariffs, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones declared that the era of globalization has "ended." This comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hinted at state intervention to protect UK firms from the US president's actions. The UK was hit with a 10% "baseline" import duty, and negotiations for a trade deal to reduce tariffs are ongoing. Jones emphasized the need for the UK to invest in its domestic economy and build relationships with allies around the world.</p>

          <p>The Wallis Annenberg wildlife crossing, the largest of its kind in the world, is under construction in Los Angeles, aiming to connect two parts of the Santa Monica mountain range. The project seeks to protect wildlife from being crushed by cars on the 101 freeway, one of the busiest roadways in the nation. The crossing will feature native plants, vegetated sound walls, and engineered soil to seamlessly integrate into the environment. The project is a public-private partnership with a goal of completion by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration ramps up deportations, immigrants with pending cases are increasingly fearful of routine check-ins with ICE, which have become more fraught. Previously, these check-ins were typically uneventful, but now, many immigrants are being arrested and detained. ICE does not track the number of arrests made at check-ins, but the Guardian estimates that about 8% of arrests in the administration’s first month occurred during or after these meetings. Lawyers are advising clients to prepare for potential detention and to bring support to their appointments.</p>

The arrest highlights the increased risk faced by immigrants, even those complying with ICE regulations, under the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, faces the death penalty after Attorney General Pam Bondi's announcement. Mangione maintains his innocence, but the case has taken on cultural significance due to widespread loathing for the for-profit healthcare industry. Veteran defense attorneys suggest that Mangione's legal team may focus on mitigating circumstances and fighting the death penalty rather than emphasizing guilt or innocence. The decision to seek the death penalty could influence the jury's perception and the overall legal strategy.</p>

          <p>More than half of millennials are engaging in "polyworking," holding multiple jobs to cope with inflation and wage stagnation, according to a new study. The trend is driven by the need to add to savings, pursue personal interests, and gain skills for career advancement. While some critics express concerns about the impact on work-life balance, others view polyworking as a form of entrepreneurship that provides financial security and personal fulfillment. This new reality reflects a shift in the workplace, where traditional employment models are evolving to meet the economic challenges faced by many workers.</p>
