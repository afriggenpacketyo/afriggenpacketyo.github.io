          <p>North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong vetoed a bill that would have restricted access to sexually explicit materials in libraries.  The governor cited concerns about overreach and censorship.  The bill would have imposed restrictions on librarians and potentially led to prosecution for non-compliance.  The veto reflects a stance against government regulation of library materials and the potential for limiting access to information.</p>
