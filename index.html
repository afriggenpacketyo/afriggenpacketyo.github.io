          <p>Russia conducted its most extensive drone and missile attack on Ukraine to date, launching over 800 munitions. The assault resulted in at least eight civilian deaths nationwide, with two fatalities reported in Kyiv. Notably, Ukraine's main cabinet building in the capital sustained damage to its roof and upper floors, marking a significant escalation in targeting. President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate crime aimed at prolonging the war and called for increased international military assistance and sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Four senior physicians who recently resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly voiced their concerns over the direction of U.S. public health policy. They cite the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as threatening the nation's health infrastructure. The doctors argue that the new guidelines for children and pregnant women lack a basis in scientific evidence and could lead to preventable outbreaks of diseases like measles. Their departure highlights a growing rift between the scientific community and the current administration's health agency.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has officially started her one-year term as the President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, due to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. Baerbock's nomination by the previous German government faced some domestic criticism, including from the new Chancellor Friedrich Merz. In her new role, she will chair meetings and help prepare for the election of the next UN Secretary-General, pledging to act as a unifier for all 193 member states.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult decision to accept her nomination to the high court. She describes the significant personal sacrifices required, including uprooting her family from their life in South Bend, Indiana, and the loss of privacy that came with intense public scrutiny. Barrett shares an anecdote about escaping media crews by scaling a fence in high heels after a church service. She reveals that she and her husband agreed to "burn the boats," committing fully to the new path without looking back.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett responded to criticisms regarding the court's recent decisions and perceived political leanings. She pushed back against labels of the court shifting "to the right," stating she decides cases as they come and has been criticized by both sides. Barrett addressed her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, explaining the Dobbs decision returns the issue of abortion to the democratic process in the states. When questioned about the court's handling of cases involving President Trump's executive power, she asserted that the court's role is to decide legal questions, not to form political views on his actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's recent elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has sparked concern for small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic may be misdirected, as the majority of the 33 million small businesses in the U.S. are service-based and do not import goods directly. While acknowledging that prices will rise, the author contends that the economy can likely absorb the impact as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong. The article suggests businesses can adapt by diversifying suppliers, targeting price increases, and offering financing options to customers. (not investment advice)</p>

Shoemaker cultivated the kayak by growing a network of wild Ganoderma polychromum mycelium on a hemp substrate inside a fiberglass mold.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have reported that 890 people were arrested during a demonstration in London protesting the UK government's decision to proscribe the group Palestine Action. The majority of arrests were for supporting a banned organization under the Terrorism Act, with 17 arrests for assaults on police officers. The protest, which drew an estimated 1,500 people to Parliament Square, turned violent according to police, a claim disputed by organizers who stated they were "peacefully defying the ban."

          <p>Over 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. The protests, some of the largest in recent months, reflect growing public pressure to prioritize the return of the hostages, as many as 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. Family members of those held captive delivered emotional speeches, warning that an expansion of the war in Gaza would further endanger their loved ones. The demonstrations occurred as the Israeli government signals preparations to intensify its military offensive.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina football team with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed reports about his relationship with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC practices. Belichick stated that since he feels he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, signaling a clear deterioration of the relationship. The win provided a much-needed boost for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss.</p>

          <p>London's transport system is experiencing significant disruption as a five-day strike by London Underground staff begins. Members of the RMT union are taking rolling action, demanding a pay increase and a reduced 32-hour work week to address "fatigue management." Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter work week as unaffordable and impractical. The strike will result in little to no service on most Tube lines through Thursday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground expected to be much busier than usual.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a world leader in green-tech exports, China is also ramping up its coal power capacity. This article argues that this is not a climate policy reversal but a pragmatic strategy to ensure grid stability. As China adds record amounts of solar and wind power, the existing grid struggles with intermittency and "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal-fired plants are being used as a reliable backup power source to prevent blackouts during peak demand, giving operators the confidence to continue the rapid expansion of clean energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for instructing its broadcast partners to refrain from showing any crowd disruptions or negative reactions when President Donald Trump appears on screen at the US Open final. Critics are calling the move cowardly and hypocritical, noting the tournament often televises other disruptions, such as climate protests. The decision is seen as an attempt to shield a political figure from public disapproval, which this article argues is contrary to the democratic expression often seen at sporting events. This censorship is viewed as stripping the tournament of its characteristically unfiltered atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for second-hand clothing, was founded in Lithuania in 2008 out of a simple necessity. Co-founder Milda Mitkutė needed to downsize her wardrobe of 300 items after moving to a smaller apartment. She discussed the idea of a website to sell her unwanted clothes with a friend, Justas Janauskas, and within two weeks, they had launched a basic site. The platform, which allows users to sell items without a commission fee, grew through word-of-mouth and expanded internationally. In 2019, Vinted became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup, valued at over a billion dollars.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued a statement encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, following a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious readings. His specific endorsement of a Christian prayer is drawing criticism, especially in light of his past actions. In 2017, Paxton's office formally questioned a school district for allowing Muslim students to use a classroom for prayer, raising concerns about exclusivity. Critics argue this demonstrates a Christian nationalist agenda that violates the constitutional separation of church and state by favoring one religion over others.</p>

          <p>A group of women who were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell gathered at the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The bipartisan bill would compel the release of all government files on Epstein, regardless of who might be embarrassed. Survivors expressed frustration with the slow pace of the House Oversight Committee's investigation and President Trump's dismissal of the issue as a "Democrat hoax." One survivor stated that if the government fails to act, the survivors are discussing creating and releasing their own list of individuals involved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's second-term economic strategy increasingly resembles the state-controlled Peronism of mid-20th century Argentina. The article points to policies like high tariffs to promote domestic production, direct presidential intervention in corporate deals, and the use of "emergency" powers to bypass normal processes. Examples include forcing golden shares in corporate acquisitions and taking government stakes in tech companies like Intel. The author warns that this centralization of economic power based on personal connections rather than consistent rules risks entrenching cronyism and moving the U.S. away from market capitalism.

          <p>Despite massive investment and soaring stock valuations for tech companies, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence is not yet delivering significant productivity boosts in the real world. A recent study found experienced software developers were actually slower when using AI tools, highlighting a "capability-reliability gap." With tech giants spending hundreds of billions on AI infrastructure with little return so far, there is a growing concern that the market is in an AI bubble. A potential crash could be more severe than the dot-com bust, as AI-related spending is currently acting as a major stimulus for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>
