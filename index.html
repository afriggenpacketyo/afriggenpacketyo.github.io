        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The percentage of car trade-ins with negative equity has surged to a four-year high of 26.6% in the second quarter of 2025, meaning many drivers owe more than their vehicles are worth. This financial burden, averaging $6,754 per loan, complicates new car purchases as consumers must either pay the balance or roll it into a new loan. Experts recommend holding onto current vehicles, securing pre-approved, lower-interest loans, and considering guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance, especially with the rise of 84-month loan terms. The article highlights how factors like long loan terms and small down payments contribute to this widespread "underwater" phenomenon (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article offers a detailed roundup of several NFL Week 2 games, highlighting key results and standout player performances across the league. The Dallas Cowboys secured a dramatic overtime victory against the New York Giants, extending their impressive winning streak over their NFC East rivals. The Cincinnati Bengals also clinched a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, though the triumph was overshadowed by a concerning toe injury sustained by star quarterback Joe Burrow. Other notable outcomes included the Seattle Seahawks' opportunistic win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions' dominant rebound against the Chicago Bears, and the New England Patriots' upset victory against the Miami Dolphins, showcasing rookie Drake Maye's potential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This NPR article, referencing the "Sea Change" podcast, examines how communities in Louisiana and Alaska are confronting and adapting to severe climate-driven coastal erosion. Both regions face unique yet equally urgent challenges from rising sea levels and extreme weather, leading to significant land loss and threatening traditional ways of life. The article explores the diverse strategies and difficult decisions these vulnerable populations are making to protect their homes, infrastructure, and cultural heritage. It highlights the profound, ongoing environmental shifts and the innovative, often collaborative, efforts to build resilience against these forces.</p>

          <h2>BBC Investigation Links Afghan Maternal Deaths to US Aid Cuts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation uncovers a tragic rise in maternal and newborn deaths across Afghanistan, directly correlating with the closure of over 400 medical facilities following the Trump administration's drastic cuts to US aid. The article features distressing personal stories, such as a woman who died in childbirth by the roadside because her local USAID-supported clinic was no longer operational. Despite US assertions to the contrary, the BBC documented numerous such fatalities, underscoring the severe humanitarian impact on the impoverished nation. Compounding the crisis, the Taliban's stringent restrictions on women's education, including for midwives, further cripple healthcare access.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old, Ryder Corral, was arrested in Phoenix for vandalizing a growing memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk outside the Turning Point USA headquarters. Corral was filmed kicking over flowers, vases, and flags before being apprehended by a mourner. Phoenix police charged him with criminal damage and disorderly conduct. The article highlights that Corral's shirt bore a resemblance to that allegedly worn by Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Kirk's assassination, though it clarifies this is an observation and not a direct connection to the murder investigation. This incident underscores the heightened tensions following Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Astronauts returning from spacewalks consistently report distinct smells, often metallic or acrid, reminiscent of burnt steak or gunpowder, which scientists hypothesize results from atomic oxygen reacting with spacesuit materials. Beyond Earth's orbit, astrochemistry provides valuable insights into the potential aromas of celestial bodies, offering clues about their chemical composition and formation. For example, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is theorized to smell of rotten eggs and formaldehyde, while Mars might subtly hint at sulfur. Saturn's moon Titan is believed to have a petroleum-like scent due to its rich hydrocarbon composition, demonstrating how these "smells" are windows into planetary science and the history of our solar system.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has accused the United States of "illegally and hostilely" detaining one of its fishing boats for eight hours in Venezuela's exclusive economic zone. The incident involved the USS Jason Dunham, a US destroyer, and a vessel carrying nine tuna fishermen, which Caracas deemed a "direct provocation." Venezuela's foreign ministry suggested the US is seeking an incident to escalate conflict and justify "regime change," demanding an immediate halt to such actions. This accusation comes amid heightened tensions between the two nations, particularly after the US deployed warships to the Caribbean to target drug cartels and increased a bounty for President Maduro's capture.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson asserted that the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk could serve as a critical "turning point" for the United States, urging national leaders to "turn down the rhetoric." Johnson condemned the use of inflammatory labels like "Nazis and fascists," cautioning that such language can incite violence among "deranged people."

The Speaker detailed congressional efforts to honor Kirk and enhance security for public officials, advocating for calm and truth amidst the nation's divisive political climate.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has announced the termination of its discussions with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com concerning the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The decision came after JD.com communicated a demand for "materially revised" terms and commitments, which Sainsbury's concluded were not in the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the collapse of these high-profile negotiations, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, expecting to achieve a retail underlying operating profit of approximately £1 billion in the financial year 2025-2026. This development marks a significant turn for the UK retail sector.</p>

His investment philosophy matured after reading Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" and experiencing a severe injury in 2020, which underscored the need for financial security beyond his playing career.

She cautioned that internal strife would only empower Nigel Farage and Reform UK, leading to wider losses. Phillipson aims to amplify members' voices at the Cabinet table, with this contest also viewed as a gauge of the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations.</p>

          <p>UCLA has dismissed head football coach DeShaun Foster after a winless 0-3 start to the season, concluding his tenure with a 5-10 record over just more than one full season. This abrupt decision underscores the university's intolerance for the team's poor performance, particularly following back-to-back losses against Mountain West Conference opponents. Tim Skipper will assume the role of interim coach as UCLA commences a national search for a permanent replacement. Foster, a former star player for the Bruins, is owed approximately $6.43 million in buyout money, and his firing has already resulted in the de-commitment of three high school recruits, signaling immediate repercussions for the program.</p>
