          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, a decision the network described as purely financial. Stephen Colbert, who has hosted since 2015, informed his audience during a taping, expressing gratitude to the network, his staff, and viewers. Despite being the top-rated late-night show for nine consecutive seasons, the network will retire "The Late Show" franchise entirely, citing a challenging economic environment for late-night television. CBS praised Colbert's contributions and plans to celebrate the show's final 10 months.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company Neuralink identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing with the Small Business Administration (SBA). This designation is intended for companies owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to gain preferential access to federal contracts. The filing occurred shortly before a financing round valued Neuralink at $9 billion and while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative. The Department of Justice has previously fined companies for making false claims about their status as a small disadvantaged business.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted five individuals in Louisiana, including three current and former police chiefs, for an alleged visa fraud conspiracy. The defendants are accused of creating falsified police reports that depicted immigrants as victims of fabricated crimes. These fraudulent reports were then used to help the immigrants apply for U-visas, which are reserved for crime victims who assist law enforcement. The scheme allegedly involved payments of thousands of dollars for each bogus report, undermining the integrity of both law enforcement and the immigration system.</p>

          <p>The animal rights organization PETA has expressed support for a bipartisan legislative effort to stop the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from funding animal experiments conducted in foreign countries. Spearheaded by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, the CARGO Act aims to address concerns over a lack of oversight and inhumane conditions in overseas research facilities. The letter to the NIH director highlighted that over $2.2 billion in grants were issued for such research between 2011 and 2021. PETA cited its own investigation into a Colombian lab as a key reason for the bill, emphasizing the need for responsible use of taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The cooling inflation is partly attributed to an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the headline inflation rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, analysts are divided on whether it will lead to an imminent interest rate hike. The economic data comes as Japan faces growth concerns related to potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition. The diagnosis came after the president experienced swelling in his legs, prompting a comprehensive medical examination. His physician stated the condition is "benign and common" in people over 70 and confirmed that tests showed no signs of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or heart failure. The announcement also addressed recent photos of bruising on Trump's hand, attributing it to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This political analysis explains that the Labour Party's decision to suspend MP Diane Abbott for a second time was largely unavoidable to maintain consistency. The suspension stems from a recent interview where Abbott stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension, in which she appeared to downplay antisemitism. Although her language has since shifted, her lack of regret for the original remarks put the party leadership in a difficult position. For leader Keir Starmer, who has prioritized eradicating antisemitism from the party, taking decisive action was seen as essential to uphold his stated commitments.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the United States have climbed to record levels, with the average cost of ground beef reaching $6.12 per pound in June. This surge is driven by a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding. Additional pressures from a pest outbreak in Mexico and the potential impact of tariffs on imported beef suggest that consumers should not expect significant price relief soon.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant departure from previous policy, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is recommending a single-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment complex during the fatal 2020 raid. The sentencing memo requests credit for time served, meaning Hankison would serve no additional jail time, and also calls for three years of supervised release. This recommendation is seen by critics as a reversal of efforts toward police accountability that followed widespread protests in 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the White House announcement of President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). CVI is a common circulatory condition, particularly in adults over 70, where damaged veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing swelling and varicose veins. While generally not a serious threat, it can be painful and lead to complications like skin ulcers if left untreated. According to medical experts, treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise and leg elevation, compression stockings, and in some cases, minimally invasive procedures to close off problematic veins.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a key FEMA program for pre-disaster mitigation. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision the states contend is Congress's purview. The BRIC program funded local projects to protect against natural disasters, and its cancellation threatens hundreds of planned initiatives. The states are seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the reallocation of the program's funds while the case proceeds.</p>

While Long Beach has seen three previous independent league teams fail over the past 30 years, proponents believe the city's strong baseball tradition and the stability of the Pioneer League create a new opportunity for success.</p>

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld the state's congressional map, a decision that critics argue weakens the voting power of Black residents. The legal challenge centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's move to dismantle a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice. The court's majority opinion, written by a DeSantis appointee, concluded that recreating a similar district would improperly prioritize race over other redistricting criteria. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Jorge Labarga warned that the ruling could render the state's anti-gerrymandering protections ineffective.</p>

          <p>Legal analysts are expressing concern over the Supreme Court's increasing use of its emergency "shadow docket," which has frequently resulted in favorable outcomes for the Trump administration without full legal arguments or explanations. In recent months, the Court has issued numerous emergency rulings allowing controversial policies, such as dismantling the Department of Education and deporting noncitizens to third countries, to proceed while litigation continues in lower courts. This trend allows the administration to implement policies before their legality is fully determined, raising questions about the Court's transparency and potential politicization.</p>

Some experts believe that addressing the crisis could help ease tensions between the two economic powers, while others are more optimistic it could lead to a renewal of the 2020 trade deal that temporarily halted escalations.
