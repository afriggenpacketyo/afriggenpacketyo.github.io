          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou is facing mounting pressure after failing to secure a win in his first seven games, leaving the club just one point above the relegation zone. Following a 2-0 defeat to Newcastle United, Postecoglou acknowledged that he expects to discuss the team's poor performance and future direction with the club's owner. Despite criticism from fans and a vulnerable defensive record, he remains defiant, stating he loves a challenge and is confident in his ability to turn the situation around. The upcoming international break is seen as a critical period for him to implement his strategic changes with the team.</p>

          <p>School counselors in California are observing significant mental health distress, including acute anxiety and fear, among students following a summer of intensified immigration enforcement actions. In communities like Oxnard, children of undocumented or mixed-status parents express constant worry about family separation, which experts say can lead to long-term psychological issues. Schools are becoming crucial support centers, offering counseling and stability, but face challenges as families may hesitate to seek help due to fear. The situation highlights the profound emotional toll that immigration policies have on children's well-being and their ability to focus on their education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to protect federal property amidst ongoing protests related to immigration enforcement. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from state and local leaders, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who accused the administration of manufacturing a crisis. The deployment follows a tense incident where federal agents shot an armed woman after they were reportedly rammed by vehicles. This action is part of a broader, controversial strategy of sending federal forces into Democrat-led cities, raising legal and constitutional questions about the use of military personnel for domestic matters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has identified the immediate release of all hostages from Gaza as the most urgent phase of the new peace plan proposed by the Trump administration. He stated that upcoming talks in Cairo should focus on the logistics of the release, which must happen quickly and without delay. The U.S.-backed proposal involves Hamas freeing all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, followed by a phased Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. Rubio emphasized that a halt to bombardments is necessary for a safe hostage exchange, framing the plan as a viable framework for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic leaders are engaged in a public dispute over responsibility for the ongoing federal government shutdown, which has now entered its fifth day. Johnson accuses Democrats of not negotiating seriously, while Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries asserts that Republicans are spreading misinformation about Democratic positions on healthcare. With formal talks stalled for nearly a week, both parties appear to be positioning themselves for political advantage ahead of future discussions. The White House has also raised the possibility of mass layoffs of federal workers if the stalemate continues, escalating the pressure on all sides.</p>

          <p>Sussex Police have released images of two individuals they want to identify in connection with a suspected arson attack at a mosque in Peacehaven, East Sussex. The incident, which is being investigated as a hate crime, caused damage to the building's entrance and a vehicle but resulted in no injuries. According to a volunteer, two people inside the mosque managed to escape after attackers set fire to a liquid poured at the locked front door. The attack has been condemned by community leaders and the Home Secretary, who called for unity against such hateful acts, highlighting a renewed focus on security at places of worship.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing questions over his decision to keep the House out of session during the government shutdown, which prevents the swearing-in of a newly-elected Democratic congresswoman. During an interview, NBC's Kristen Welker pressed Johnson on accusations that the delay is a political maneuver to prevent a crucial vote on releasing Department of Justice files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The new member, Adelita Grijalva, is believed to provide the 218th vote needed to pass the measure. Johnson dismissed the charge as "totally absurd" and a "red herring," insisting the shutdown is the sole reason for the House's inactivity.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7th attack, Israel has only partially achieved its stated war aims of recovering all hostages and destroying Hamas, according to a comprehensive review of the conflict. While Israeli military actions have weakened Hamas, Hezbollah, and other regional adversaries, they have come at a staggering cost, with tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties and widespread destruction in Gaza. The conflict has led to international accusations of genocide, arrest warrants for Israeli leaders from the ICC, and a growing number of countries recognizing Palestinian statehood. The war has also deeply fragmented Israeli society, with widespread protests calling for a ceasefire.</p>

Despite public awareness campaigns and increased police patrols with drones, advocates argue that fundamental safety measures, like locking doors between subway cars, are needed to physically prevent access to train roofs.

The woman, Marimar Martinez, and another man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, now face federal charges for assaulting an officer.

The heavy snowfall, which began Friday evening, has blocked access to the area on the mountain's eastern side, which sits above 16,000 feet. Chinese state media reports that some individuals were suffering from hypothermia after their tents collapsed under the weight of the snow. Hundreds of local villagers and rescue personnel have been deployed to clear the blocked routes, and some tourists have already been successfully evacuated from the hazardous conditions.</p>

However, the prolonged absence of key economic data from government agencies, such as the jobs report, could create uncertainty for future Federal Reserve policy decisions.

          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. He explains that nonverbal cues like a sigh or a sharp edge in one's voice can make a simple question feel like an accusation, carrying more emotional weight than the words themselves. To mitigate this, Travers advises individuals to become self-aware, pause, and rephrase their statements if they notice their tone is harsh. He also suggests that the person on the receiving end should calmly ask their partner to try again, interrupting the cycle of escalation without becoming defensive.</p>

          <p>Democrats are employing the high-risk strategy of a government shutdown as their most significant effort to challenge the Trump administration's actions, which many view as a threat to democratic norms. Progressive activists, who are coordinating with party leadership, frame the standoff not just as a policy dispute over healthcare but as a necessary battle to prevent the executive branch from seizing congressional spending power. While Republicans accuse them of sabotage, Democrats feel the shutdown is their only leverage to force concessions, particularly on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Early polling suggests the public is more inclined to blame Republicans for the shutdown.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests HPV Herd Immunity is Achievable in the U.S. with High Vaccination Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, thanks to a successful and gender-neutral adolescent vaccination program. Research published in JAMA Pediatrics found that high vaccination rates have led to a significant decline in HPV infections, even among unvaccinated women, demonstrating community-wide protection. Experts emphasize that maintaining this herd immunity is dynamic and depends on sustaining high vaccine uptake. The findings highlight the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in preventing cancer and support global efforts by the WHO to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will grant police new powers to impose conditions on repeated protests, allowing them to consider the cumulative impact on communities. This could enable police to direct organizers to different locations if a site has been subject to frequent demonstrations. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the move is about placing restrictions, not banning protests, to balance free expression with public safety, particularly for communities feeling intimidated. The announcement follows the arrest of nearly 500 protesters at a recent demonstration and has been criticized by civil liberties groups as a further crackdown on the right to peaceful assembly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has become a dominant force in social media political advertising, outspending entire countries' political establishments. This strategy is now challenged by new ad bans from platforms like Facebook and Google, which could disrupt a key pillar of Fidesz's communication. In response, Orban has launched an initiative to recruit online activists, or "digital freedom fighters," to spread the party's message organically. This pivot to grassroots-style online campaigning comes as Fidesz faces a growing challenge from opposition figure Peter Magyar, whose social media presence has a strong organic reach without paid advertising.</p>

          <p>A cluster of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino County overnight from Saturday into Sunday morning. The series of temblors was centered in the San Bernardino Mountains, approximately four miles north of the Big Bear Airport. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the shaking was felt as "weak" in the immediate area, with vibrations comparable to a passing truck. While minor, the event recalls the area's history with seismic activity, including the significant magnitude 6.3 Big Bear and magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquakes in 1992.</p>

          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown asserts that effective communication requires a "tolerance for discomfort" because it involves vulnerability and honesty. In a recent interview, she explained that people often struggle with communication because they are not taught how to be clear, use precise language, or take accountability for their words. Brown highlights that tone is often lost in text messages, advocating for more direct conversations. Experts suggest using phrases that validate the other person's feelings, such as "It sounds like what's most important to you is..." to navigate conflicts constructively and demonstrate that you are actively listening and empathetic.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Oregon, police faced a major setback when a crucial piece of evidence was destroyed. A maroon minivan, believed to be the primary crime scene, was towed and sold to a scrapyard just days after the murder. By the time Detective Devin Rigo located the vehicle, it had already been crushed into scrap metal, eliminating any potential forensic evidence inside. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, who allegedly had a history of stalking the victim, was arrested and charged with the murder based on other evidence, including security footage.</p>

          <p>Tech and real estate giants including Amazon, Meta, and Prologis have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. Concrete production is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the alliance aims to use its collective purchasing power to create demand for more sustainable alternatives. By providing financial incentives and off-take agreements, the group hopes to encourage producers to invest in expensive decarbonization technologies. The initiative will also use a "book-and-claim" system, similar to the renewable energy market, to overcome geographical barriers in the complex concrete supply chain.</p>
