          <p>A Georgia woman, Melody Farris, was convicted of murdering her husband, Gary Farris, after his remains were found on their property. The investigation revealed a complex family dynamic, including an affair Melody was having and financial tensions. During her sentencing, Melody shocked the court by accusing her son, Scott, of the murder, claiming he wanted control of the family farm, but the police have already ruled him out as a suspect. Scott vehemently denies the accusations, maintaining that Melody is responsible for his father's death. The case has deeply divided the Farris family.</p>
