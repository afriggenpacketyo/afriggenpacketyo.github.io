          <p>At least 42 Palestinians were killed overnight and into Saturday from Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, including a dozen people waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have reportedly stalled, with both the U.S. and Israeli delegations being recalled. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with the United Nations and other experts warning that Palestinians are facing the risk of famine due to ongoing conflict and aid restrictions. The incident marks another deadly event at an aid distribution point in the war-torn enclave.</p>

          <p>Deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have entered a third day, resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people. The fighting, which involves artillery and gunfire, expanded after a landmine incident injured Thai soldiers. Both nations have traded accusations and recalled their ambassadors, while international bodies like the U.N. Security Council and ASEAN are urging de-escalation. U.S. President Trump announced that he spoke with both leaders and they agreed to meet to work towards an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in the Norwich area, with an estimated 350-400 anti-immigration protesters and about 150 counter-protesters present. The event, marked by a heavy police presence, was described as noisy but largely peaceful, with no arrests made. Anti-immigration protesters chanted slogans like "Stop the invasion," while organizers insisted their demonstration was a peaceful community action and not racist. The protest reflects growing tensions across the UK regarding the government's policy of housing asylum seekers in hotels.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music is causing a major debate within the music industry, exemplified by synthetic acts like The Velvet Sundown, which has over a million monthly listeners on Spotify. While some see AI as a new frontier for creativity, many artists and major record labels view it as a threat to human expression and intellectual property. Major labels have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms for alleged copyright infringement in their training data. The development has left many human musicians feeling frustrated as they compete with AI that can produce songs on a massive scale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC analysis argues that Israel's offer to allow airdrops of aid into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. The article contends that airdrops are a crude, inefficient, and potentially dangerous method of delivery, often resulting in very little aid reaching those most in need. Drawing on past examples from conflicts in Iraq and Bosnia, the author emphasizes that only a ceasefire and unrestricted, long-term ground access for aid convoys can effectively address the looming famine. The piece is critical of what it portrays as a gesture that looks good but has minimal practical impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by researchers at the University of Notre Dame has found per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in a significant portion of reusable period products. Nearly a third of the tested items, including period underwear and menstrual cups, contained the toxic chemicals, which have been linked to cancer and other health issues. Researchers noted that since some products tested were PFAS-free, their use is not essential for manufacturing, and they hope the findings will raise consumer and industry awareness.</p>

Despite being older than most transplant patients, he was deemed a good candidate and, after a month in the hospital, received the life-saving surgery, which has restored his lung capacity to 98%.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's directive to release grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, legal experts are cautioning that the files may not provide the explosive revelations many expect. Veteran attorneys suggest that grand jury transcripts often contain procedural information and testimony from law enforcement, rather than a comprehensive list of co-conspirators. They argue that more significant and salacious details about Epstein's crimes and associates are likely held in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memoranda.</p>
