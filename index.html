          <p>In Nederland, Colorado, the Carousel of Happiness stands as a testament to a vision that sustained a Marine during the Vietnam War. While under fire, Corporal Scott Harrison found solace in an image of a carousel in a mountain meadow. Years later, he brought that vision to life by restoring a broken-down carousel, which now operates as a non-profit dedicated to spreading joy. The hand-carved animals and whimsical music offer a place of delight and healing, a mission born from one of the darkest of places, demonstrating the power of hope.</p>

          <p>A little-known landmark in Washington, D.C., the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum, commemorates a revolutionary post-Civil War effort. After the war, Clara Barton established an office in this building to locate thousands of missing or deceased Union soldiers, a pioneering initiative that forever changed the military's approach to accounting for its members. The museum preserves the site where Barton and her team worked tirelessly to provide answers and closure to countless families across the nation. Her work laid the groundwork for the American Red Cross, which she would later found.</p>

          <p>Growing volcanic activity is being observed near Naples, Italy, particularly at Campi Flegrei, a massive caldera located just west of Mount Vesuvius. This supervolcano lies beneath urban areas where half a million people reside, raising significant safety concerns. In February alone, the area experienced around two thousand earthquakes, prompting close monitoring by scientists from Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. The situation highlights the precarious existence of communities living within this active volcanic "red zone."</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the most vital skill to teach a child is "self-connection." This involves the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Instead, parents are encouraged to validate emotions and provide space for their children to develop a strong sense of self.</p>

The outcome reflects widespread public frustration over rising prices, a string of political scandals, and challenging trade negotiations with the United States.

Writer Olga Khazan, who documented her own journey in the book "Me, But Better," successfully worked to become less neurotic and more extroverted by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations like improv classes. According to University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, this approach involves identifying desired traits and consistently adopting behaviors associated with them. While the principles are simple, execution is difficult, but it offers a new way to approach mental health and personal growth.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes it has identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier "La Buse" Levasseur in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, silver, and jewels, estimated to be worth over $100 million today. The wreck was discovered near Nosy Boraha, an island off Madagascar that was a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure of La Buse, which he famously alluded to before his execution, remains a 300-year-old mystery.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: US Trade Strategy with Southeast Asia Shifts from Partnership to Rent-Seeking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States' trade strategy towards the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has become transactional and extractive rather than collaborative. The author contends that Washington is no longer offering genuine economic integration but is instead monetizing access to its market through higher tariffs and mandatory purchases. This "fee for access" model is seen as undermining the competitiveness of Asean economies, turning them into rent-payers instead of strategic partners. The article suggests this short-term, transactional approach could damage long-term relationships and regional sovereignty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a report from the Lowy Institute, China's influence in Southeast Asia is increasing as it becomes the region's largest infrastructure financier. This rise coincides with significant cuts to foreign aid budgets by the United States and the European Union. The report notes that with the West pulling back, the center of development finance is shifting east to Beijing, as well as Tokyo and Seoul. China is leveraging this opportunity to enhance its regional standing through major infrastructure projects, like high-speed rail, while maintaining a policy of "no political strings attached" to its aid.

          <p>A fragile calm has settled over the Syrian city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes between local Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The fighting, which reportedly killed over 1,000 people and displaced at least 128,000, was sparked by the abduction of a Druze merchant. A ceasefire was announced and government forces have closed roads into the city to contain tensions, though local Druze fighters remain in control. The humanitarian situation is dire, with hospitals overwhelmed and a severe shortage of medical supplies reported in the city.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center after a judge ruled it was subject to Georgia's open records law.

The released documents reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to thwart a public referendum on the project. Activists say this ruling is a crucial step toward preventing such foundations from operating as a "black box" to bypass public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists argue that the Trump administration's aggressive push for fossil fuels is setting back environmental progress by decades. In his first six months, the president has used a declared "national energy emergency" to justify expanding oil, gas, and coal production while cutting green energy subsidies and research. These actions, including gutting tax credits for renewables and proposing to close climate research labs, have occurred alongside climate-related disasters. Scholars contend the policies are unscientific, benefit fossil-fuel industry cronies, and undermine the nation's ability to address the well-documented impacts of climate change.</p>

Patients have experienced weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps balance hormone levels and reduce testosterone. While more research is needed and insurance coverage remains a major hurdle, these drugs are seen as a potential game-changer for a condition that has lacked effective, comprehensive treatments for decades.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new "Gold Standard for Science" policy that critics argue is designed to manufacture doubt and undermine scientific evidence that conflicts with its political goals. The policy gives political appointees, rather than career scientists, the authority to define scientific integrity and decide which evidence is credible. This framework echoes tactics used by the tobacco industry to delay regulation by demanding unattainable levels of certainty. Analysts warn this will allow the administration to block public health and environmental protections by cherry-picking data and elevating uncertainty over established scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Vibrio bacteria, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections, are becoming more common in European coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas. Scientists link this increase to climate change, as the bacteria thrive in the warmer, less saline conditions that are now more prevalent. Vibriosis is typically contracted by eating raw shellfish or through open wounds exposed to infected water. While infections are still relatively rare, health agencies are warning of a heightened risk, especially during summer heatwaves, and advise the public to take precautions to avoid exposure.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused some council officials of deliberately obstructing the work of his party's newly elected councillors. After gaining control of 10 councils in May, Farage claims that in some areas, his representatives are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies that are resistant to change. He defended controversial spending, such as hiring political assistants in Warwickshire, as necessary to overcome this "obstructionism." The party's cost-cutting "Doge" unit has also faced criticism for its slow progress, which Farage attributes to the party's small size and the challenges of dealing with entrenched administrations.</p>
