          <p>Tech giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unprecedented deal with the U.S. government, committing to pay 15% of their revenue from specific high-performance chip sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. The move has been met with mixed reactions, as some policy experts question whether a financial payment can truly mitigate national security risks associated with selling powerful technology to a strategic competitor. This occurs amidst easing trade tensions and broader efforts by the U.S. to bolster its domestic tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Australian government has declared its intention to officially recognize a Palestinian state during the United Nations General Assembly this September. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the decision is aimed at advancing a two-state solution, which he described as the best path to ending the ongoing conflict and suffering in the Middle East. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations, including the UK, France, and Canada, that have recently made similar announcements. The decision comes amid increasing international pressure on Israel to conclude its military operations in Gaza, with Israeli officials criticizing such recognitions as a "reward for terrorism."</p>

          <p>Warnings are escalating on platforms like TikTok regarding "Feel Free" tonics and other products containing kratom, a substance with opioid-like effects. Medical experts and individuals sharing personal stories describe the substance as highly addictive, with some users requiring hospitalization for withdrawal symptoms after consuming large quantities. The products are widely available in stores, and the FDA has expressed concern, recently recommending scheduling action to control a concentrated byproduct of the kratom plant. The manufacturer, Botanic Tonics, disputes the claims of widespread addiction, though it previously settled a class-action lawsuit for failing to warn consumers about the product's risks.</p>

          <p>Two blind women from Florida have criticized Southwest Airlines after they became the only passengers on a flight from New Orleans to Orlando. The women, Sherri Brun and Camille Tate, stated they were "forgotten about" during a nearly five-hour delay when most other passengers were rebooked onto an earlier flight from a different gate. They argue the airline failed to provide the effective communication required for passengers with disabilities under the Air Carrier Access Act. Southwest Airlines disputed the claim that they were forgotten, stating the women remained on their originally scheduled flight, and offered them a $100 travel voucher for the delay.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries, including Canada, India, and Australia, to the program. This "deport now, appeal later" scheme now covers 23 nations and is intended to prevent offenders from using the appeals process to prolong their stay in the UK. Under the policy, foreign nationals whose human rights claims are refused can be removed and participate in their appeal hearings remotely via video link. The government argues this will save taxpayer money and enhance public safety, though critics have raised concerns about due process and implementation.</p>

Separately, Vice President JD Vance refuted reports of a meeting at his residence concerning Jeffrey Epstein, clarifying that a White House meeting occurred but did not discuss that topic. President Trump also announced a news conference to address crime in Washington D.C., a claim that is contrasted by official police data showing a decrease in crime rates. Additionally, Vance downplayed speculation about a potential 2028 presidential ticket with Marco Rubio, stating their focus remains on governance.</p>

          <p>As part of a major road safety overhaul, the UK government is considering a proposal to require drivers over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests every three years to renew their licenses. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" licensing system after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight. The new strategy, expected in the autumn, may also include tightening the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introducing penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The government aims to reduce road fatalities and injuries through these tougher regulations and enforcement measures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article by physicist Frank Wilczek explores the concept of gravitational waves emitted by newly formed black holes, describing them as a form of "strange, pure music." While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the process of their formation—such as from a star's collapse or the merger of two smaller black holes—causes the surrounding space-time to vibrate. These vibrations, or "ringdown," quickly settle into a stable, mathematically perfect shape defined only by the black hole's mass and spin. These gravitational wave signals provide a unique way for scientists to observe and understand these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

          <p>China's new nationwide childcare subsidy program, which offers families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three, is expected to have a varied impact across the country. According to analysis, the subsidy will be most significant in less affluent regions where the payment represents a much larger percentage of the average resident's income. For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai. This structure could lead to a more noticeable boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

This sustained warmth has led to sightings of species not typically common in UK waters, such as bluefin tuna, octopus, and mauve stinger jellyfish. Scientists and amateur naturalists note that these changes are indicative of an ecosystem in flux. At the same time, the extreme heat is stressing cold-water species like cod, pushing them further north and posing significant challenges to local fishing communities who rely on them for their livelihood.</p>

The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with the lead but finished one shot out of the playoff, tied for third. For Rose, the win was a gratifying return to form, proving he can still compete and win against the world's best players.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to simplify the hiring process for newly qualified nurses and midwives in England's NHS. The changes aim to address a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies by cutting red tape and allowing hospital trusts to recruit staff based on anticipated needs, even before formal vacancies arise. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the goal is to support new graduates and help cut patient waiting lists. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the measures would be funded amid already strained budgets.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who killed a police officer during an attack at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as a man who had become fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. The suspect, Patrick Joseph White, allegedly blamed the vaccine for personal health issues before he opened fire on the campus, killing Officer David Rose. White was later found dead inside a nearby building. The incident has prompted a union representing CDC workers to demand that federal officials publicly condemn vaccine misinformation, arguing that it fuels a climate of hostility and puts scientists at risk of violence.</p>

          <p>Danone U.S. has issued a voluntary nationwide recall for its YoCrunch yogurt products after consumers reported finding sharp, transparent plastic pieces mixed in with the dome-packaged toppings.

The recall applies to a wide range of YoCrunch products with expiration dates from July through September. This incident highlights broader concerns about the health risks associated with plastic packaging and the potential for contaminants to enter the food supply during the manufacturing process.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Trey Lance is making a strong case for the backup role on the Los Angeles Chargers, closing the gap with veteran Taylor Heinicke after another impressive preseason performance. In the Chargers' 27-13 victory over the New Orleans Saints, Lance demonstrated his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes. In contrast, Heinicke, who started the game, appeared rusty in his first action of the preseason. The game also highlighted strong showings from edge rusher Caleb Murphy and undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who recorded two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

Fueled by dry, windy conditions, the blaze remains only minimally contained, and over a thousand firefighters are working to protect homes and infrastructure.

The man admitted to purchasing the monkey in Mexico and lacked the required permits for its importation, initially claiming it was for his children before stating he intended to sell it. This incident underscores the persistent problem of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens endangered species like the spider monkey, poses risks of disease transmission, and disrupts ecosystems.

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a surprising and plausible link between nose-picking and an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that damaging the nasal tissue can create a direct pathway for certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, to travel up the olfactory nerve to the brain. In response to this bacterial presence, the mouse brains produced more amyloid-beta protein, the same protein that forms plaques found in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's. While the findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental triggers of this complex neurodegenerative disease.</p>

The president's call comes after he ordered federal law enforcement into the city's streets and signed an order making it easier to arrest homeless individuals. D.C.

          <p>Democratic leaders are strongly criticizing the Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, labeling it an undemocratic attempt to "cheat" in future elections. The controversy has escalated as Texas Democratic lawmakers have left the state to deny the state House a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on the new maps which could give the GOP five more House seats. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the move a tactic to "whittle away" at democracy. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the fleeing lawmakers arrested upon their return and to keep the legislature in a perpetual special session.</p>

Vance confirmed that President Trump is "thinking about it" but has not yet made a firm decision, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China economic relationship. This potential move represents another attempt by the administration to exert pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, this time by targeting a key economic partner of the Kremlin. In response, Beijing's embassy in Washington stated that its trade with Russia is normal and conducted within the framework of international law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria and collaborator Adidas have issued apologies after facing criticism for "cultural appropriation" over their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe. The footwear, inspired by traditional huarache sandals from Mexico, was reportedly produced in China without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated the design. The backlash was significant, with even Mexico's president speaking out against the practice. In his apology, Chavarria expressed deep regret for not developing the shoe in direct partnership with the Oaxacan community, and Adidas has committed to engaging in a respectful dialogue to repair the damage.</p>
