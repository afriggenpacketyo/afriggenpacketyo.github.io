          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the upcoming week is crucial for determining the future of U.S. involvement in Russia-Ukraine war negotiations, emphasizing that President Trump is increasing pressure on both countries to reach a peace agreement. Rubio indicated that while progress has been made, the final steps remain the most challenging and must occur soon. He also cautioned that the U.S. cannot continue dedicating resources to the effort indefinitely if it does not yield results. Rubio stressed the need to determine if both sides genuinely desire peace after 90 days of negotiations. </p>

          <p>The Chinese coastguard has reportedly seized a small sandbank called Sandy Cay in the South China Sea, intensifying the territorial dispute with the Philippines. The Philippine government has yet to formally respond to the seizure, which China claims is an implementation of "maritime control and exercise of sovereign jurisdiction." The White House has expressed deep concern over the move, warning that it threatens regional stability and violates international law. This action occurs as US and Philippine forces conduct joint war scenario drills, criticized by China as provocative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Green Party is calling for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to withdraw its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." Co-leader Carla Denyer argues the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces. The guidance, issued after a Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" and "sex" as biological, allows transgender women to be excluded from women-only spaces. Denyer questions the implications for trans people denied access to facilities aligning with their gender or birth sex, and raises concerns about lesbian associations including trans women. </p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's trade negotiation tactics, describing them as "strategic uncertainty" to gain leverage with trading partners. Bessent stated that Trump's high tariffs serve as a stick, while the carrot is the potential for countries to remove their own trade barriers and engage in fair trade practices. Bessent estimated that a comprehensive trade deal with China could take months to finalize but an agreement in principle, coupled with good behavior from trading partners, could prevent tariffs from escalating. Bessent also downplayed concerns about investor confidence in the U.S. economy. </p>

          <p>The Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) reports a significant increase in requests for church asylum, driven by growing fears of deportation among refugees. The incoming government's plans to increase deportations have heightened anxiety, leading many to seek temporary protection in churches. While churches have a long tradition of providing shelter, they face increasing pressure and limitations due to high demand and stricter deportation policies.

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something "substantial" in return, specifying that he wants China to be more open to U.S. businesses and products. Trump expressed a desire for China to allow the U.S. to enter and sell its goods freely, describing it as "open China." He noted that a deal to this effect was previously close but that China backed out, suggesting that he might not even pursue it again due to China's reluctance.

Power, fiber, water, and land scarcity are driving a reshuffling of priorities, with major players like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon still planning significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure.

          <p>Taiwan is experiencing growing uncertainty regarding the reliability of American support following recent tariff actions by President Trump. The imposition of a 32 percent tariff on Taiwanese exports to the US, exceeding previous expectations, has stunned policymakers in Taipei. Taiwan's exclusion from the initial round of trade negotiations during a grace period for tariffs has raised questions about whether the island's strategic value is being primarily judged by its economic and military contributions. This has fueled concerns about the strength of the US-Taiwan relationship.</p>

The territory's 2 million Palestinians have been sealed off from imports, including food and medicine, leading to severe shortages and malnutrition.
