          <p>The Trump administration has deported a group of non-citizens convicted of violent crimes, including murder and sexual assault of a child, to the African nation of Eswatini. These individuals, from countries like Cuba and Yemen, were sent to Eswatini because their home nations refused to accept them. This action is part of a controversial and expanding U.S. policy to deport individuals to third-party countries, a practice that has faced legal challenges regarding due process and the safety of the destination nations. The administration is expediting these deportations following a recent Supreme Court ruling in its favor.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old Texas woman, Pamela Jean Stanley, has been indicted on multiple felony charges, including attempted murder, for allegedly plotting to kill her ex-husband. Authorities say she planned to mail him fentanyl-laced chocolates disguised as a honeymoon gift following his recent engagement. The plot was thwarted after a tipster alerted law enforcement, leading to a sting operation where Stanley was arrested after attempting to acquire what she believed was fentanyl. A search of her vehicle also uncovered a significant quantity of methamphetamine.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a group of House Republicans who initially voted to block a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills have agreed to support the legislation after a meeting at the White House. The procedural vote had unexpectedly failed earlier, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats, causing a temporary setback for the crypto-friendly measures during the House's "Crypto Week." The bills include the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation and another to clarify oversight between the SEC and CFTC. This reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, described the trend of Chinese academics and researchers leaving the United States to return to China as a "great loss" for America. Speaking in Beijing, Huang, an immigrant from Taiwan himself, reflected on how the U.S. enabled his success and expressed hope that it remains a country where others can pursue their dreams. His comments come amid worsening U.S.-China relations, which have contributed to a 'brain drain' of talented individuals who were educated in the U.S. but are now choosing to go back to their home country.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced over $90 billion in new private investments from leading technology and energy companies aimed at developing Pennsylvania's artificial intelligence sector. The initiatives include building new data centers powered by the state's natural gas and nuclear resources, and establishing an energy innovation hub for workforce training. The event, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, brought together major industry leaders and government officials. The announcement was met with protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and AI for surveillance, leading to minor clashes with police.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly voted to advance a White House rescissions package aimed at clawing back $9.4 billion in previously approved funding. Vice President JD Vance cast tie-breaking votes to overcome opposition from all Democrats and three Republican senators. The legislation primarily targets foreign aid programs managed by USAID but also seeks to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The move has created friction, with some Republicans opposing cuts to global health initiatives and Democrats warning it undermines the bipartisan appropriations process.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to "come forward and explain" her previous comments about reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's alleged "client list." This comes after the Justice Department stated no such list was found, sparking backlash from some of the administration's supporters. Johnson's statement reflects a growing push within the Republican party for more transparency on the Epstein case, with some lawmakers calling for Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.

          <p>The Trump administration reportedly demanded that the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, fire its CEO, Don Moul. The board resisted the ultimatum, defending Moul's performance in a letter to the White House. This conflict arose after country singer John Rich, a Trump ally, publicly campaigned against a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville, a project the TVA has since paused. Sources suggest this move may be part of a larger strategy by the administration to install a more aligned CEO and potentially privatize the historically government-owned utility.</p>

Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical reef-building species, has been lost to warming oceans and disease. Researchers selected tougher coral from Honduras's Tela Bay, which lives in more challenging conditions, to create a more resilient hybrid nicknamed the "Flonduran." The first of these crossbred corals have now been planted off the Miami coast, with hopes they can better survive future marine heatwaves and help protect Florida's coastline.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty for his role in an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges stem from events culminating in the January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings by his supporters after he spread unfounded claims of voter fraud. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. The World Gold Council reports this trend is driven by soaring gold prices and the desire to support domestic industry, although it can present challenges if the country lacks certified refining capabilities.

Cramer noted that investors focused on BlackRock's lower-than-expected net inflows and Wells Fargo's reduced guidance for net interest income.

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent over two decades in prison. His 2001 conviction was based on unreliable witness testimony, and he was found factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The case against him was weak, with multiple alibi witnesses and evidence that a cast he was wearing would have made it difficult to commit the crime. The settlement provides restitution for the years Torres lost while incarcerated.</p>

He always maintained his innocence and never revealed the location of Falconio's body, which has denied the victim's family closure for over two decades.

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, an analyst from the Thomas B. Fordham Institute weighed in on the implications. Michael Petrilli stated that while the cuts are significant, especially to the Office for Civil Rights, most students and teachers are unlikely to feel a direct impact due to the federal government's already small role in daily schooling. He argued that completely closing the department is unlikely as it would require Congressional approval, but he anticipates it will be a smaller agency by the end of the administration.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned after concerns over patient safety, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. It further states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow several high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs whom they believed were fully qualified doctors, prompting calls for greater clarity on their roles and limitations.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million restoration project. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the building's iron structure, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. The renovation is necessary due to the toll the hot, humid interior has taken on the 175-year-old structure. The project will also upgrade the heating system to make the glasshouse net-zero, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

The watchdog ruled that this language implied the drink could treat anxiety, a claim not permitted on the national register for food and supplement marketing.

The original military trial is now being re-examined for fairness, with allegations of torture and a rushed process under a new military regime.

Trump cited a Fannie Mae investigation, but a memo from the agency reviewed by the press noted only a "possible occupancy misrepresentation" and did not use the word "fraud."
