          <p>Former President Trump, alongside tech and energy leaders, revealed over $90 billion in private investments for Pennsylvania at a summit in Pittsburgh. The initiative aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy by building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for workforce training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted projects like Westinghouse's plan for ten new nuclear reactors, framing the investment as a historic move to create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement follows a recent $20 billion investment by Amazon for data centers in the state, though it was met with some protests regarding environmental and ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of the 2001 murder of British tourist Peter Falconio in the Australian outback, has died of cancer at age 67. He was serving a life sentence and passed away without ever disclosing the location of Falconio's body, denying his family closure. Murdoch was also found guilty of the attempted kidnapping and assault of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Despite a "no body, no parole" law, Murdoch maintained his innocence until his death. Northern Territory Police expressed regret over the unresolved aspect of the case, confirming a reward for information remains active.</p>

          <p>Contractor Daniel Butierez has won the Republican primary for a special election in Arizona's 7th congressional district, a seat formerly held by the late Democratic Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva. With the district located along the U.S.-Mexico border, Butierez centered his campaign on border security and aligning with former President Trump's immigration policies. He will now face the Democratic nominee, Adelita Grijalva, the daughter of the late congressman, in the September special election. The district is considered reliably Democratic, presenting a significant challenge for the Republican candidate in the upcoming race to fill the long-held seat.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that within a decade, the world's factories will be predominantly operated by robots and artificial intelligence. Speaking at an expo in Beijing, he stated that automation and machine learning are set to replace humans in many manufacturing roles, particularly those that are repetitive or hazardous. Huang emphasized that AI is becoming a fundamental infrastructure, comparable to electricity or the internet, and is already revolutionizing supply chains. He also praised the progress of Chinese tech firms in leveraging AI, highlighting platforms like WeChat, Taobao, and Douyin as iconic examples of its application.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order creating national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move addresses the complex system of state laws that currently govern how college athletes can be compensated for endorsements, appearances, and other activities. The action follows a House subcommittee's advancement of the SCORE Act, a bill aiming to federalize NIL regulations, though concerns exist about its potential to grant excessive power to the NCAA. The landscape of college athletics has been dramatically altered since 2021 rules allowed student-athletes to earn significant income, a shift from decades of NCAA restrictions on player compensation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would establish a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods exported to the United States. In exchange, he stated that the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant shift in the trade relationship. As part of the deal, Trump claimed Indonesia committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft. The announcement, which follows direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, has not yet been formally confirmed by Jakarta. This approach mirrors recent trade negotiations with other nations where the U.S. has dictated new tariff terms.</p>

          <p>The White House reportedly delivered an ultimatum to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, demanding the dismissal of its CEO, Don Moul. This directive follows a public campaign by country singer John Rich against a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville, which caught President Trump's attention. The TVA board resisted the order, arguing in a letter that Moul's short tenure has aligned with the administration's energy goals. Sources suggest the move may be a pretext for the administration to install a more allied CEO and potentially set the stage for privatizing the government-owned utility.</p>

His presidency, which ended in 2023, was marked by economic challenges, escalating insecurity, and criticism over human rights. Thousands of mourners, including current President Bola Tinubu, attended the service. The Nigerian government has declared a seven-day period of national mourning to honor the former leader's life and service to the country.</p>

          <p>Michael Bernard Bell, 54, was executed by lethal injection in Florida for the 1993 murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith. Bell was convicted of opening fire with an AK-47 on a car outside a bar in what was believed to be a revenge killing targeting the vehicle's previous owner. The execution is the 26th in the United States this year, surpassing the total for all of the previous year, with Florida leading all states. Bell was also convicted in separate cases for three additional murders. His final appeals were denied by both the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's heightened immigration enforcement, some migrant workers are using mobile applications that crowdsource and display the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. An app named Coqui allows users to report and view ICE activity, helping them to avoid potential arrest and detention, even if they have legal status. The app's developer, a non-immigrant animal rescue operator, created it after his own employees became too fearful to leave their homes for work. ICE officials have expressed concern that such apps are dangerous and could be used to impede law enforcement or ambush agents.</p>

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss. The prosecutor's filing accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming a criminal association to violently overthrow the democratic order by spreading false voter fraud claims and inciting unrest. The charges are linked to the January 8, 2023, riots where his supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison. The former president has dismissed the charges as a politically motivated "witch hunt."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows nations like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving their foreign exchange holdings. The approach is also cheaper, as it avoids intermediary fees and allows for purchases at a slight discount to international prices. This trend reflects a broader global move by central banks to increase their gold reserves as a hedge against geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

He noted the positive reaction for Nvidia after the White House cleared its chip sales to China, which sent the stock to a new high. In contrast, he expressed disappointment with the market's negative response to earnings reports from BlackRock and Wells Fargo. BlackRock's stock fell due to lower-than-expected net inflows, while Wells Fargo's shares dropped after the bank cut its guidance for net interest income, despite being freed from a long-standing Federal Reserve asset cap.

Torres was convicted in 2001 based on shaky witness testimony, despite having a cast that made firing a gun unlikely and multiple witnesses placing him at a family party. His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts by the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, clearing his record and paving the way for the civil settlement.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to proceed with dismantling the Department of Education, a policy expert weighed in on the potential impacts. Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute noted that while many teachers and students may not feel immediate effects due to the department's small federal role, the cuts will be significant for certain functions. He highlighted that the Office for Civil Rights and the Financial Aid Office have borne the brunt of the layoffs, raising concerns about the government's ability to handle discrimination complaints and manage student loan programs.

The tree was a beloved Northumberland landmark and a place of solace for many, including King himself. He described the remaining stump and the "yawning gap" in the landscape as deeply overwhelming, reflecting on the loss of a natural icon that he would have visited for reflection after the recent death of his friend and co-star, Dave Myers.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While patient families welcomed the call for clarity, the British Medical Association, a doctors' union, argued the review should have gone further in restricting their scope of practice.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will address the toll that the hot, humid internal climate has taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps, significantly reducing its carbon footprint while preserving its Victorian aesthetic.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized claims that its products can help people feel calm and reduce stress. The watchdog found that the ad for the cucumber and mint flavored drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, implied health benefits that are not permitted on the official register for food and drink marketing. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" would lead consumers to believe the drink could reduce anxiety, a prohibited implication. The company stated it has removed the claims and must not run the ad again in its current form.</p>

He argued that the government failed to properly plan for the consequences of a Leave vote, particularly regarding the complex issue of the Irish border.

Kim, who shot Park during a dinner, was convicted of insurrection and attempting to seize power, but his family argues he acted to prevent a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests and restore democracy. The case is being revisited 46 years later after the court accepted that Kim was tortured during the initial investigation under a military regime. The retrial forces a national re-examination of a pivotal moment in the country's history and the legacies of both the assassin and the dictator he killed.</p>
