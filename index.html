          <p>Court documents revealed that Vance Boelter, charged with the murders of two Minnesota lawmakers and the shooting of another and his wife, was a "prepper" with a "bailout plan" for his family. His wife told investigators they were preparing for major incidents and were instructed to go to her mother's home. Boelter also allegedly had a business partner in Washington involved in a security company and fishing outfit in Congo, Africa. Investigators found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family released a statement expressing their grappling with the risks of public service and calling for civility.

          <p>President Trump suggested he may fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing Powell for keeping interest rates steady. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates faster, although he previously stated he had "no intention" of firing him. Federal law allows firing Fed governors "for cause," but the Supreme Court has exempted the Fed from presidential control. Powell has stated he will not resign if asked by Trump. The central bank's decision to hold rates steady aims to balance economic growth with inflation control, a strategy that has drawn Trump's ire.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has unveiled HarmonyOS 6, its proprietary operating system, along with new AI models and the CloudMatrix 384 AI rack architecture. The beta version of HarmonyOS 6 features AI agents, with over 8 million registered developers and 30,000 apps available in its ecosystem. Richard Yu Chengdong acknowledged that HarmonyOS trails iOS and Android in global reach and app support, but emphasized that the top 5,000 apps account for most consumer time spent on Huawei devices. The HarmonyOS Agent Framework enables developers to create AI agents without building foundation models.</p>
