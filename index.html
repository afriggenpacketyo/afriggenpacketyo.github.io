          <p>The blobfish, once known as the world's ugliest animal, has been named Fish of the Year by a New Zealand environmental group. The annual competition aims to raise awareness for New Zealand's marine life, and the blobfish's win highlights the importance of protecting even unusual creatures. The blobfish's unusual appearance is due to its deep-sea habitat, where the high water pressure keeps its body intact; its shape deforms when brought to the surface.</p>
