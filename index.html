          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported erroneously and later returned to face new criminal charges, has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Baltimore, now held in a Virginia detention center. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has issued an order "absolutely forbidding" his immediate deportation from the continental United States, with a temporary block through Wednesday and consideration for further extension. His legal team asserts that the federal government is attempting to compel a guilty plea in his human smuggling case by threatening to deport him to Uganda, despite his expressed preference for Costa Rica. The judge also mandated that Abrego Garcia not be moved and ensures his access to legal counsel, highlighting the ongoing legal battle over his immigration status.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced an investigation into a "tragic mishap" after reports indicated an Israeli strike on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza resulted in at least 20 fatalities, including five journalists from various international news outlets. Netanyahu expressed deep regret, affirming that Israel's military operations are aimed at Hamas terrorists and do not intentionally target civilians. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) suggested the artillery rounds were fired to target a Hamas surveillance camera on the hospital's roof. This incident underscores the perilous conditions for journalists and medical personnel operating in the active war zone, prompting a thorough and professional military inquiry.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, legally known as Montero Lamar Hill, has entered a not guilty plea to multiple felony charges, including battery with injury to a police officer and resisting arrest. The charges originate from an incident last week in Los Angeles, where police responded to reports of a man wandering naked and subsequently alleged that the Grammy-winning artist charged at them. Following his detention, he was hospitalized for a potential overdose. The 26-year-old musician's bail was set at $75,000 during his arraignment, as he continues to prepare for the upcoming release of his second studio album, "Dreamboy."</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been taken into ICE custody and is being processed for deportation to Uganda, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), days after his release from criminal custody. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a strong statement, accusing Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, claims his family denies. His attorneys argue his detention is punitive, weaponizing the immigration system to coerce a guilty plea by using Uganda as a "stick" against his preference for Costa Rica. A U.S. district court in Maryland has temporarily halted his deportation, pending further legal proceedings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, popular among seniors for accessing home equity, require borrowers to continue paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, despite not having monthly mortgage payments. Failure to meet these obligations can lead to severe consequences, including the entire loan balance becoming immediately due and payable, unlike traditional mortgages. Lenders can initiate swift foreclosure proceedings, which can be particularly distressing for long-term homeowners. Moreover, missed obligations can result in liens or judgments against the home, potentially damaging credit scores, even though the reverse mortgage debt itself doesn't appear on credit reports.

          <p>Starbucks shares experienced a 2% drop during Monday's trading session, largely attributed to a Bloomberg report indicating the coffee giant is scaling back production at its five U.S. plants. These facilities, which previously operated 24/7, are set to shift to a new five-day schedule starting in January. While cost-cutting was cited as a reason, the article also suggests that Starbucks does not require its plants to run continuously to meet current demand, implying a potential decrease in sales. This move follows six consecutive quarters of negative same-store sales, raising concerns among investors about the company's growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, Trump was pressed on whether he would send the National Guard to Republican-led states to combat crime, to which he responded "Sure," while reiterating his focus on Democrat-led areas and criticisms of cashless bail policies.</p>

          <p>Wildfires are actively burning in northern California's Napa County and central Oregon's Deschutes County, destroying multiple homes and prompting thousands of evacuations amidst hot, dry conditions. California's Pickett fire has charred over 6,800 acres, threatening 500 structures in wine country, while Oregon's Flat fire has destroyed ten structures, including four homes. Firefighters face challenges with high temperatures, low humidity, and increasing winds, working to protect vineyards and contain the blazes. These intense summer conditions across the U.S. West have sparked numerous wildfires, with experts attributing the increased intensity and frequency to human-caused climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to create a specialized National Guard unit for deployment in Washington, D.C., and potentially other cities, to quell civil disturbances and ensure public safety. Trump asserted the military's readiness to intervene in any city, even without a governor's request, but then hedged on plans for Chicago, stating he wouldn't act without a request from the Illinois governor. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, strongly opposed such a move, calling it "illegal and costly," "undemocratic," and "unconstitutional." The White House had not directly communicated potential deployment plans to Johnson's office.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, aiming to validate corrective upgrades after three prior failures. The mission seeks to test the Super Heavy first stage for controlled splashdown and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory for an Indian Ocean splashdown, including deploying Starlink simulators and engine restarts. This flight is crucial for restoring confidence in the rocket's viability for future moon missions, particularly a NASA-planned 2027 landing, which some experts doubt can be achieved with the current architecture and complex in-orbit refueling requirements. Despite challenges, NASA's acting administrator expressed optimism about SpaceX's ability to meet timelines.</p>

While the individual has recovered and the risk of transmission within the U.S. is considered very low, this detection raises vigilance. The New World screwworm, typically found in South America, poses a significant threat to livestock, and its northward spread has prompted federal action.

Trump's declaration comes days after he praised Republican Texas legislators for passing a redistricting plan designed to favor the GOP in five additional U.S. House races. Newsom promptly responded with "BRING IT" on social media. This mid-decade redistricting push by California aims to counterbalance the Texas gerrymandering, intensifying the national political battle over electoral maps and the balance of power in Congress.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic analyzes President Trump's actions in his second term, arguing they signal a systematic erosion of the rule of law and a move towards arbitrary personal rule. It highlights instances like the FBI raid on critic John Bolton's home, drawing parallels to Trump's own past indictments, and the alleged politicization of federal law enforcement. The piece contrasts the resistance Trump faced from nonpartisan officials in his first term with the loyalty-driven appointments in his second, suggesting a deeper perversion of government institutions. It questions whether the American system can recover if public understanding of law versus politics is fundamentally undermined.</p>

The delisting follows a Hong Kong court's liquidation order after the company failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan for its over $340 billion in debts. Evergrande's downfall, triggered by Chinese regulators' crackdown on excessive borrowing, has caused widespread defaults, halted construction, and impacted consumer spending.

The group's U.S. tour status was already uncertain after a split from their booking agency following a Coachella performance that included strong criticism of the Israeli government. Despite the cancellation of all 15 sold-out U.S. dates, the band intends to proceed with their Canadian shows and promises a larger U.S. tour after their court case.</p>
