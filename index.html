          <p>Vietnam has continued its land reclamation efforts on occupied features within the South China Sea, according to a Chinese think tank citing satellite images. Over the past six months, nearly 0.78 sq km of land has been reclaimed on 11 features in the Spratly Islands, an area contested by China and Vietnam. Since October 2021, Vietnam has reportedly reclaimed over 8.5 sq km of new land and has increased construction of military-related facilities, including harbor basins, wharves, and runways, with a 3,000-meter airstrip under construction on Barque Canada Reef.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 04:09:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is struggling to decrease the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel expenses for asylum seekers, with plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only slightly less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money is primarily used for accommodating thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK, as the supply of dispersal accommodation has not kept pace with asylum applications. While the Home Office aims to end the use of asylum hotels, critics argue there's little incentive to reduce ODA spending since it doesn't impact their budget, leading to cuts in humanitarian and development aid globally.

          <p>Tottenham captain Son Heung-min lauded recently dismissed manager Ange Postecoglou as a club "legend" who significantly altered the club's trajectory. Despite Postecoglou's sacking shortly after securing the club's first silverware in 17 years, Son expressed gratitude for the manager's belief in the team and his trust in him as captain. Other players, including Vicario, Van de Ven, and Solanke, also shared their appreciation for Postecoglou's leadership and the success achieved under his guidance. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged Postecoglou's impact while emphasizing the need for the board to fully support his successor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles is reportedly "livid" over a potential pheasant shortage at Sandringham Estate, which may lead to the cancellation of the royal family's cherished Boxing Day shoot. The shortage is attributed to a recent staff shake-up and the king's preference for maintaining the estate's game population rather than importing birds. Experts suggest this disruption may prompt the king to review the shooting tradition, which has faced criticism from animal rights groups. Some speculate that the change in plans could allow King Charles to prioritize reconciliation with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is increasingly concerned about China's growing military influence in Africa, particularly the increasing number of African military officers receiving training in China. General Michael Langley, head of US Africa Command (AFRICOM), noted that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is replicating US training programs for African personnel. This concern arises as the US shifts its approach from providing military aid to encouraging African countries to become self-reliant. China is a major supplier of military equipment, especially in the Sahel region, as leaders pivot away from Western partners.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy voiced his apprehension regarding his performance heading into the US Open, citing issues with his driver at the Canadian Open. McIlroy missed the cut at the Canadian Open after shooting an eight-over-par 78 during his second round. He struggled with a new driver, finding only 13 of 28 fairways and making a quadruple-bogey eight on the par-four fifth hole. McIlroy acknowledged the need to hit fairways at Oakmont and stated he is still searching for the missing piece off the tee.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. He appeared in federal court in Nashville, with his arraignment set for June 13, and will remain in federal custody until then. His lawyer calls the criminal charges "fantastical" and an abuse of power, alleging the Trump administration returned him not to correct their error but to prosecute him. The US Supreme Court had previously ordered Trump to facilitate Garcia's return after his deportation to El Salvador.</p>
