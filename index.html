          <p>The Department of Defense is expected to reject most of the request from the Department of Homeland Security for 20,000 troops to assist in arresting migrants, raising concerns about potential violations of federal law. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee regarding the proposed budget estimates for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2026. Hegseth and President Trump are defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amidst objections from Democrats regarding their domestic deployment. Trump vowed to use military force to suppress what he called "anarchy" and told soldiers he would "liberate" Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The White House attempted to clarify President Donald Trump's earlier statement about using "heavy force" against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade, stating that the president supports peaceful protests and the First Amendment. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that Trump does not support violence or assaulting law enforcement officers, contrasting this with Democrats' alleged tolerance of unrest. Trump's initial comments suggested protesters would be "met with heavy force," but he later softened his stance, stating that the military's presence would render the protests insignificant. Approximately 6,700 soldiers will participate in the parade, which will feature military vehicles, aircraft, and a last-minute request for an Air Force Thunderbirds flyover.</p>

This comes after Trump indicated openness to reconciliation in an interview, mentioning he felt "a little disappointed" but harbored "no hard feelings." The conflict arose after Musk stepped back from a White House role and condemned Trump's tax bill, even claiming Trump appeared in unreleased government files linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which the White House refuted. Trump had previously criticized Musk and threatened to cancel government contracts with SpaceX.</p>

          <p>David Hogg, the 25-year-old progressive activist, faces potential removal from his Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair position after the committee voted to hold a new election. The decision follows a complaint alleging that the original election process violated the DNC's charter and discriminated against women of color candidates. This development comes after Hogg stirred controversy within the party due to his $20 million pledge to primary-challenge older Democrats through his political action group, Leaders We Deserve. DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed frustration with Hogg's actions, leading to an ultimatum for Hogg to either rescind his vice-chair position or forego his political influence through his PAC.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from deporting Khalil due to Rubio's determination that his presence compromised U.S. foreign policy interests, citing potential First Amendment violations. While the ruling allows the administration to pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application, the judge found that the primary reason for his detention was the Rubio determination.

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered a speech decrying ICE raids and the military presence in California ordered by President Trump, framing it as a call to action against authoritarianism. Newsom highlighted the dangers of escalating force against citizens, potentially alienating Trump's supporters and galvanizing resistance. The success of Newsom's strategy depends on the perception of aggression between the military and protesters in Los Angeles. Steven Levitsky, a professor at Harvard University, suggested Newsom's leadership could help shake off the shock of recent authoritarian actions, particularly as fear silences others. The governor's reach has skyrocketed, with millions watching his address and hundreds of thousands following him on social media.</p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers have fallen to a five-month low in May, dropping 11% from April to $4.55 per dozen, due to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal easing in demand.

While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to the previous year. The bird flu outbreak, which began in 2022, continues to impact the industry, with a recent outbreak affecting nearly 1.4 million birds in Arizona.</p>
