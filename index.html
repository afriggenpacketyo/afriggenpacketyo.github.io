          <p>China and Central Asian nations have expressed shared security concerns at a recent summit, signaling closer ties amidst global instability. While the Kremlin dismisses concerns about waning Russian influence, diplomatic observers note Moscow's limited capacity to counterbalance China's growing presence in the region. Beijing is careful not to directly challenge Russia's role as a security guarantor, but its economic and diplomatic clout is undeniably increasing. The summit highlights the shifting dynamics in Central Asia as Russia remains preoccupied with the conflict in Ukraine. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Meta is aggressively pursuing top AI talent, including executives from Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence startup, after a failed acquisition attempt. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman to work on AI products under Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang. This move follows a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI and reflects Meta's determination to compete with Google and OpenAI in developing advanced AI models.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate has climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest level since January 2023, driven by a significant increase in rice prices. Rice prices more than doubled year-over-year, marking the largest increase in over half a century, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held rates steady at 0.5% but indicated it would consider future rate hikes based on underlying inflation trends. Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could further impact energy prices, adding to inflationary pressures, but some analysts expect food price pressures to wane in the coming months (not investment advice).

          <p>China's central bank has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month, a decision influenced by a trade deal with the U.S. that eased some growth worries. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. Trade war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade.

          <p>A national security expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The depth and protection of the facility are not fully known, and the weapon has never been used in practice. While an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it entirely. The expert suggests that continued military strikes would not be a good option for achieving a nuclear-free Iran, and that diplomatic solutions are necessary.
