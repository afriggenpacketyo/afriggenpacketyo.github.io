          <p>The BBC has stated it regrets not cutting the live broadcast of Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance, during which the singer led chants of "death to the IDF." The broadcaster acknowledged the comments were antisemitic and unacceptable, vowing to review its live event guidelines. The incident has drawn condemnation from the UK government and festival organizers, with the broadcast regulator Ofcom launching an investigation into why the remarks were aired. The band's singer has since defended his political activism without directly referencing the specific chants.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to outline significant concessions on its proposed welfare reforms in an effort to prevent a rebellion from its own MPs. Following a threatened revolt by over 120 Labour backbenchers, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration scaled back the planned cuts, reducing projected savings from Â£5 billion to Â£2 billion annually. Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) to new claimants only and reversing a freeze on the health component of Universal Credit. Despite the concessions, some MPs remain opposed, viewing the vote as a "leap in the dark" without a full understanding of the poverty impact.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has called for reforms to the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that the product can be detrimental for some savers. LISAs, designed for first-time home purchases or retirement, offer a 25% government bonus on savings but impose a significant penalty for early withdrawals not used for a home. The Treasury Committee report highlighted that this penalty means individuals can end up with less money than they originally invested. The committee also raised concerns about the product's complexity and its "nonsensical" rules that penalize benefit claimants, questioning if it's the best use of public funds.

The data shows that 45% of registered asylum-seekers are women and 27% are minors.

          <p>France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have jointly condemned what they describe as "threats" from Iran directed at Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The criticism came after Tehran rejected the IAEA's request to visit its nuclear sites that were recently bombed during a conflict with Israel and the US. The European powers urged Iran to resume full cooperation with the agency in line with its legal obligations. This diplomatic friction occurs as Israel signals its interest in expanding normalization agreements with more Arab nations, including Syria and Lebanon.</p>

According to a newly released audit, the hacker gained access to Mexico City's public surveillance cameras and phone data in 2018. This allowed the cartel to monitor an FBI official and identify people they met with, who were then intimidated or killed. The report highlights the growing challenge law enforcement faces from advanced technology being used by sophisticated criminal organizations to compromise operations and personnel.</p>

          <p>UEFA has delayed its decision on whether Crystal Palace will be allowed to compete in next season's Europa League, a spot the club earned by winning the FA Cup. The issue stems from UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as Palace's co-owner, John Textor, also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. The decision is now pending the outcome of Lyon's appeal against a demotion to Ligue 2 by French football authorities due to financial issues. If Lyon's relegation is upheld, they would relinquish their Europa League spot, potentially clearing the path for Crystal Palace's participation.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis argues that America's Sun Belt cities, long seen as affordable alternatives to expensive coastal metros, are now experiencing rapid home price increases. Over the past decade, cities like Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta have seen prices rise faster than in New York or San Francisco. The article posits that this is not due to different economic forces, but because these cities are now facing the same constraints that previously drove up coastal prices: hitting limits to outward sprawl and encountering restrictive zoning laws. As these cities have grown, residents have become more likely to oppose new development, mirroring the "NIMBY" dynamics that created the housing shortage on the coasts. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who leads the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding dogs requires appreciating their primary sense: smell. In an interview, she describes how dogs experience a world of information through their noses, perceiving time and space differently than visually-oriented humans. For a dog, the fading scent of its owner in a room is a way of marking the passage of time. Horowitz argues that by trying to understand this olfactory world, for instance by smelling what our dogs smell on a walk, we can move beyond our human-centric assumptions and appreciate the unique mystery of their experience.</p>

          <p>Following the recent US-Iran conflict, American security agencies have warned of potential retaliatory attacks from Tehran-backed "sleeper cells" within the United States. However, experts suggest that while Iran likely maintains clandestine cells for surveillance and targeted operations, a major terrorist attack on US soil remains a "contingency asset" for moments of existential threat. Analysts note that Iran's measured response to recent US strikes suggests a desire to de-escalate, not inflame, direct conflict. The article frames the "sleeper cell" narrative as a credible but often sensationalized threat, sometimes used for domestic political purposes.</p>

Founder Todd Graves aims to make the chain a top 10 restaurant brand overall.

          <p>An analysis by economist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde suggests that global fertility rates are falling much more rapidly than United Nations models predict, meaning the world population could begin to shrink decades earlier than the currently projected date of 2084. The article points to plummeting birth rates in middle-income countries like Colombia and Chile, which have fallen far below replacement levels and are already lower than the UN's most pessimistic forecasts. The author argues that the UN's models are overly optimistic, often assuming that fertility rates will rebound or stabilize, a trend not supported by the most recent data, portending significant economic challenges for a world that will grow old before it gets rich.</p>

          <p>A sports commentary piece reflects on the Los Angeles Sparks' struggles in the years following the departure of superstar Candace Parker, coinciding with her jersey retirement ceremony. The author argues that Parker, a two-time MVP who should have been a "Spark for life," left due to a toxic organizational culture, a decision that has haunted the franchise. In the five years since she left, the team has a losing record and has missed the playoffs, a stark contrast to their success during her tenure. The loss to the Chicago Sky on the day of her ceremony is presented as a painful reminder of the team's current lack of talent and direction.</p>

The report detailed specific instances of fraud, such as a university using funds designated for "advanced teaching equipment" to buy treadmills and barbells.

          <p>The method for calculating the annual Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) is facing scrutiny for potentially not reflecting the true expenses of retirees. The current formula uses the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which critics argue underweights key senior expenses like healthcare. Some experts propose switching to the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), which would likely result in higher annual COLAs and increased benefits for recipients. While there is no indication that the process will be changed soon, the debate highlights a fundamental issue in ensuring Social Security benefits keep pace with retirees' actual cost of living.

          <p>A firm named The Metals Company is aiming to be the first to commercially mine the deep ocean floor, a move supported by the Trump administration but opposed by many scientists and nations. The company targets a mineral-rich area of the Pacific Ocean, arguing that extracting nodules of nickel and cobalt from the seabed is less environmentally harmful than land-based mining and can help the U.S. achieve mineral independence. However, critics warn of devastating impacts on a little-studied ecosystem, and most countries argue the resources in international waters are a "common heritage of all humans" and cannot be unilaterally claimed. The company is now seeking a permit from U.S. federal agencies.</p>
