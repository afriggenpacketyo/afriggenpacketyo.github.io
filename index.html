          <p>The Israeli military has begun mobilizing forces to advance further into Gaza, conducting intense airstrikes in preparation for seizing more territory and displacing civilians, according to a New York Times article. Despite weeks of threats from Israeli leaders, there are no immediate signs of a full-scale ground invasion, although some ground troops have reportedly begun to advance. Hospitals in Gaza reported over 140 deaths on Friday alone due to the bombardments, as mediators seek to broker a new truce to halt the ongoing conflict, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. The United Nations has warned of a growing risk of famine in Gaza due to an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid.  </p>

          <p>Former NFL star Boomer Esiason has criticized Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams for his alleged attempts to avoid being drafted by the team, as detailed in a new biography, according to a Fox News article.

He advised Williams to focus on playing football and earning respect in the league. Williams, who was eventually drafted by the Bears, has not commented on the book's details but expressed excitement about the hiring of a new offensive coach.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine has killed nine people and injured seven others, according to a BBC article. The attack occurred in Bilopillia, near the Russian border, just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in over three years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a "deliberate killing of civilians," while Russian state media reported hitting a "military staging area" in the Sumy province. The talks in Istanbul did not lead to any breakthrough, but a prisoner swap was agreed upon.</p>

The Israeli government has repeatedly denied that Gaza is facing starvation and said the blockade is to force Hamas to release the remaining hostages.

          <p>A 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking haltingly and having memory lapses is the latest in a series of recent disclosures that have reopened a debate over Mr. Biden’s physical and mental fitness while in office, according to a New York Times article. The recording documents a four-minute portion of Mr. Biden’s interview with Robert K. Hur, a special counsel who investigated his handling of classified information. The audio clip comes as a forthcoming book has provided new details on Mr. Biden’s mental and physical decline and chronicled how Mr. Biden’s advisers stamped out discussion of his age-related limitations. The new debate recalls one of the Democratic Party’s most painful periods, when Mr. Biden and his allies struggled to right his re-election campaign amid calls by Democratic officials to drop out and name a successor.</p>
