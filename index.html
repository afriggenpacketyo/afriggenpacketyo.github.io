          <p>A driver rammed a vehicle into a crowd celebrating Liverpool’s championship soccer club in Liverpool, England, causing chaos and leaving people injured. The incident occurred along the parade route, which was filled with hundreds of thousands of people. Police detained a 53-year-old British man and are investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision, urging the public not to speculate or share distressing content online. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his shock and offered support to the injured and emergency services, while Liverpool F.C. conveyed their thoughts and prayers to those affected, offering full support to the authorities. The police are still investigating the motive, but the incident is reminiscent of other global episodes involving vehicles being driven into crowds.</p>

Law enforcement officials consider him extremely dangerous and are warning residents not to approach him.

          <p>California Representative Nanette Diaz Barragán is pressing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement multilingual emergency alerts for natural disasters. The call follows deadly fires in Los Angeles that affected communities with limited English proficiency. Barragán expressed concern that the FCC, under the Trump administration, has delayed enabling Wireless Emergency Alerts in multiple languages, despite having previously approved rules to do so. She argues that this delay is dangerous and jeopardizes the ability of communities to receive life-saving information in their native languages, also noting that multilingual alerts would aid first responders in ensuring effective evacuations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to cut thousands of intelligence and national security jobs across the government. The restructuring of the National Security Council continues a trend of radical downsizing in Trump's second term. These cuts could have significant implications for security at home and abroad, given the US government's reliance on intelligence officials to maintain safety. The move is viewed as a classic Washington power play, with staff being abruptly dismissed and raising concerns about the future of national security.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Scott Howard Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of accepting over $75,000 in bribes. Jenkins was found guilty of conspiracy, honest services fraud, and bribery for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs in exchange for cash and campaign contributions. Trump claimed that Jenkins and his wife were unfairly targeted by a "corrupt and Weaponized Biden" Justice Department and that the former sheriff is a victim of an overzealous prosecution. Federal prosecutors argued that those who paid the bribes were neither trained nor vetted and provided no legitimate service to the sheriff's office.</p>

          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, expresses concern over the deteriorating fiscal situation in the United States. He notes that annual federal budget deficits are high, interest rates on Treasuries have more than doubled, and the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. Orszag argues that while the absence of a debt crisis so far is not a guarantee of future stability, and that the risks posed by the heavily leveraged government are higher today than in the past. He advocates for eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and pursuing fiscal savings in entitlement programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as underscoring the country's sovereignty amid strained ties with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to deliver the Speech from the Throne, a rare event last seen in 1977, after President Trump made suggestions about annexing Canada. The visit is viewed as a strategic move to assert Canada's distinct identity and independence from the United States, especially in light of trade disputes and Trump's remarks.</p>

He urged President Trump and Harvard's president to reach an agreement, as the order leaves current international students in a precarious position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different picture of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time employment but unable to find it and those stuck in poverty-wage jobs, stood at 24.3% in April. This measure indicates that many Americans are functionally unemployed, unable to afford basic necessities and lacking opportunities for economic advancement. The wide gap between the official rate and LISEP's measure raises concerns about the accuracy of economic indicators and the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving employment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly condemned President Putin's killings in Ukraine, describing him as having “gone absolutely CRAZY,” but has not joined Europe in imposing new sanctions on Russia. This criticism follows a weekend of heavy bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Despite his comments, Trump has refused to implement new economic penalties on Russia. Experts note this pattern suggests Trump is unwilling to make Putin pay a price, leading to a strategic void.</p>
