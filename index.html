          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of escalating aerial attacks, involving two 12-hour periods starting with Iran. The agreement was made after the U.S. joined Israel's war by launching strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, which followed Israel's initial strikes on Iran's nuclear program. In the final hours before the ceasefire, Iran launched missiles, reportedly killing at least three people in Israel. Prior to Trump's announcement, Iran's foreign minister denied any ceasefire agreement but stated they would halt strikes if Israel did the same. The article highlights the delicate balance and uncertainty surrounding the ceasefire's durability. The situation remains tense despite the declared agreement.</p>

          <p>This article presents a timeline of the 2018 disappearance and murder of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old student, and the subsequent investigation and trial of Sam Woodward. Bernstein went missing while visiting family in Orange County, California, and his parents found messages on his Snapchat from Woodward, a high school classmate. Woodward initially claimed he dropped Bernstein off at a park. However, Bernstein's body was later found buried in a shallow grave, having been stabbed more than 20 times. Woodward was eventually convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement after evidence revealed he killed Bernstein because he was gay, and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending nearly two weeks of escalating aerial attacks. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran, followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over. Neither Israeli nor Iranian officials immediately commented on the proposal, and in the hours leading up to the ceasefire, Iran launched missiles, reportedly killing three people. Trump's announcement came two days after the U.S. joined the conflict by launching strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, following Israel's initial strikes on Iran's nuclear program.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which they say represents a significant advancement in using light for simultaneous operations. The chip has a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development is particularly relevant as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. The article highlights the importance of optical computing in overcoming the limitations of electronic chips, particularly in the context of AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, which raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant drops, falling below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, and the article notes that some believe Trump successfully escalated to de-escalate the situation. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for peace.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how China's dominance in rare earth elements is significantly supported by supplies from Myanmar, a country facing internal conflict. Myanmar accounts for about 57% of China's rare earth imports, particularly heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing. China has effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar, which has led to environmental and human rights concerns. The article also highlights the supply chain risks for China, as much of the rare earth extraction occurs in Myanmar's Kachin State, which is subject to ongoing civil war, leading to potential supply disruptions.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, specifically the welfare reform bill that aims to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. The MPs have signed an amendment to reject the bill in its entirety, citing concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment. The article notes that the level of support among Labour MPs indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers, and the vote on the government's bill is scheduled for July 1. The success of the amendment is uncertain, but the opposition highlights significant political tension surrounding the welfare reforms.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades to temporarily hold migrants. The facility, which will cost about $450 million a year to run, is intended to help deliver on President Trump's campaign pledge to increase deportations of illegal migrants. The proposal has faced criticism from lawmakers, including the mayor of Miami-Dade County, who expressed concerns about the environmental impact. Florida's Attorney General suggested the location would act as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' which protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. The USDA described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, claiming the move will enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups denounced the decision, arguing it threatens wildlife habitats and drinking water sources, while opponents disputed the notion that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk.
