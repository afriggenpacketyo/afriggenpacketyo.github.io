          <p>A fragile Gaza truce faced a major test as Israel launched air and artillery strikes, alleging Hamas targeted its soldiers and killed two IDF personnel. Hamas denied involvement in clashes in Rafah, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire. Following the incident, Israel halted aid transfers into Gaza and threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing closed, pending the return of remaining hostage remains. The U.S. State Department also warned of credible reports suggesting Hamas plans an attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, which Hamas rejected as "false allegations."</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The agency found "items of interest," including what appeared to be a platform high in a tree, during a sweep before Trump's arrival. Officials stated there was no impact on presidential movements and no individuals were present at the location. This incident follows a previous assassination attempt near Trump's golf club last year, raising ongoing security concerns.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a spot in the World Cup semi-finals after a significant four-run victory against India in Indore. This win marks their most important under coach Charlotte Edwards, demonstrating a newfound ability to perform under pressure. Despite batting wobbles earlier in the tournament, England held their nerve as India faltered from a strong position, particularly after Smriti Mandhana's dismissal. The team's improved composure and execution of basics, especially in fielding high-stakes catches, signal a positive shift as they head towards the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Former captain Owen Farrell's two-year absence from the England rugby team is set to continue as he was left out of head coach Steve Borthwick's initial 36-man training squad for the autumn internationals. Saracens number eight Tom Willis was also omitted due to his impending move to play in France, making him ineligible. The squad sees the inclusion of former England Under-20s captain Emeka Ilione and 19-year-old wing Noah Caluori. Farrell's exclusion follows his return to Test eligibility and recent club form, while Willis's departure is considered a setback for Borthwick.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic reduction in per capita smoking prevalence, falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, attributed to strong policies on taxation, packaging, and advertising bans. However, a Lancet study noted that the absolute number of smokers has risen by 63% due to population growth. Indonesia remains a notable exception with high male tobacco use and has not ratified the WHO's tobacco control framework, recently scrapping a planned tax hike. The region also faces a new challenge with the rapid rise of e-cigarettes, with several countries banning vaping outright.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cancel student debt under previously blocked programs, reopening a path to loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers. This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, ensures that eligible borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans will again have their loans processed for forgiveness. The administration had paused these cancellations, citing court orders, but consumer advocates argued this was an overly broad interpretation. Borrowers becoming eligible in 2025 will also benefit from tax-free relief on the federal level. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bolivians are heading to a presidential run-off election, poised to end two decades of leftist rule, as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades. The choice is between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, both promising to fix the exchange rate, restructure state businesses, and attract foreign investment. Bolivia has suffered from a shortage of US dollars, a devalued currency, and high inflation. Both candidates face the challenge of maintaining social welfare programs while needing to end costly fuel subsidies, with the future also tied to exploiting massive lithium deposits.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, as suggested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, to help households struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. This potential measure, ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, could save the average household £86 annually and cost £2.5 billion to implement. While Miliband emphasized a long-term shift to clean power to reduce bills, the immediate focus is on affordability. The government is also looking at reducing regulatory levies on energy bills, amidst political debate over net-zero policies and their impact on prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth sparked a diplomatic spat by wearing a white, blue, and red striped tie during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's White House visit, which Tass, the Russian state news agency, interpreted as matching the Russian flag. This sartorial choice fueled speculation about the Trump administration's stance on Ukraine, especially after reports of Trump pressuring Zelenskyy to cede territory. While US Vice-President JD Vance defended it as American colors, critics like Gary Kasparov highlighted broader concerns about US ties with Russia, adding to the controversy.</p>

          <p>Green Party leader Zack Polanski defended his party's proposals for an annual wealth tax on assets above £10 million and £1 billion, aiming to tackle "deep inequality" in society. He suggested such a tax could raise £15-£25 billion annually, emphasizing its role in reducing inequality rather than solely generating public investment. Polanski also argued for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, stressing that the focus should be on the "super wealthy" during times of struggle.

          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson defended his decision to label this weekend's "No Kings" rallies, which opposed President Donald Trump, as "hate America" rallies. Johnson clarified he was referring to the protesters' messages, not the Democratic Party as a whole, citing "violent rhetoric" and calls like "fascists must die." He dismissed criticism by arguing that if Trump were a "king," the government would be open, and protesters wouldn't have free speech. Johnson also discussed the commutation of George Santos' sentence and ongoing military operations in the Caribbean.</p>
