          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since implementing "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement, announced remotely with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, aims to strengthen the relationship between the two nations. While Trump touted the deal as comprehensive, 10 Downing Street indicated that negotiations were ongoing. This move follows Trump's earlier imposition of tariffs on the UK, which he later paused amid market instability and criticism, with the administration claiming the pause was decided upon due to numerous countries wanting to negotiate new trade relationships with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to rescind the "AI diffusion rule," effectively stopping artificial intelligence semiconductor limits from taking effect. Nvidia shares climbed in response to the news, with the company welcoming the administration's leadership. The rule, proposed in the last days of the Biden administration, organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on shipping advanced AI chips. The rescission offers America an opportunity to lead the next industrial revolution, create high-paying U.S. jobs, build new U.S.-supplied infrastructure, and alleviate the trade deficit, according to an Nvidia spokesperson.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele B√ºndchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The ruling narrows the scope of a sprawling multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, wiping out billions in customer funds.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has agreed to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange based in Dubai, for $2.9 billion in a deal comprising cash and Coinbase stock. The acquisition positions Coinbase as a leader in crypto derivatives, allowing it to compete with larger players like Binance.

The deal comes amid regulatory tailwinds and increased crypto M&A activity, with Coinbase aiming to diversify its revenue and enhance profitability through this acquisition.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced plans to shutter the Gates Foundation in 2045 and criticized Elon Musk for slashing funding to USAID. Gates condemned the funding cuts, saying they have led to life-saving food and medicines expiring and could result in the resurgence of diseases. Gates stated that Musk had cancelled grants to a hospital in Gaza province, Mozambique, which he said was working to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies, based on the mistaken belief that the US was supplying condoms to Hamas in Gaza in the Middle East. Gates plans to distribute virtually all of his wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years, estimating the foundation will spend more than $200 billion on these efforts.</p>

Swinney expressed worries that vulnerable individuals might feel pressured to end their lives prematurely, also noting that his religious faith and his wife's terminal condition influenced his decision. The bill, proposed by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow terminally ill people to request medical assistance to end their lives if deemed mentally fit by two doctors. While Swinney praised McArthur's efforts, he remains concerned about the potential scope of the legislation.</p>

The autopsy revealed that bullets hit his pancreas, liver, and lower lung, largely missing his heart, and that Mahdi remained conscious for up to a minute after the shots were fired. Mahdi‚Äôs lawyers have submitted the records to the South Carolina supreme court, arguing that the execution did not occur according to protocol, and that Mahdi endured pain beyond the ‚Äú10-to-15 second‚Äù window of consciousness that was expected. The state supreme court had previously assessed the method as not cruel based on the assumption that the pain would only last 10 to 15 seconds.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to announce a trade deal with the United States, which officials hope will boost economic growth. While the extent of the agreement is still unknown, economists cautioned that it would likely generate only a small boost for Britain, which is still vulnerable to global economic uncertainty. The expected deal with the United States will be welcome in Britain for a number of reasons. It‚Äôs likely to vindicate overtures that the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has made to the president and might overshadow a setback in local elections last week.</p>

          <p>The House is voting on a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill, introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. Democrats have criticized the effort as a waste of taxpayer dollars, while Republican Rep. Don Bacon has called it "juvenile." The White House has restricted Associated Press reporters' access to events over the news organization's decision to refer to the Gulf by its original name.</p>

          <p>A financial advisor warns against using buy now, pay later (BNPL) services for groceries, citing that it turns recurring expenses into future debt. BNPL can encourage overspending, fragment budgets, and obscure true cash flow, with frequent use potentially hurting credit scores. While BNPL services advertise zero percent interest, late fees and overdraft charges can destabilize finances. Instead, consumers should prioritize budgeting, use cash-back debit cards, and explore local food co-ops to manage grocery expenses.</p>

          <p>The article examines the historical tension between espionage and American ideals, questioning whether spying is compatible with a nation that values honesty and transparency. It traces the evolution of American intelligence from George Washington's use of spies during the Revolutionary War to the establishment of the CIA and its covert operations during the Cold War. The author explores the ethical implications of CIA excesses, such as coups and assassinations, and the challenges of maintaining accountability in a surveillance state. It also discusses the potential for abuse under the Trump administration, which has been critical of the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>Russia will celebrate the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany‚Äôs defeat with visiting heads of state and a show of armed might in Red Square, staged as a display of global clout, grandiose and intimidating, and a portent of eventual triumph in the war against Ukraine. The annual military parade below the walls and towers of the Kremlin is expected to be the largest since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, a commemoration the government and its cheerleaders have used to raise support for the war, conflating what may be the greatest source of national pride with the far more divisive current conflict. Behind the pomp, though, Russia stands on shakier ground than the Kremlin‚Äôs confident show suggests. Its military is barely advancing on the battlefield, its economy is sputtering, prices for oil, its main export, are falling and, perhaps most surprising, President Trump is hinting that his view of President Vladimir V.

          <p>The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% due to a slowdown in inflation, but warned of unpredictability in the global economy. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit economic growth, but concluded this would be offset by a drop in energy bills and eventually lower inflation. The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later. Future UK rate cuts are likely to be gradual and careful, as minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided.</p>
