          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on the golf course at his Turnberry resort amid a significant police presence. His trip is not solely for leisure, as he is scheduled to hold critical discussions with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding a potential transatlantic trade deal, which he has given a 50-50 chance of success. The visit also includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney to discuss trade and international issues. The event has drawn both small groups of his supporters and larger protests against his visit in other Scottish cities.</p>

          <p>Firefighters across Greece are contending with five major wildfires as the nation endures a severe and prolonged heatwave, with temperatures predicted to hit 44°C (111.2°F). The most significant efforts are focused on blazes on the islands of Kythira and Evia, where high winds and scorching heat continue to fuel the flames, causing property damage and forcing evacuations. The situation remains extremely dangerous, with officials reporting injuries to firefighters and requesting additional firefighting aircraft from the European Union. Neighboring Turkey has also reported its highest-ever temperature as fires rage in several of its own regions.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the urgent humanitarian situation in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland. The discussion is expected to focus on accelerating efforts to establish a ceasefire and deliver more aid, as relief agencies warn of mass starvation in the territory. This meeting occurs as Israel faces growing international pressure over the conflict, which has resulted in at least 59,676 Palestinian deaths according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Starmer is also facing domestic calls to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move several other European nations have recently committed to.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States has deep and controversial roots, originating not as a reward for good service but as a system to avoid paying fair wages. This article explains that the custom became widespread after the Civil War, allowing employers to hire newly freed Black workers without providing them a real wage, instead suggesting customers pay a small gratuity. This history led to the creation of the subminimum wage for tipped workers, which under federal law is just $2.13 an hour, a figure that has not changed since 1991. Consequently, customer tips are not just a bonus but are essential for service workers to reach the standard federal minimum wage.</p>

          <p>Citing security concerns, Russia significantly scaled down its annual Navy Day celebrations, canceling traditional warship parades in major ports like St. Petersburg. The decision reflects Moscow's growing vulnerability to Ukraine's expansive drone campaign, which has successfully targeted Russian warships and airbases deep within its territory. Overnight, Russian air defenses reportedly downed 99 Ukrainian drones across several regions, and dozens of flights were suspended at St. Petersburg's airport. Despite the reduced festivities, President Vladimir Putin vowed to expand the navy's combat capability, while Ukrainian drone and missile strikes continued to hit cities in Ukraine's northeast.</p>

          <p>Beijing has sharply criticized a failed recall vote in Taiwan, labeling the effort as a form of "political manipulation" that goes against the will of the island's people. The vote, backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), unsuccessfully targeted 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT). A spokesperson for mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused the DPP of provoking political strife and attempting to suppress dissent to create a one-party monopoly. This statement reflects the ongoing tense relationship, as Beijing continues to exert political and military pressure on Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine has reportedly pivoted from campaign rhetoric to a more tactical strategy, marked by a direct ultimatum to Vladimir Putin. The new approach involves threatening significant international sanctions on Russia's oil sales unless it engages in good-faith peace negotiations with Ukraine, a move that also includes selling top U.S. arms to NATO allies to supply to Kyiv. While some supporters praise this as a decisive policy shift, others within the Republican party remain opposed to further involvement. Security experts suggest this strategy could be effective but may take years to yield a resolution to the conflict.</p>

Crockett advocates for a fiercer communication strategy, arguing Democrats should meet the GOP's aggressive tactics with equal force to energize the party's base. However, her approach has caused friction within her own party, with some colleagues worrying her rhetoric could alienate moderate voters and viewing her as undisciplined.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinkholes are becoming more frequent globally, and research suggests climate change is a significant contributing factor by intensifying extreme weather patterns. Droughts lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, and subsequent heavy rainfall adds sudden weight that can cause the ground to collapse. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in regions with soluble bedrock, known as karst terrain, such as Florida, Turkey, and parts of China. In Turkey's Konya Plain, for example, the number of sinkholes has dramatically increased as drought and excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture have depleted underground water levels, increasing risks for populated areas.</p>

The authors cite historical examples, such as 19th-century race science, and contemporary research on animal behavior to show how dominant cultural and political values have always shaped scientific inquiry. They contend that in the current political climate, scientists must confront this reality and integrate political analysis into their work. This would create a more honest, rigorous, and resilient science capable of serving humanity rather than enabling oppressive systems.</p>

          <p>China has announced the discovery of a super-large zirconium deposit, a critical mineral for advanced aerospace and defense applications, including hypersonic weapons. The newly identified resource, found in a non-marine basin, is estimated to contain 2 million tonnes of zirconium dioxide, which would increase the nation's total reserves by a factor of five. Zirconium alloys are essential for manufacturing components that can withstand extreme heat, such as scramjet combustion chambers and nose cones. This significant find could bolster China's strategic independence and capabilities in the ongoing global competition to develop next-generation military technology.</p>

          <p>In response to a Republican effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps for partisan advantage, California's Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to retaliate by gerrymandering his state's own districts. This article presents a debate between two columnists on the wisdom of such a move, which would override California's independent redistricting commission. One argues it is a dangerous tactic that ignores the will of voters and could backfire, while the other contends it may be a necessary form of "peaceful resistance" to protect democracy from authoritarianism. The discussion weighs short-term political gains against long-term principles and the potential for escalating partisan warfare over electoral maps.</p>

          <p>President Trump's hardline immigration policies have profoundly transformed the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to a dramatic drop in migrant crossings and altering the region's social and economic fabric. An asylum ban, mass deportations, and border militarization have created a climate of fear, prompting some migrants already in the U.S. to "self-deport" to Mexico. In border cities like Ciudad Juárez, migrant shelters are emptying while factories that rely on cross-border trade are laying off thousands due to tariff uncertainty. The report paints a picture of a region in flux, where hope for migrants has dwindled and economic stability for residents on both sides is precarious.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws a parallel between the modern term "Alligator Alcatraz" for a Florida migrant detention center and the historical racist trope of using Black babies as "alligator bait." The author argues that both phrases serve to dehumanize their targets, using dark humor to mask cruelty and justify violence by framing vulnerable people as worthless or criminal. The article contends that this dehumanizing language manufactures public consent for suffering and state-sanctioned cruelty, whether against formerly enslaved people or modern immigrants. It concludes that remembering this painful history is crucial to recognizing how such coded language continues to be used to target and mock the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A personal travelogue humorously details a journey on Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn, highlighting the system's notorious lack of punctuality and reliability. The author recounts a trip to the North Sea island of Föhr that was beset by unexpected train changes, staff shortages, and a bizarre delay caused by a flock of sheep on the tracks. The experience serves as a critique of Germany's underfunded and aging rail infrastructure, where only 62% of trains run on time. The article suggests that such travel woes have become an accepted, albeit frustrating, part of life in one of the world's leading industrial nations.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, Poland was the only team from Eastern Europe to qualify for Euro 2025, highlighting a significant regional disparity. This article explores the reasons behind this gap, citing a combination of historical, societal, and financial factors. Experts point to a lack of investment, infrastructure, and a cultural bias that has traditionally discouraged girls from playing football. While UEFA initiatives and increased budgets are beginning to show positive results, the legacy of post-communist economic struggles and the rise of conservative social values continue to pose challenges for the growth of the women's game in the region.</p>

          <p>Residents in Gaza have responded with cautious optimism to Israel's announcement of a temporary humanitarian pause, but express deep fears that it will not be enough to end the starvation crisis. For months, the population has faced severe shortages of food, water, and medicine, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting 133 deaths from malnutrition. While any aid is welcome, many Gazans emphasize the need for a permanent end to the war and unrestricted access for relief convoys. They worry that a few symbolic aid deliveries will not solve the underlying issues, as they subsist on expired canned goods and lack fresh produce or protein.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread anxiety about the economic impact of President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets have been surging to record highs, creating a puzzling disconnect. This article explains that the rally is fueled by a resilient economy, a strong labor market, and corporate profits that have proven sturdier than expected. Furthermore, many investors have adopted a belief that the president's bark is worse than his bite, expecting that final trade deals will involve less severe tariffs than initially announced. However, significant risks remain, as the full economic impact of existing tariffs has yet to be felt and key trade negotiations are still unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>

Stewart delivered a blistering monologue on 'The Daily Show', while 'South Park' launched its new season with a savage satire of President Trump and Paramount's actions.

According to analysts, Sweden's reputation for international trust and its role in fostering dialogue make it an ideal location.

The festival, billed as the world's first hydrogen-powered music event, unraveled when staff were not paid and suppliers grew suspicious.
