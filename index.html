          <p>A 19-year-old Michigan man, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, was arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting at a U.S. military base in Warren, Michigan, on behalf of ISIS. Said reportedly shared his plans with undercover officers, provided ammunition and magazines, surveilled the base with a drone, and trained the officers on firearms and Molotov cocktails. He was arrested on the scheduled day of the attack after launching a drone near the base. If convicted, Said faces up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced plans to ease prison overcrowding in the UK, including limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Under the new measures, offenders recalled for license breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period, bypassing lengthy parole board assessments. Mahmood warned that building new prisons alone would not solve the crisis, and that the change would not apply to those who commit serious further offenses or are deemed a high risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times article reports that new tariffs have taken effect on shipments arriving in the United States from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800, potentially facing tariffs of 54 percent. This is a result of President Trump closing a longstanding loophole that allowed inexpensive Chinese goods to be mailed to the U.S. without import duties. The change is expected to impact American shoppers and disrupt global trade, with Chinese factory owners reporting fewer orders due to higher prices, potentially leading to business closures and job losses. The United States and China have agreed to reduce their respective tariffs for 90 days while they continue negotiations, ending a standoff that had brought to a halt much of the trade between the world’s two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Nissan is planning to cut approximately 15% of its global workforce, or about 20,000 employees, after reporting a significant loss for the fiscal year due to declining sales and restructuring costs. The Japanese automaker intends to reduce the number of its auto plants from 17 to 10 as part of its recovery plan, which aims to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business. CEO Ivan Espinosa emphasized the challenges ahead, stating that the company faces a "mountain to climb" and aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes in northern Gaza resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians, including children, according to Palestinian health officials. This comes as Israel threatens to intensify its military campaign in the region despite growing international pressure. The Trump administration has been attempting to broker an end to the ongoing 18-month war, which has resulted in over 50,000 deaths and brought Gaza to the brink of starvation. Prime Minister Netanyahu has threatened further escalation unless Hamas disarms and releases remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>California's insurance regulator has approved State Farm's request for a 17% premium increase for homeowners to help rebuild its capital following the Los Angeles wildfires. State Farm argued that the increase is necessary to avoid a financial crisis that could force it to drop more California policies. The decision comes as California works to retain insurers in the state amidst increasing wildfire risks. The new rates will take effect in June, and in exchange, State Farm will receive a $400m cash infusion from its parent company and agree to halt some non-renewals through the end of this year.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of former federal employees are facing job losses, leading to yard sales, moves, and financial instability.

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths dropped sharply in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded. Provisional data from the CDC estimates that 80,000 people died from overdoses last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money.
