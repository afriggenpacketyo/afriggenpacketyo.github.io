          <p>The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While no specific threats are noted, the bulletin cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized the need to keep the nation safe and informed during the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, which could motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators. Law enforcement in New York City is deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington is preparing for a potential response from Tehran, even as the Iranian government downplays the attacks' impact. U.S. military officials claim the strikes caused severe damage, while an Israeli official indicated a willingness to suspend hostilities if Iran ceases missile attacks on Israel. Concerns remain about Iran's potential military actions against U.S. interests and the possibility of further nuclear development. Despite the strikes, few in Washington desire a prolonged conflict, with Vice President JD Vance stating the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not Iran itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. carried out a bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, with the Pentagon reporting "extremely severe damage" to all sites. Israel coordinated fully with the U.S. in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials confirmed the attacks but denied any major impact. Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, which dropped 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators on the Fordo nuclear site. Iranian officials have stated that they will retaliate for the attacks, with potential responses ranging from diplomatic negotiations to military actions against U.S. bases in the Middle East.</p>

The groom and the 13-year-old, believed to be the couple's son, sustained serious injuries, and the attackers fled on foot after the incident.

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen regarding potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial global trade route that connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that any attempt by Iran to block the strait would be a "suicidal move," likely triggering a strong international response.

          <p>The conflict between the US and Iran has brought renewed focus on the Strait of Hormuz, a key waterway between Oman and Iran, which connects the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint." Iran is reportedly considering blocking the strait after the US strikes on its nuclear sites. Large volumes of crude extracted by OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq from oil fields across the Persian Gulf region and consumed globally flow through the strait.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the Pentagon briefing provided details on the military operation but lacked clarity on future actions. The briefing laid out the details of the military deception plan behind Operation Midnight Hammer, in which B-2 stealth aircraft were flown west towards the Pacific as a decoy, while the B-2s with bunker-busting bombs on board flew east towards Iran. The U.S. defense secretary emphasized that this wasn't about regime change in Iran, but part of the operation was to defend Israel and the ongoing defense of Israel.</p>

          <p>JD Vance has stated that the U.S. is "not at war" with Iran, but rather with its nuclear weapons program, a position the White House hopes to maintain as Iran considers a response to the U.S. strike on its nuclear installations. Vance declined to confirm the complete destruction of Iran’s nuclear sites, but believes the U.S. has “substantially delayed” Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Satellite images showed new craters, possible collapsed tunnel entrances and holes on top of a mountain ridge, but the main support building at the facility remained undamaged.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, but warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for the regime. Rubio emphasized the U.S. mission was designed to degrade nuclear sites and that future actions depend on Iran's choices. The question of how Iran will respond has raised fears that the regime could seek to block ships from traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.</p>

          <p>A staggering 16 billion login credentials, including usernames, emails, and passwords for major platforms like Apple, Google, and Facebook, have been leaked online. This breach, dubbed the "mother of all data breaches," poses significant security risks, as the compromised data includes credentials of government officials. The data was scraped from over 30 databases since the start of 2025 and likely stems from malicious “infostealer” software designed to extract sensitive information from victims’ devices. Cybersecurity experts urge users to change passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and monitor financial accounts closely to protect against cybercrimes.</p>

          <p>A suicide bombing at a church on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, has resulted in at least 20 fatalities and 52 injuries, according to Syrian authorities. The attacker entered Mar Elias Church in Dweila during a service and opened fire with a weapon before detonating an explosive vest. The interior ministry has attributed the attack to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), although there was no immediate claim from the group itself. The Syrian Civil Defence posted images of the heavily damaged altar, pews covered in broken glass, and a bloodied floor.</p>

          <p>Recent incidents involving masked ICE agents in New York and California highlight a growing concern about federal agents concealing their identities. The practice of agents wearing masks during arrests and enforcement actions undermines their authority and can create a cover for violating constitutional and civil rights. While there is no specific federal policy prohibiting masks, Department of Homeland Security regulations require agents to identify themselves during arrests. Critics argue that masked agents can confuse bystanders and targets, potentially leading to interference in law enforcement actions and increasing the risk of impersonation and abuse.</p>

          <p>Following military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. officials have urged Iran to embrace a diplomatic off-ramp rather than retaliate. President Trump stated that Iran must now make peace or face greater tragedy, while Vice President Vance suggested the U.S. was not interested in a broader war. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized that the strikes were intentionally limited to the nuclear program and called for Iran to come forward for peace. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said it was irrelevant to ask Iran to return to diplomacy because they were already engaged in talks when the strikes occurred.</p>

The earliest record of the claim appeared to originate from an X post by the account Tehran Updates, which is not affiliated with any government entity.
