          <p>A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the fatal stabbing of Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at a British school, amidst rising concerns about knife crime in the UK. The accused denied a murder charge, setting the stage for a trial to determine the extent of his culpability. Willgoose's parents have since become advocates against knife violence and hope to establish a youth center in their son's honor. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described knife crime as a national crisis, prompting the government to implement measures such as banning certain types of weapons and imposing stricter penalties on tech platforms hosting harmful content.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has begun adding substantial "import charges," sometimes exceeding 145%, in response to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. These fees, which can more than double the price of items, are attributed to covering customs-related processes and costs. This move follows warnings from Temu and Shein about impending price increases due to the tariffs and the end of a de minimis exemption that previously allowed duty-free entry for low-value packages. The increased costs may impact Temu's popularity by eroding its competitive pricing advantage against U.S. retailers.</p>

These orders will direct federal agencies to publish a list of jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws and "unleash America's law enforcement to pursue criminals". This action comes as the administration faces legal challenges in its efforts to penalize sanctuary cities, with a federal judge blocking attempts to withhold federal funds from municipalities limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued an unprecedented number of executive orders during his second term, surpassing previous records and signaling a shift in power towards the executive branch. Experts suggest this trend reflects a clear set of priorities and a move away from legislative branches, indicating an increased assumption of lawmaking authority by the executive. The Trump administration's ability to advance numerous executive orders is attributed to extensive planning during its time out of office. However, this approach places strain on the judicial branch, with numerous lawsuits challenging the orders.</p>

These actions have sparked fears of a crackdown on vulnerable children and concerns about "backdoor family separation."

          <p>As Canadians headed to the polls for a snap election, US President Donald Trump renewed his calls for Canada to become the US's 51st state. The statements by President Trump have played a role during the campaign, with Canadian Prime Minister Carney and his challenger Poilievre rejecting the idea. Carney's Liberals entered election day leading in the latest opinion polls, with Conservative Poilievre's populist campaign and its similarities to the US President potentially costing him the election.</p>

          <p>Settling a debt typically won't improve your credit score in the short term and may initially lower it, as it's viewed less favorably than paying the full amount.

Over time, as the settled debt ages and good financial habits are maintained, your credit score can recover.

          <p>The FA Cup semi-final between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City saw lower-than-expected attendance, raising questions about ticket sales and fan interest.
