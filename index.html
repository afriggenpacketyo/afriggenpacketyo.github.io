          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges for her role in the death of actor Matthew Perry. She admitted to providing the ketamine that led to his fatal overdose in October 2023. Sangha is the fifth and final defendant charged in the case to accept a plea deal, avoiding a trial. The investigation followed Perry's death from the acute effects of the drug, which he was found to have obtained outside of his therapeutic treatments.</p>

          <p>A contentious penalty decision awarded to Leeds in their 1-0 victory over Everton has sparked debate over the Premier League's handball rule. The spot-kick was given after a shot struck Everton defender James Tarkowski's arm, which was positioned close to his body. Pundits, players, and managers expressed divided opinions and confusion over the law, which hinges on whether a player's body has been made "unnaturally bigger." The incident highlights the ongoing ambiguity and controversy surrounding handball interpretations in modern football.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, the virologist who discovered the coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, has issued a stark warning that the next pandemic is inevitable. He stated that the world may not be any better prepared than it was for COVID-19 and expressed particular concern about new respiratory viruses jumping from animals to humans. Peiris emphasized the need for a more integrated approach to global health to prevent future pandemics from being as destructive as previous ones.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle that sped away from an immigration stop in San Bernardino County, California. Officials stated the driver struck two agents while fleeing, prompting the agent to fire in self-defense, though video of the incident does not show the agents being hit. The event highlights the escalating tensions surrounding federal immigration enforcement tactics in California, a state with policies that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal agents.</p>

The Democrats' departure broke the legislature's quorum, but they now claim victory in having raised national awareness about the fight against gerrymandering. Their return allows the legislative process to resume, setting the stage for a renewed battle over the new voting maps, which are expected to favor Republicans in the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>During a high-stakes meeting at the White House, top European leaders pressed President Trump to demand a ceasefire from Russia as a critical precondition for advancing peace negotiations with Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron were adamant that further talks would be unimaginable without an immediate halt to the fighting. The unified European stance was presented amid concerns that Trump might be softening his position on Russia following his recent summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>A group of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's Justice Department over a new rule tying federal crime victim grants to immigration enforcement cooperation. The lawsuit argues that this condition is illegal, as it forces states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for victim services or helping enforce federal immigration law. This legal action represents the latest clash between the administration and so-called "sanctuary states" over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump shifted his position on the war in Ukraine, telling President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a White House meeting that a ceasefire is not a prerequisite for a peace deal with Russia. This marks a reversal from his previous stance and came as a surprise to European allies present, who continued to advocate for a ceasefire as an essential first step. The change followed Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, fueling concerns that the U.S. president is becoming more aligned with Russia's negotiating position.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to fundamentally change U.S. election procedures, vowing to eliminate mail-in voting and voting machines through executive action. However, the U.S. Constitution grants authority over the time, place, and manner of elections to the states and Congress, not the presidency. Trump's pledge was accompanied by repeated, widely debunked falsehoods about widespread voter fraud, signaling his continued focus on altering election laws ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price experienced a significant downturn, falling to around $115,000 just days after surging to a new all-time high above $124,000. The broader cryptocurrency market also tumbled, with the sell-off attributed to a wave of forced liquidations exceeding $500 million. This volatility was sparked by investor profit-taking and renewed macroeconomic concerns following higher-than-expected inflation data, which has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A common accounting practice called the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, may be distorting their profitability in the face of new tariffs. Because RIM relies on average costs across broad categories of items, it is slow to reflect sudden increases in import costs, which can lead to a temporary overstatement of gross margins. This accounting nuance is critical for understanding retailers' financial performance as they navigate the unpredictable landscape of U.S. trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
