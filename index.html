          <p>The Trump administration has authorized a $30 million grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an organization with close ties to private security contractors. The GHF has been accused of politicizing food distribution in Gaza and has received preferential access to operate in the region, claiming it can deliver aid without Hamas interference. Critics have raised concerns about chaotic rollouts, deaths near distribution centers, and close collaboration with the Israeli government. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized the support for GHF as a departure from established humanitarian organizations, and rights advocates have warned that private contractors risk complicity in international crimes. Optimism remains low as the situation is wrought with controversy and ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>A boat capsizing on Lake Tahoe resulted in eight fatalities after a 27-foot Chris-Craft boat overturned due to a large swell near D.L. Bliss State Park. The Coast Guard initially reported six adults dead, two rescued, and two missing, prompting a search that covered over 390 square miles. The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office later recovered the bodies of the missing individuals, identifying all eight victims. The incident occurred amidst abruptly changing weather conditions, with high winds and snow reported in the area. The tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the importance of boating safety and preparedness, especially given the unpredictable nature of mountain weather.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is implementing changes to its pricing structure for beverage add-ins, standardizing costs across its stores. Customers will now be charged 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce modifying an unflavored drink, but substitutions in pre-flavored drinks will remain free. Adding matcha powder to non-matcha beverages will cost $1, and dried fruit inclusions will be 50 cents. This adjustment is part of CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to enhance customer service and create a more inviting cafÃ© environment, with the company also testing real-time pricing updates in its app to improve transparency.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower complaint alleges that a top Justice Department official, Emil Bove, suggested the Trump administration should defy court orders related to immigration enforcement. The complaint, filed by a former DOJ official, Erez Reuveni, claims Bove and other officials discussed misleading courts and potentially ignoring judges' rulings regarding the Alien Enemies Act. Reuveni's allegations detail internal meetings where Bove allegedly said the department should consider saying "f--- you" to the courts. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has refuted these claims, describing Reuveni as a disgruntled former employee and stating that no one suggested a court order should not be followed.</p>

          <p>Former Biden official Neera Tanden testified before Congress as part of an investigation into President Biden's mental acuity, asserting that she had no reason to question his command as president during her time in the White House. Tanden, who previously faced criticism for her social media posts and was initially nominated to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), stated that Biden was in charge during her experience. The House Oversight Committee is probing whether those closest to Biden colluded to hide his declining mental state and circumvented him on important orders. Tanden's testimony also revealed that she was authorized to direct autopen signatures from 2021 to 2023, a system inherited from previous administrations.</p>

Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance slightly below Wall Street expectations.

However, despite the administration's claims of obliterating Iran's nuclear facilities, US military intelligence officials suggest the damage is less severe than reported, potentially setting back the program by only months.

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has moved to dismiss all active gang injunctions, impacting 317 people across multiple cities. This decision follows a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity in California. The move comes after legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased and violated the state's Racial Justice Act. Critics argue the injunctions turned everyday activities into crimes and were disproportionately applied to Latino criminal organizations. The district attorney's office may seek new injunctions under the revised definition if necessary.</p>

These jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk and can also carry conventional weapons. The decision is seen as a victory for the RAF, providing them with a longer-range fighter capable of firing a wider variety of bombs and missiles.

          <p>Five Harris Teeter stores across Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina are set to close this summer as part of a broader plan by parent company Kroger to shutter 60 locations nationwide. The closures, resulting from a strategic market review, will affect approximately 100 to 120 employees at each store, who will be offered transfer opportunities. Specific locations include stores in Raleigh, Rockville, McLean, and two in Arlington. The move reflects Kroger's efforts to streamline operations and address unprofitable stores.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a subsequent Iranian attack on an American air base in Qatar, the FBI is intensifying its focus on counterterrorism threats, both domestically and abroad. A memo has been distributed to FBI field office directors instructing them to prioritize resources towards terror threats. This decision follows an earlier report forecasting the need to concentrate resources on Iran, including disrupting financial and logistical networks and targeting related hacking operations. The move comes amid internal complaints about agents being pulled from counterterrorism tasks to focus on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>An early intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) indicates that the recent U.S. air campaign against Iranian nuclear sites only set back Iran's nuclear enrichment program by a few months, contradicting President Trump's claim of complete obliteration. The assessment, confirmed by a U.S. official, revealed limited damage to critical infrastructure, particularly at the Fordo facility. Iranian officials have also stated their intention to continue enriching uranium, despite the strikes. The report raises concerns about the long-term effectiveness of the military action and the potential for Iran to pursue nuclear weapons.</p>

The ruling follows a previous appellate court decision that deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard.

          <p>This analysis suggests that President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, without a linked diplomatic agreement, could inadvertently increase the risk of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The author argues that Trump's focus on military strikes as a solution overlooks the need for verifiable limits on Iran's nuclear program. By not pursuing further negotiations, Iran may end cooperation with international agencies, potentially leading to covert nuclear weapon development. The piece draws parallels with North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, cautioning against a similar outcome with Iran.</p>

          <p>Rep. Kat Cammack, an anti-abortion lawmaker, shared her experience with a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy in Florida, where a six-week abortion ban caused hesitation among medical professionals to provide necessary care. Cammack said that doctors and nurses were reluctant to administer methotrexate, a drug used to treat ectopic pregnancies, due to fears of legal repercussions under the state's abortion law. Despite the law including exceptions for the life of the pregnant person, Cammack blamed the left's messaging for creating paranoia among healthcare workers, rather than the abortion ban itself.</p>
