          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including Africans and other non-Rwandan nationals. Decisions on financial compensation and other details are expected within two weeks, according to a Rwandan official. The U.S. is simultaneously trying to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised Trump's envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, for his efforts to broker billion-dollar minerals deals in the region.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is launching a startup called World that uses a device called an Orb to scan a person's retina and verify they are human, creating a digital ID to distinguish them from bots. The Orb is intended to address the issue of bots impersonating people in areas like finance and online dating. The U.S. rollout follows an international debut in 2023 that faced privacy backlash, including government shutdowns in Kenya, Hong Kong, and Spain. The Orb is designed to be used in the World App, a digital wallet for decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his first judicial nominee of his second term, Whitney Hermandorfer, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, signaling a continuation of his focus on appointing conservative judges. The article praises Trump's previous judicial appointments, including Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, and their impact on decisions such as overturning Roe v. Wade and strengthening the Second Amendment. The author anticipates Trump will look beyond traditional Federalist Society choices to install a new generation of judicial titans. Trump's judicial impact extended beyond the Supreme Court, as he appointed 54 circuit judges in his first term, second only to President Jimmy Carter’s 56 in a single term.</p>

          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of Françoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" explores the complexities of adolescence and relationships on the French Riviera. The film follows Cécile, a young girl enjoying a carefree summer with her father and his girlfriend, until the arrival of Anne, a friend of Cécile's deceased mother, disrupts their dynamic. While the movie captures the glamour of the setting, it delves deeper into the characters' motivations, sometimes over-intellectualizing the narrative. Chloë Sevigny's portrayal of Anne stands out, embodying emotional vulnerability beneath a composed exterior.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 flights a day after experiencing significant flight disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems as the primary causes for the delays, which have impacted thousands of passengers. United had previously attributed the disruptions to FAA technology outages, runway construction, and high winds, leading to numerous flight diversions. Kirby expressed disappointment in having to make further cuts but emphasized the need to protect customers given the unresolved FAA staffing issues.</p>

          <p>An article explores the concept of happiness by visiting Finland, which has consistently topped the World Happiness Report. The report is based on a single question called the Cantril Ladder, which asks people to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10. While the Nordic countries consistently rank high due to factors like long life expectancies and social cohesion, the article questions the validity of measuring happiness through a single question and explores the complexities of finding contentment in different cultures.</p>
