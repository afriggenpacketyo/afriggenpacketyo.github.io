        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate is considering a White House proposal to cancel over $9 billion in previously approved funding, targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting corporations like NPR and PBS. The measure faces a tight deadline and significant opposition from some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who express concerns about its impact on global health initiatives and domestic services. Despite the House having already approved the package, dissent within the Senate GOP threatens its passage, even with a modified version that preserves funding for an AIDS prevention program.</p>

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and CUNY faced a contentious House committee hearing regarding antisemitism on their campuses. The chancellors defended their institutions' commitment to both free speech and combating discrimination, detailing disciplinary actions taken while asserting that pro-Palestinian expression is not inherently antisemitic. While Republican members criticized the universities for allegedly unchecked antisemitism and questioned faculty practices, Democrats condemned the hearing as "political theater" and a distraction from the administration's own efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence has issued a "sincere apology" after it was revealed that a major data breach in 2022 exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation. Following the leak, the government secretly established a new resettlement route that has so far brought 4,500 individuals to the UK, a fact concealed from the public by a super-injunction. A High Court judge has now lifted the gagging order, criticizing the "scrutiny vacuum" it created and bringing the £400 million covert operation to light.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted citizenship to Daniel Martindale, an American who spied for Moscow during the war in Ukraine. According to Russian state media, Martindale spent two years in Ukraine after the 2022 invasion, providing Russian intelligence with coordinates of military facilities while posing as a missionary. After being extracted in what was described as a "complex evacuation," he received his new passport in a ceremony, calling it a "dream" and stating that Russia is his "family."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have introduced two new alternate uniforms for the 2025 season, prompting a wave of reactions from fans and players. The team unveiled a striking all-gold "Charger Power" ensemble, which has been humorously compared to mustard bottles and the Savannah Bananas baseball team. Additionally, a "Super Chargers" uniform featuring navy blue jerseys, pants, and helmets will serve as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance.</p>

This aggressive military posture, which has reportedly led to a significant increase in civilian casualties in Yemen, raises questions about whether the administration's strategy to end "forever wars" involves using overwhelming firepower to preemptively stop conflicts.</p>

          <p>Bradley Murdoch, the man convicted of the infamous 2001 murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback, has died from throat cancer at age 67. Murdoch was serving a life sentence but never revealed the location of Falconio's body, an act of silence that denied the victim's family closure. The case also involved the attempted kidnapping of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape. Northern Territory Police expressed regret that Murdoch died without providing this crucial information, though a substantial reward for finding the remains is still active.</p>

          <p>A Tampa, Florida woman named Irena Green spent six days in jail after a dispute with her homeowners association (HOA) escalated to a contempt of court charge. The conflict began with violation notices for her lawn's condition and other minor issues, leading to a court case where a judge ordered her to fix the problems or face jail time. After she missed a subsequent court date, which she claims she was not notified of, a warrant was issued for her arrest, highlighting how seemingly minor conflicts with powerful HOAs can lead to severe consequences.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King, one half of the Hairy Bikers, has made his first visit to the site of the Sycamore Gap tree since it was illegally felled in September 2023. King, who is from the region, described his devastation as a "visceral reaction" and had avoided the site until now, calling the act of vandalism "mindless" and "personal." The beloved tree was a cherished landmark and a place of solace for many, including King, who said he would have visited it to reflect on the recent loss of his friend and co-star, Dave Myers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The BMA, the doctors' union, supports the changes but believes the review should have gone further to address concerns about the roles being used to fill doctor shortages without appropriate oversight.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The project will address the toll that the hot, humid indoor conditions have taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The ambitious plan involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and upgrading the heating system to make the iconic Victorian glasshouse a net-zero emissions building, ensuring its preservation for future generations.</p>

The ASA found that the claims about its ingredients, which include CBD and ashwagandha, were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food and drink products.</p>

He described the subsequent years of political turmoil as a "pretty disastrous period" for the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming the California Democrat misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff, a long-time political adversary who led Trump's first impeachment, dismissed the allegation as "baseless political retribution" and an attempt to distract from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. A memo from Fannie Mae investigators cited by Trump noted a "possible occupancy misrepresentation" but did not use the word "fraud" or conclude a crime was committed.</p>

In a surprise defeat for the crypto industry and a rare rebuke of President Trump's direction, 13 Republicans joined Democrats in voting against the rule for debate, blocking the legislation from moving forward. The failure of the vote during the much-touted "Crypto Week" sent crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase and Circle lower, leaving the future of the legislative package uncertain.
