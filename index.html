          <p>China's coastguard has seized a tiny sandbank in the South China Sea, escalating its territorial dispute with the Philippines, according to state media reports. The move occurred near a Philippine military outpost on Thitu Island. The Philippines responded by landing on three sandbanks and mimicking China's flag-raising photo. The White House has expressed deep concern over China's actions, warning that they threaten regional stability and violate international law, while the US and Philippine forces conduct joint war drills.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration will decide this week whether to continue pursuing a negotiated settlement in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or to turn its attention to other matters.
