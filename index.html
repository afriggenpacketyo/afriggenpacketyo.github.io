          <h2>Trump Deploys National Guard to Los Angeles Amid Immigration Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 01:14:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, bypassing California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority. The deployment is based on a federal law allowing the president to federalize National Guard troops under specific circumstances, such as invasion, rebellion, or inability to execute federal laws. Legal experts note the move raises concerns about the troops' role and potential use of force, as they are intended to support immigration officers, not engage in direct law enforcement activities. This action follows Trump's previous threats to use the military to suppress violence in cities and states, signaling a willingness to deploy federal force on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, returned to work part-time after having a baby and believes that offering flexible working options for teachers is key to addressing recruitment and retention issues. Government data suggests that while the overall number of teachers has fallen slightly, there are more teachers in secondary and special schools compared to last year. Computer science teacher Sam Alner notes the relentless nature of teaching and the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance, especially in disadvantaged areas where recruitment is difficult. The government aims to recruit 6,500 new teachers, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson advocating for more schools to offer flexible hours.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's alleged self-enrichment and the flow of foreign money into his businesses pose a fundamental danger to the U.S. political system. The author draws parallels to Vladimir Putin's Russia and Viktor Orban's Hungary, where leaders have allegedly used their power to benefit themselves and their associates. The piece warns that the U.S. is at risk of becoming another country where the leader's personal interests are indistinguishable from the nation's interests. The author emphasizes the erosion of checks and balances and the capture of the justice system by loyalists as key indicators of this shift.</p>

          <p>Italians are voting on referendums to ease citizenship requirements for children born in Italy to foreign parents and to provide greater job protections. Supporters argue the citizenship reform would integrate second-generation Italians and align Italy with other European countries. Premier Giorgia Meloni's decision to abstain from voting has drawn criticism, with some accusing the government of trying to dampen interest in the measures. Opinion polls indicate low public awareness and turnout projections, raising concerns about the referendums' validity due to the required quorum.</p>

Tellurium, a rare element produced as a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The confusion likely arose due to the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the markings on REAL ID-compliant cards. The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 to establish standards for identification sources following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China is facing a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, making the decline in fertility rates especially urgent. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, can be a socially acceptable disguise for disordered eating behaviors. While intermittent fasting is often touted for its benefits, such as weight loss and improved metabolic health, it can be problematic for individuals with a history of eating disorders. The restrictive nature of scheduled fasting can hide disordered eating without raising concern and may even be praised, reinforcing harmful behaviors. Experts emphasize the importance of mindset and intent when considering intermittent fasting, as it can easily trigger obsessive thoughts about food and body image.</p>

Some venture capitalists have been pushing for a culture of overwork to compete on a global stage, but founders argue that it's a myth and leads to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent. They insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to position themselves as key players in the global startup scene. The younger generation is less likely to put up with overworking and tends to prioritize work-life balance.</p>
