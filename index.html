          <p>A significant wildfire in New Jersey has consumed over 13,000 acres and is only 50% contained, prompting air quality alerts extending into the New York City area. The Jones Road Fire in Ocean County is expected to expand due to dry conditions and winds, posing a threat to sensitive groups in affected regions. While not anticipated to be as severe as the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke, officials caution residents to remain vigilant as winds could shift and bring smoke back into the area. Firefighters are working diligently to control the blaze and mitigate its impact on air quality and public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Merck has revised its full-year profit outlook downward, citing an estimated $200 million impact from tariffs and a charge related to a recent licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma. Despite this, the company's first-quarter revenue and profit exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in its oncology portfolio and animal health products. Merck also highlighted significant sales contributions from newly launched drugs like Winrevair and Capvaxive, which are crucial for offsetting future losses from its top-selling cancer therapy Keytruda. The expected tariff charge primarily reflects levies between the U.S. and China, and Canada and Mexico to a lesser degree.</p>

          <p>Comcast is set to release its first-quarter earnings report, with investors closely monitoring updates on the company's broadband and mobile businesses. Broadband customer growth has slowed due to increased competition, prompting Comcast to shift its focus towards expanding its mobile services.

          <p>Democrats are divided over how to respond to President Trump's immigration policies, specifically the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant deported to El Salvador. Some Democrats advocate for highlighting the lawless cruelty of the situation, while others fear it will play into Trump's strengths on immigration. The Supreme Court has ordered Trump to facilitate Abrego Garciaâ€™s return to the United States, but the White House refuses to comply. A key concern is that focusing on immigration could detract from the party's message on Trump's handling of trade and the economy, where he is more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has revised its earnings forecast for the year, citing anticipated volatility in global trade, new tariffs, and a cautious consumer environment. Despite reporting mixed quarterly results with international sales partially offsetting weaker North American demand, the company's CEO, Ramon Laguarta, expressed concerns about increasing supply chain costs and subdued consumer conditions. The company is implementing strategies to improve its North American performance, where both food and beverage volumes have declined. For the full year, PepsiCo now expects core constant currency earnings per share to remain roughly unchanged, a revision from its previous projection of mid-single-digit growth.</p>

The meeting also takes place as Ukraine's relationship with the US has become strained under President Trump.

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is evaluating the potential implementation of regional energy pricing in the UK, which could offer discounts to households located near energy infrastructure. While dismissing reports of an imminent "postcode lottery" that would significantly raise bills for southern England, Miliband confirmed the government is exploring reforms to the energy market. Such a scheme could align power costs with local supply and demand, potentially lowering bills in areas with high renewable energy generation like Scotland. The reform is controversial, with concerns that some Britons could end up paying more for their energy.</p>
