The spacecraft rotated 90 degrees while in orbit to capture the image, which focuses on Arsia Mons, roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa.

          <p>The escalating feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has sparked concerns among lawmakers and Republicans about potential divisions within the GOP ahead of the midterm elections. Musk's criticisms of Trump's "big, beautiful bill" grew more pointed, leading to a public spat on social media, with Musk taking credit for Trump's election win and the Republican takeover of the Senate. Trump responded by saying Musk had "lost his mind," and the back-and-forth attacks have reverberated across Washington. Some Republicans worry that Musk's departure from Trump's orbit could create uncertainties for the party, while others believe the two men will eventually resolve their dispute.</p>

          <p>Cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman recommends oatmeal as a go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart. He suggests preparing a cup of oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it low in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for extra fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal contains minerals, vitamins, and beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that can help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. Dr. Freeman advises avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has stated that Elon Musk is making a "huge mistake" by attacking Donald Trump in a series of social media posts, following a falling-out between the two men. Vance attempted to downplay Musk's attacks as the actions of an "emotional guy" who became frustrated, expressing hope that Musk would eventually "come back into the fold." Musk's attacks on Trump included criticizing the president's tax cuts and spending bill, suggesting Trump should be impeached, and claiming the government was concealing information about Trump's association with Jeffrey Epstein; Vance defended Trump and the bill.</p>
