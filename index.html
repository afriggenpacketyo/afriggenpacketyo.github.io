          <p>Manchester City and Chelsea are set to earn substantial sums from their participation in the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, with tens of millions secured just for qualifying. The total prize money for the tournament winner could reach approximately ¬£92 million, a figure that rivals or exceeds earnings from other major competitions like the Champions League. This massive prize pot has sparked debate, with some critics fearing it will distort the financial balance of domestic leagues by providing enormous windfalls to participating clubs.</p>

Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond portfolio is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto essential for long-term growth.

          <p>As heatwaves sweep across the U.S., medical experts are highlighting the detrimental effects of extreme temperatures on cognitive and mental health. High heat can lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and aggression, while also impairing memory, attention, and reaction time. Physically, it can cause inflammation and weaken the blood-brain barrier, potentially worsening neurological conditions. To protect brain health, experts recommend staying hydrated, avoiding peak heat hours, and using cooling methods to maintain the body's internal balance.</p>

Temperatures are expected to climb into the 30s Celsius over the weekend, potentially reaching a new high for the year on Monday. The heatwave, defined as three consecutive days above a regional temperature threshold, is expected to last four to six days. Health officials warn that the heat could affect the entire population, with the elderly and vulnerable at particular risk.</p>

          <p>Brentford has rejected a second, improved offer from Manchester United for forward Bryan Mbeumo, this time valued at ¬£55 million plus ¬£7.5 million in add-ons. United is seeking to bolster its attack, but Brentford is reportedly holding out for a larger upfront fee for the 25-year-old Cameroon international, who scored 20 goals last season. With a year remaining on his contract, Mbeumo is also attracting interest from other top clubs, potentially complicating United's pursuit of the player.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Supreme Court's recent decision to curb nationwide injunctions suggests it significantly strengthens the power of the presidency at the expense of judicial oversight. While the legal debate over judicial power is long-standing, the context of the Trump administration's actions has heightened concerns that this ruling removes a critical guardrail against potential executive overreach. The decision allows the president to more freely implement sweeping policies, leaving the courts, which have been a primary check on authoritarian impulses, with diminished ability to intervene effectively.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that approximately 56 million American workers, about half of the private-sector workforce, do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k). This lack of access creates a significant barrier to building wealth for retirement, as research shows automatic payroll deductions dramatically increase savings rates. The findings highlight a widening gap between retirement 'haves' and 'have-nots,' with millions approaching old age reliant almost entirely on a strained Social Security system.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has officially renamed the USNS Harvey Milk, stripping the name of the pioneering gay civil rights leader from the naval vessel as part of a broader Trump administration effort to remove so-called "woke" influences. The ship will now be called the USNS Oscar V. Peterson, after a Medal of Honor recipient from World War II. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the change was to remove politics from ship naming, while the Navy is also reviewing other vessels named after women and minority civil rights figures.</p>
