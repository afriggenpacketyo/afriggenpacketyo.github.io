        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent investigation confirmed that Parisian cafes often overcharge tourists, a practice the author, a former waitress in the city, is familiar with. She recounts her own experiences on both sides of the transaction, from being overcharged as a visitor to upselling as an employee. The article provides practical advice for travelers to avoid these "tourist taxes," such as learning key French phrases for ordering, carefully checking the bill, and being wary of deals that seem too good to be true. This commentary offers a personal perspective on a common travel issue in the French capital.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, leaving six in critical condition and five in serious condition. The Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office reported that the attack appeared to be random and began near the store's checkout area. A deputy arrived within three minutes of the 911 call and, with assistance from citizens, took the suspect into custody. Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, have condemned the incident as a "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is assisting with the investigation.</p>

          <p>A review of UK Sunday newspaper headlines reveals several key stories dominating the news cycle. The Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph both lead with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's planned meeting with Donald Trump, focusing on discussions about a Gaza ceasefire, Ukraine, and trade. Other major topics include widespread support for the England Lionesses in the Euro 2025 final and a Mail on Sunday claim that Ghislaine Maxwell was questioned about Prince Andrew.

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. Authorities allege the children, some of whom were adopted, were kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, beaten, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. An investigation began after a church member reported concerns, revealing that the adopted children were treated unfairly compared to the biological children. All nine children have since been removed from the home and are in protective custody.</p>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has stirred diplomatic sensitivities by calling for a more assertive presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region. The kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae are a point of historical contention, with both China and Korea claiming them as part of their heritage. The official's comments, urging scholars to clearly present this history from a Chinese perspective, touch upon a long-standing and delicate issue. This renewed focus on the contested history raises the specter of friction in China-South Korea relations.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly censoring news about mass attacks, such as stabbings or vehicle rammings, in an effort to prevent unrest and copycat crimes. This article details how reports of recent incidents, including one where a car struck children near a Beijing school, are quickly scrubbed from the internet. In response, some Chinese citizens are complaining on social media platforms like Weibo, demanding transparency and the truth about these events. This trend highlights the tension between the Communist Party's expanding information control under Xi Jinping and a public desire for basic information.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly escalates the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, with RSF commander Hemedti as president, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development follows an agreement between the RSF and other rebel and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular "New Sudan." UN officials warn this action risks further fragmenting the war-torn country and undermining diplomatic peace efforts.</p>

          <p>After a highly publicized trial, former ballerina Ashley Benefield was found guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their child, while the defense claimed she acted in self-defense after years of abuse. The trial featured emotional testimony from both Ashley and Doug's daughter from a previous marriage, as well as evidence of their turbulent relationship. The jury's verdict of manslaughter, a lesser charge than the original second-degree murder, suggests they did not believe the killing was premeditated.</p>

They argue that the focus on this method diverts attention from the real solution: opening land crossings for aid convoys.

          <p>An advertisement for the brand Guess in the latest print edition of Vogue has generated significant controversy by featuring a model created entirely with artificial intelligence.

Critics and models argue the move promotes unrealistic and narrow beauty standards, undermining years of progress toward diversity in the industry. The incident has sparked a debate about the ethical implications of using flawless, non-human models and the potential impact on consumers' mental health.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China is working to reconstruct the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, but its existence and functionality have been debated by modern scholars. Using modern scientific principles and new clues, the team hopes to build a working model of this ancient wonder. Their goal is to restore the seismoscope's reputation and validate the advanced scientific achievements of ancient China.</p>
