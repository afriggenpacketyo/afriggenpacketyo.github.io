          <p>Hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones predicts that the stock market will reach new lows even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones argues that Trump's focus on tariffs combined with the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates will negatively impact the stock market. He estimates that even with a reduction in tariffs, the economic impact would be similar to a significant tax increase, potentially reducing economic growth by 2% to 3%.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been advocating for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the Fed is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its May 7 meeting. The U.S. economy is currently sending mixed signals, with GDP falling into negative territory in the first quarter, while job growth exceeded forecasts in April. Economists predict that the Fed will likely maintain its current rate range of 4.25% to 4.5% and wait for more economic data before making any changes, with potential rate cuts possibly occurring later in the year.

The country aims to decrease the proportion of grain in animal feed to 60% and soybean meal to 10% by 2030. This initiative is part of a broader effort to minimize grain losses and ensure a stable supply of staple crops, driven by concerns over increasing meat demand and the soybean trade becoming a point of contention in trade relations.</p>

Economic concerns and stricter immigration policies are contributing factors, with some experts citing fear around immigration enforcement. This decline is notable because Hispanic Americans typically spend more on consumer packaged goods than non-Hispanic consumers. Constellation Brands, for example, noted that social gatherings, where Hispanic consumers often consume beer, are declining, while Coca-Cola experienced weaker traffic due to false rumors and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor beat Wall Street's first-quarter expectations but suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. The automaker plans to offset $1 billion of these costs, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford cited potential supply chain disruptions and future tariffs as reasons for pulling its guidance, as the automotive industry grapples with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts.</p>

          <p>U.S. exports are declining across most ports, with the agricultural sector particularly hard hit by Trump's tariffs. The latest trade data shows significant decreases in exports from ports like Oregon, Tacoma, Los Angeles, and Savannah. This slump is linked to a decrease in containership arrivals and order cancellations, leading to excess capacity in the supply chain. The decline in exports is linked to the decline in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses across the economy cancel manufacturing orders, sending Chinese factories and freight ships into retreat, as well as changes in global demand linked to U.S. trade policy.</p>
