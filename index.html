          <p>A feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has sparked concerns among Republicans about potential divisions within the party. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and social media posts have led to a public spat, causing worry about the impact on upcoming midterm elections. Some Republicans fear that Musk's departure from Trump's inner circle could undermine negotiations on key issues and embolden critics of the administration's agenda. While some believe the dispute will eventually be resolved, others acknowledge the potential for disruption given Musk's influence and reach. The situation underscores the delicate balance required to maintain party unity during a critical legislative period. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongly deported, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges related to human smuggling.

His attorney argues that the charges are an abuse of power and that Abrego Garcia is not the leader of an international smuggling conspiracy. Abrego Garcia was initially deported in error despite having legal status preventing his removal. </p>

          <p>As Washington, D.C., hosts World Pride, some international travelers are choosing to stay away due to safety concerns and protests against President Donald Trump's policies.
