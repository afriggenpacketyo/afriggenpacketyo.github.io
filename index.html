          <p>An investigation is underway to determine who is funding anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots in Los Angeles and other major U.S. cities. Crowds on Demand, a California-based company specializing in providing crowds for protests, reported receiving multiple high-budget requests to participate in the anti-ICE riots, but declined due to concerns about illegal activity. Senator Josh Hawley, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, is sending letters to organizations suspected of providing financial support, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). CHIRLA, which has reportedly sponsored campaigns to abolish ICE, has received $34 million in government grants, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest involving California Governor Gavin Newsom. The investigation aims to determine whether any laws were broken in the funding or organization of the riots.</p>

          <p>A Chinese think tank, the Grandview Institution, suggests that the United States and China establish a "security dialogue mechanism" to prevent conflicts in the South China Sea. The think tank's report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, notes that aerial and maritime interactions between the two countries in the region are confrontational and unpredictable. Despite the competition, the report suggests the situation is manageable, but implementation of crisis management tools remains inconsistent. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations reportedly linked to Iran's nuclear program, which has significantly heightened market fears of a broader conflict. The strikes resulted in the deaths of key Iranian figures, including Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, and Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iranian state media also reported the deaths of two leading nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi. In response, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, vowed to avenge the attacks, while Iranian media confirmed multiple fatalities in Tehran and strikes on Natanz, Khandab, and Khoramabad, although the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was unaffected. Iran has retaliated by launching approximately 100 drones toward Israeli territory, which Israel is attempting to intercept.</p>

Rising global temperatures and erratic rainfall threaten coffee farmers, causing prices to soar, yet coffee remains a vital part of world culture, with approximately two billion cups consumed daily.

          <p>The newly elected Canadian government, led by Mark Carney, has introduced a border bill that is drawing criticism for its sweeping powers related to citizen data and alignment with U.S. refugee policies. Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, grants the immigration minister extensive authority to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake in any immigration stream, potentially leading to mass deportations without appeal processes. The bill also amends the Criminal Code to allow greater access to citizen data and electronic information for law enforcement, raising concerns about privacy rights.

Netanyahu evoked the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust to justify his decision, stating Israel has learned the lessons of history. The move comes despite ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, with some suggesting Israel coordinated the attack with Washington. Netanyahu's hawkish image was tarnished by the 2023 Hamas attack, and he faces an ongoing corruption trial, but he hopes a successful campaign against Iran will secure his legacy.</p>

          <p>For the fourth consecutive night, disorder occurred in Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, though at a lower level than earlier in the week. A crowd threw bricks and masonry at police officers, who responded with warnings of baton rounds. The unrest, which began in Ballymena following a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, has resulted in 41 officers injured and 15 arrests. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Jonathan Buckley called for calm, while police maintained a heavy presence in the town center. The article also mentions an anti-racism protest in west Belfast that passed off peacefully.</p>

          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, but they were allies until Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. The shift occurred as Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Iran then supported Shiite militias against Israel in Lebanon. Despite current hostility, some Iranians question this stance, while hardliners support opposition to Israel. The article details how Iran's actions and rhetoric have shaped the conflict, influencing regional dynamics and international relations. Recent events have further intensified the divide.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has taken measures to assist Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One of these measures is the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to ensure payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, guaranteeing payment for goods or services. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can also be used in the trade of services, providing greater flexibility for businesses.</p>

          <p>Facing dwindling exports and increased competition from Chinese companies, German machinery makers are urging the EU to implement trade barriers. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) is calling for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, with a particular focus on China. The industry group alleges that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and sometimes disregard technical regulations. The VDMA believes these conditions create an uneven playing field, necessitating government intervention to protect German manufacturers.</p>

Trump's threat to raise auto tariffs aims to attract more investment in American manufacturing.

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during its first attempted launch. Leader Kim Jong Un reacted strongly to the initial failure and demanded swift repairs, leading to the arrest of several officials. State media reports the ship has been fully restored, but experts question the completeness of repairs given the rapid relaunch. Kim and his daughter oversaw the event, with Kim announcing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually to develop a nuclear-armed navy.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched attacks on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and key personnel, due to concerns over Iran's nuclear program. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims Iran was in the late stages of assembling nuclear weapons, which prompted the action. Israel's decision was influenced by a perceived weakening of Iran's deterrent power and a desire to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear statehood. The attacks carry risks of retaliation, but Israel believes these risks are less severe with Iran at its weakest.</p>
