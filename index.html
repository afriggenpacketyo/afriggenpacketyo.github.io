Meta is updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove such ads, while also sharing signals about these apps with other tech companies.

The IAEA also expressed concern about Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, which can be used for both reactor fuel and nuclear weapons. Iran has condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility.

Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still depend on other countries for uranium.

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, attack have filed a federal civil lawsuit seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes. The lawsuit cites a 2022 law requiring the plaque's installation by March 2023, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to doing so. The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause, noting that Congress has honored other officers who died in a different tragedy. The lawsuit reflects the ongoing political divisions surrounding the events of January 6 and the recognition of law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a slide in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This is the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation at 0.99% in May, significantly below April's 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of India has relaxed monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%. Economists anticipate further rate cuts, citing softened commodity prices and increased Chinese goods in the market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A skier died in an avalanche on Alaska's Mount McKinley, days after a climber fell 3,000 feet to his death on the same peak. Nicholas Vizzini, 29, triggered the avalanche while descending a slope with his snowboarding partner, who sustained minor injuries. Mountaineering rangers responded and attempted lifesaving measures, but Vizzini was pronounced dead. The climbing season typically runs from early May to early July, with approximately 500 climbers currently on Mount McKinley.

          <p>Some mothers are attempting to delay their daughters' first periods, driven by concerns about the effects of chemicals and a trend toward earlier menarche. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, from 12.5 to 11.9, raising concerns about associated health risks like cardiovascular disease and certain reproductive cancers. These mothers are focusing on changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time to minimize exposure to endocrine disruptors. Experts advise caution, noting that completely avoiding these chemicals is impossible and that restricting diet could lead to unintended consequences, such as eating disorders.</p>

The number of child laborers has decreased from 160 million in 2020 to 138 million, but 86.6 million are in sub-Saharan Africa. Challenges include rapid population growth, poverty, and limited access to quality education. Climate change is exacerbating the problem, pushing families into more hazardous forms of labor, such as mica mining in Madagascar.
