          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard in Los Angeles to support federal immigration enforcement.  A lower court ruled the deployment illegal, finding that the protests did not constitute a "rebellion" justifying federalization of the National Guard.  The Trump administration argues the president has the authority to deploy the National Guard under Title 10, and that the lower court decision jeopardizes public safety.
