            <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University after the university rejected demands to eliminate its DEI programs and screen international students for ideological concerns, including antisemitism. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the university's independence and constitutional rights, arguing that the demands represent governmental regulation of academic freedom. Federal agencies responded by stating that taxpayer support comes with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws and address harassment of Jewish students. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, is prepared to fight the financial pressure, while the administration insists on meaningful change regarding antisemitism on campuses.

            <p>A BBC study reveals that the number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidized theaters has decreased by nearly a third in the past decade due to funding cuts and rising costs. Many venues are now co-producing shows to spread costs, leading to fewer but larger-scale productions. Theater industry figures express concern over the decline in opportunities for young talent and the impact on the workforce, citing low pay and job insecurity. Some venues are adapting by focusing on musicals and collaborations to maintain financial stability.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of manufacturing to the U.S. Most companies surveyed believe that bringing back supply chains would double their costs, leading them to seek low-tariff regimes elsewhere. Over half of the respondents cited cost as the primary reason for not reshoring, while others mentioned the challenge of finding skilled labor. The survey also revealed that a majority of respondents feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America, with cancellation of orders being the most widespread reaction to the tariffs.

            <p>The UN reports that more than 400 people have been killed in recent attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan's Darfur region. The RSF launched an intense assault on refugee camps surrounding El-Fasher, the last state capital in Darfur held by the Sudanese army. The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese army has created a major humanitarian crisis, forcing millions to flee their homes. The UN has verified 148 killings but warns the toll is much higher, with at least nine humanitarian aid workers among the dead. The UK has announced a £120m aid package for Sudan ahead of a conference in London.</p>

            <p>The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was unable to locate any substantive messages from Director John Ratcliffe’s Signal application, finding only administrative content. This occurred during a review of Ratcliffe’s phone to preserve messages. A CIA official stated that only residual administrative content was retrieved from Ratcliffe's personal Signal account. Officials were able to successfully preserve messages from the devices of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is initiating investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors to potentially impose tariffs on national security grounds. The investigations will be conducted under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and must be completed within 270 days. The administration has previously used similar inquiries to justify tariffs on steel, aluminum, and the auto industry. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are currently exempt from existing tariffs, but Trump has indicated they will face separate levies.</p>

Coking coal and iron ore from the US will be delivered to Immingham docks and transported to the site. A separate shipment from Australia is also en route after a legal dispute was resolved. The government intervened to prevent the furnaces from being switched off, which would eliminate the UK's ability to produce virgin steel. The plant employs 2,700 people and is said to be in a "far better position" due to the government's actions.</p>

This claim was made after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele refused to voluntarily return Abrego Garcia. The administration conceded that Abrego Garcia's deportation was an administrative error. The Department of Homeland Security stated it does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.</p>

            <p>The "Silicon Six" tech firms, including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft, are accused of avoiding almost $278 billion in US corporation taxes over the past decade. The Fair Tax Foundation (FTF) claims these companies paid an average of 18.8% in combined national and federal corporation taxes, compared to the US average of 29.7%. The report highlights aggressive tax practices, such as contingency tax positions, and the companies' political influence through lobbying. The analysis suggests that tax avoidance is hardwired into the business models of these tech giants.</p>

            <p>The availability of low-deposit mortgages in the UK has reached its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Data from Moneyfacts indicates a rise in deals requiring a 5% or 10% deposit, offering more options for first-time buyers. However, house prices and mortgage rates remain higher than in previous years. Competition is fierce, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed. The UK housing market has been relatively stable, though uncertainty over interest rates and stamp duty changes persists. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Federal health officials are exploring ways to reduce organ discards and improve the placement process. Hackensack University Medical Center's transplant program accepts kidney offers at three times the national rate and still has a 97.5% patient survival rate one year after surgery, highlighting the benefits of accepting less-than-perfect organs. Reducing organ discards requires a shared commitment between transplant hospitals and OPOs to find homes for kidneys that are hard to place. For patients waiting for transplants, accepting a less-than-perfect organ can mean the difference between life and death.</p>

The state sought assistance to repair an estimated $34 million in damage, but FEMA stated the assistance was “not warranted.” The denial comes as FEMA's future is in question under the Trump administration, which has considered disbanding the agency. The state plans to appeal the decision. The storm system caused widespread damage and power outages, and toppled trees that killed at least two people.</p>
