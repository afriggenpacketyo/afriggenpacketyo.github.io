          <p>A tragic shooting occurred at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulting in two fatalities and ten injuries. The assailant, 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove a vehicle through the church's front doors during a service and opened fire before setting the building ablaze. Police engaged the gunman, who was subsequently killed. Federal agencies like the FBI and ATF are assisting in the investigation to determine the motive behind this horrific act.</p>

          <p>Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the Guard for this purpose, citing the city's stability and local officials' capacity to manage public safety. Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have also opposed the deployment, asserting that the city is not "war-ravaged" and that military intervention is unnecessary for local protests. The lawsuit challenges the administration's actions as a political display rather than a genuine public safety measure.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new conditions for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain in the country. Under Labour's proposals, legal migrants would need to demonstrate high English proficiency, a clean criminal record, and community volunteering. The plan also extends the required period to gain settled status from five to ten years, aiming to differentiate Labour from Reform UK's more stringent immigration stance. Mahmood emphasizes that fair migration and secure borders are crucial for an "open, generous, tolerant" country, urging migrants to prove their contribution to society.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom's significant spending on data center infrastructure is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble of 2000. He argues that today's large tech companies, unlike their predecessors, possess the financial capacity to manage massive capital projects. While acknowledging skepticism about AI's immediate transformative impact, Cramer highlights the demand from major players like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon for AI capabilities, viewing it as a necessity for maintaining dominance. He dismisses comparisons to the past, asserting that the current buildout is a critical industrial revolution, not a speculative bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asian economies are urged to closely monitor the upcoming 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) due to significant trade and investment stakes. In the past five years, Asian exports to USMCA partners surged by nearly 35%, reaching $1.7 trillion, with foreign direct investment exceeding $33 billion. Notably, FDI from Asia to Mexico has more than tripled, driven by desires for USMCA tariff preferences, market access, and trade diversification. Asian nations are advised to engage in the public consultation process to shape the debate and advance their economic interests in North America.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has taken an early lead in parliamentary elections crucial for the country's EU path.

President Sandu had previously warned of "massive Russian interference," and bomb scares were reported at polling stations both domestically and abroad.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a major hurricane, and the developing Tropical Storm Imelda in the western Atlantic could potentially interact in a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This effect describes an "intense dance" where two tropical storms merge or spin around a common center. While an unlikely outcome, especially if one system is significantly weaker, forecasters are monitoring for this interaction. Humberto is expected to remain a powerful hurricane, while Imelda is projected to bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coast, highlighting complex atmospheric dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup emcee, actress and comedian Heather McMahan, has stepped down following a controversial incident where she led a foul-mouthed chant against golfer Rory McIlroy. Videos captured McMahan chanting expletives into a microphone, which was echoed by some spectators. McIlroy and other European players faced significant heckling and jeering throughout the tournament, with McIlroy at one point telling unruly fans to "shut the f--- up." The PGA of America confirmed McMahan's apology, and additional security measures were implemented, highlighting concerns over fan behavior crossing acceptable lines in major sporting events.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are pushing to separate the debate over extending Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) insurance subsidies from the immediate government funding negotiations, arguing the subsidy issue can wait until after a shutdown is averted. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated that the ACA debate is a year-end issue, not a condition for keeping the government open by Tuesday's deadline. Democrats, however, remain firm on their demand to include the tax credit extension, warning that millions of Americans face soaring premiums if the subsidies expire, setting up a critical standoff in the upcoming congressional meeting with President Trump.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly considering Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles to aid its defense against Russia, with Vice President JD Vance indicating President Trump will make the final decision. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought the sale of Tomahawks to European nations for transfer to Ukraine, as Trump expresses frustration over Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to pursue peace. This potential delivery, which includes missiles with a 2,500 km range, would be a significant escalation. Meanwhile, Ukraine continues to face Russian drone and missile attacks, while also demonstrating improved capabilities in striking military targets within Russia.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated his confidence that TikTok's U.S. operations have been successfully separated from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, ensuring data security and preventing its use as a foreign propaganda tool. Following months of uncertainty, President Trump approved a proposal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new joint-venture company, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. Vance emphasized that American investors and businesspeople will primarily control the new entity, valuing TikTok's U.S. business at $14 billion. This move addresses long-standing national security concerns regarding the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's gubernatorial race has been disrupted by the National Archives' accidental release of Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's unredacted military records, including her Social Security number. Sherrill and her Democratic allies allege this was a deliberate weaponization of the federal government by the Trump administration and her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli. While the records confirm her unblemished Navy career, they also revealed a 30-year-old incident where she was implicated in a cheating scandal. Sherrill's campaign is considering legal action, as Ciattarelli calls for full transparency regarding her Naval Academy records.</p>

          <p>The NBA is investigating Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer over allegations that the team circumvented the league's salary cap. The probe focuses on whether a sustainability firm, Aspiration Partners, in which Ballmer was an investor, paid star player Kawhi Leonard $21 million through an endorsement deal to secretly funnel extra money. Ballmer denies wrongdoing, stating his investment predated Leonard's deal and he wasn't involved in negotiations. The investigation seeks to determine if the Clippers participated in arranging the side deal, which could lead to severe penalties like suspensions, fines, or loss of draft picks, impacting the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>Rural Americans relying on the federally funded Head Start program are expressing deep concerns about its future, following an early draft of President Trump’s budget proposal targeting its elimination. For many low-income families in rural areas, Head Start is the sole provider of free childcare, enabling parents like Sara Laughlin to work. The program, which offers early education, health, and family services, is also a significant employer and supports local economies. Despite bipartisan support, Head Start has faced funding freezes, staff cuts, and office closures, leaving its future uncertain and impacting thousands of children and families.</p>
