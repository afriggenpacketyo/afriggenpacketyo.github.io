        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has accused Apple and its Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath during the Epic Games trial, alleging that Roman misrepresented when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on certain App Store purchases. The judge referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings. Rogers also stated that Apple withheld documentation, including information about a meeting with CEO Tim Cook, to conceal their true decision-making process, particularly regarding senior executives, in order to maintain an anticompetitive environment. The court ordered Apple to immediately cease imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps and to pay Epic Games' attorney fees related to this issue.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. marks the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, Vietnam veterans reflect on the war's lasting impact on American culture, politics, and their own lives. Many veterans say the war continues to reverberate through American culture and politics, and the experience still holds pressing lessons that the nation seems not to have learned. Some see parallels between the fall of Saigon and recent events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, highlighting a cycle of national soul-searching and questioning of American involvement in foreign conflicts. Veterans express a mix of sadness, anger, and a longing for closure, while emphasizing the importance of remembering the lessons of the past.</p>
