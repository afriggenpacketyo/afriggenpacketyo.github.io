          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, causing widespread devastation near the Pakistan border. Officials report that the disaster has killed at least 812 people and injured over 2,500 more, with the majority of casualties occurring in Kunar Province. Numerous remote villages have been completely destroyed, and rescue efforts are complicated by rubble and poor communication infrastructure in the affected regions. The United Nations and other international agencies are coordinating relief efforts to assist the thousands of people impacted by the tragic event.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic visit to Taipei, the head of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, referred to Taiwan as a "free country" with the "right to remain free." This declaration of support for Taiwanese self-determination prompted a strong rebuke from China's Foreign Ministry, which opposes any official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan and reiterated its one-China principle. The visit highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the delicate balance of U.S. policy in the region, as Washington continues to be Taiwan's most significant international backer and arms supplier amidst increasing military pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has successfully negotiated a £55 million deal to acquire forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford before the transfer deadline. The agreement, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, was reached after Wissa publicly expressed his desire to leave the club. This move is part of Newcastle's strategy to strengthen their attack, particularly following the record-breaking sale of striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, is seen as a proven Premier League talent capable of filling the offensive gap for the Magpies.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has retracted its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller, who was scheduled to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. A committee spokesperson stated the withdrawal was due to learning that Mueller has health issues that prevent him from appearing. Mueller's family later confirmed to The New York Times that he has been battling Parkinson's disease. The subpoena was initially issued because Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, a period during which Epstein was under investigation by the bureau, and the committee believed he possessed relevant information.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 06:07:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of England's expanded childcare support program has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. While the government claims the scheme can save families thousands annually, many parents are encountering long waiting lists and a shortage of available nursery places. Some parents have even scheduled Caesarean sections to ensure their children's birth dates align with funding eligibility deadlines.

          <p>Following President Trump's executive order to ban no-cash bail, a former top detective from the Chicago Police Department has spoken out against such policies, claiming they allow criminals to act without constraints. The police veteran, Eugene Roy, argues that Illinois' SAFE-T Act, which eliminated cash bail in 2023, has demoralized officers and failed to protect communities from repeat offenders who exploit the system. The article highlights specific cases where individuals released without bail allegedly committed further violent crimes, fueling the national debate over bail reform and its impact on public safety in major cities like Chicago.</p>

          <p>An analytical article examines President Trump's actions and rhetoric in the context of authoritarianism, following his statement that he is "not a dictator." The piece consults political scientists who note that while the U.S. has not become a full dictatorship, Trump's use of military force in cities, threats against political opponents, and pressure on federal agencies are characteristic of leaders in hybrid regimes. Experts suggest his actions represent a form of "performative authoritarianism" that appeals to a specific voter base. The analysis concludes that the U.S. is facing a significant danger of democratic erosion, even if it doesn't fit the classic definition of a dictatorship.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump, despite his anti-globalist stance, operates as a global leader who actively intervenes in international affairs, albeit unconventionally. The author argues that Trump's focus on brokering peace deals, launching limited military strikes, and meddling in the domestic politics of other nations demonstrates a desire to shape the world stage. This "Trump-style globalism" is stripped of liberal internationalist values, instead prioritizing transactional deals and a CEO-like approach to foreign policy. His actions, from cutting foreign aid to proposing the acquisition of territories, reflect a different, yet still engaged, vision of America's role in the world.</p>

Disney's "Lilo & Stitch" was the season's top earner but no film achieved the blockbuster status of the previous year's hits.

          <p>During a Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for members to strengthen cooperation in artificial intelligence while denouncing a "Cold War mentality." Speaking to an audience that included Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Xi positioned China as a global peacemaker amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and major international conflicts. He also proposed a "Global Governance Initiative" and emphasized that the "house rules of a few countries should not be imposed upon others," reinforcing China's push for a multipolar world order.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese tech giant Alibaba soared by over 19% following a strong quarterly earnings report driven by its cloud computing unit. The company's cloud division saw its revenue growth accelerate to 26% year-over-year, with AI-related product revenue showing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Investor optimism was further fueled by a report that Alibaba is developing a new, advanced AI chip. While overall revenue slightly missed expectations, the robust performance in the high-growth cloud and AI sectors signals a positive trajectory for the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

A perimeter has been established at the scene, and investigators are interviewing festival participants. Organizers of the annual art and music event stated they are cooperating fully with law enforcement and have made support services available to attendees.

          <p>As the new school year begins, more students across the United States are facing bans on personal cell phones during school hours, with 31 states and the District of Columbia now having such restrictions. In Texas, a new statewide policy will prohibit phone use for all public and charter school students during the day. Proponents of the bans cite improved student engagement, better academic performance, and reduced anxiety in the classroom. However, the policies face challenges, including enforcement consistency, the high cost of implementation like providing locked pouches, and pushback from some students and parents concerned about communication.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its efforts to curtail the power of federal employee unions by terminating collective bargaining agreements at numerous agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. Citing national security and efficiency, President Trump has issued executive orders that strip bargaining rights from over a million workers, arguing that union activities hinder management and waste taxpayer money. Unions have filed lawsuits, alleging the moves are retaliatory, and federal employees express fears of losing protections related to workplace policies and job security. Critics warn the actions could lead to a significant loss of experienced government workers.</p>

          <p>The official cause of death for Jessica Aber, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has been determined as "sudden unexpected death in epilepsy." Aber, 43, was found dead in her home in March, just two months after resigning from her post on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration for his second term. Her family had previously stated that she suffered from epilepsy for many years and died in her sleep. The State Medical Examiner’s Office has classified the manner of death as natural, confirming earlier beliefs by police that no foul play was involved in her sudden passing.</p>

          <p>Hedge funds are increasingly using options to wager that China's yuan will continue to rally against the U.S. dollar, with some traders targeting a rate of 7 or stronger by year-end. This growing confidence is attributed to expectations of further policy support from Beijing and a potential shift in U.S. interest rate policy. The demand for options that profit from a rising yuan has picked up as the dollar has come under pressure. This market sentiment reflects an improving outlook on Chinese assets, supported by fiscal measures and perceived progress in U.S.-China trade discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Under a March executive order signed by President Donald Trump, the U.S. government will cease issuing paper checks for Social Security benefits by September 30. This move, part of a broader initiative to modernize federal payments, will affect over 500,000 recipients who still receive physical checks. The Social Security Administration cites reduced costs, increased speed, and enhanced security as key reasons for the transition to exclusively electronic payments.

According to the author, she fought off her attacker with the heel of her shoe on a train and ensured the man was arrested. This personal history provides context for her extensive public work supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Sources close to the Queen say she has not publicized the incident previously to keep the focus on the survivors she advocates for, rather than on her own experience.</p>
