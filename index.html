          <p>Sanae Takaichi has won the leadership election for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. A political heir to the nationalist agenda of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hardline conservative and revisionist stances on history. She has pledged to rebuild the party's declining popularity by appealing to right-wing voters while also signaling pragmatic governance to maintain coalition partners. Her controversial views on gender equality and immigration have drawn sharp criticism from opponents.</p>

          <p>A year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, Nike has increased prices on its footwear, apparel, and equipment, with some categories seeing double-digit percentage rises. The move is seen as a way for the company to leverage its brand's pricing power to offset pressures from tariffs and margin compression. While the company posted surprise sales growth recently, it also forecast a weak holiday season, indicating a challenging recovery. This pricing strategy reflects a targeted approach to balance profitability with consumer perception in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell's legal team had argued that her prosecution was barred by a non-prosecution agreement Epstein secured with federal authorities in Florida years prior. The court's decision effectively exhausts her main legal avenues for overturning the conviction. This development leaves a presidential pardon or sentence commutation as one of her few remaining hopes for an early release.</p>

While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, its outer bands are projected to bring heavy rainfall, gusty winds, and life-threatening surf conditions to the region.

          <p>A new report from Adobe Analytics forecasts that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% year-over-year, reaching $253.4 billion.

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have jointly filed a lawsuit to block President Donald Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the National Guard. The legal challenge argues against what it describes as the threat of military occupation being used against cities or states. This move represents a significant escalation in the conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military and law enforcement personnel. The complaint asserts that residents should not be subjected to such actions based on a president's political disfavor.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the political rhetoric of Stephen Miller, a key architect of the Trump administration's domestic agenda, arguing that he consistently frames political and legal opposition as illegitimate acts of terrorism. Miller's recent statements equate unfavorable judicial rulings and protests against ICE with an organized assault on the federal government, justifying the use of state power to dismantle these perceived threats. This worldview rejects neutral standards, portraying any action by the administration as justified and any opposition as an illegal rebellion that must be crushed. The author contends that for Miller, violence is a convenient pretext, not the actual cause, for this approach.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer interest rates that can help savers protect their money's buying power against inflation. While national average yields for one- to five-year terms are below 2% APY, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some six-month and one-year CDs offering over 4% APY. The current inverted yield curve means that short-term CDs often provide better returns than long-term ones. Experts suggest savers look to online banks and consider laddering CDs of various terms to maximize earnings in this environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Verizon has named former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Hans Vestberg, who has led the telecommunications giant since 2018.

The leadership change comes as Verizon navigates a critical period, aiming to increase market share and deliver financial growth. Vestberg will remain on the board and serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition and finalize the acquisition of Frontier Communications.</p>

          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without immediate pay or be furloughed, members of Congress continue to receive their salaries. This is because lawmakers' pay is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. Most members earn $174,000 per year, a rate unchanged since 2009. The President's salary is also constitutionally protected from reduction during their term, ensuring they are paid during a shutdown, though many of their staff may be furloughed.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Before 1980, agencies often continued operating during funding gaps, but legal opinions then established that doing so was illegal. Since then, there have been over a dozen shutdowns, with notable instances under Presidents Reagan, Clinton, Obama, and Trump. These events, once rare, have become a recurring feature of political standoffs, often centered on contentious issues like budget cuts, healthcare, and immigration, causing significant economic and operational disruptions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year deadline. This forces the government to halt all non-essential functions, with essential employees like military personnel and air traffic controllers required to work without immediate pay. While entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare continue, other services can be disrupted, and federal workers are furloughed. This procedural failure stems from the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits agencies from spending money not authorized by law.</p>
