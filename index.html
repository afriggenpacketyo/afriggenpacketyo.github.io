            <p>As the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord is commemorated, the question of who fired the first shot of the American Revolution remains unanswered.

While the colonial side successfully shaped the narrative, historians continue to debate the exact sequence of events. The incident serves as a symbol of America's long journey to liberty, with the ongoing uncertainty only adding to the legend.</p>

            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de LeÃ³n is facing an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income. The ethics report alleges that de LeÃ³n voted on matters benefiting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and USC shortly after receiving income from them. De LeÃ³n maintains that the decisions in question were beneficial to the community and that he would have recused himself if advised to do so. The Ethics Commission noted a pattern of conduct, despite De LeÃ³n's cooperation and lack of prior violations.</p>

            <p>The Tren de Aragua, a notorious gang originating from a Venezuelan prison, has gained international attention for its involvement in various criminal activities. The gang's origins can be traced to the TocorÃ³n prison, where it established control through force and extortion. As Venezuela's economic crisis deepened, the gang expanded its operations beyond the prison walls, engaging in drug trafficking, extortion, and kidnapping. The gang's activities have spread to other countries, leading to concerns about its impact on regional security.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting until midnight Sunday, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized it as a manipulative tactic. Despite the announcement, reports of Russian drone strikes continued, casting doubt on the ceasefire's sincerity. The announcement follows growing frustration from the Trump administration regarding the slow pace of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange mediated by the United Arab Emirates, marking the largest exchange since the conflict began.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, pending further review. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that the individuals were being deported without due process. The White House defended the use of the Act, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists." The case highlights concerns about the administration's use of the wartime law to expedite deportations, particularly in relation to members of the Tren de Aragua gang.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by the January wildfires are suing major California insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging they colluded to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan. The lawsuit claims insurers conspired to eliminate competition, leaving homeowners underinsured with higher premiums and lower coverage limits. The FAIR Plan, designed as a last resort for high-risk areas, has become overwhelmed due to insurers canceling policies. The plaintiffs are seeking damages, arguing the insurers' actions constitute cartel-like behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, identified as Lina, was assessed as "medium" risk by a police algorithm (VioGÃ©n) after reporting threats from her ex-partner, but she was later killed. The case has raised questions about the effectiveness of the algorithm in predicting and preventing domestic violence. Critics argue that police are relying too heavily on the algorithm, potentially overlooking crucial factors in assessing risk. Independent audits and greater transparency are needed to ensure these systems are accurately protecting women at risk.</p>

However, veteran reliever Kirby Yates blew a save in the ninth inning, leading to a 4-3 walk-off defeat for the Dodgers. The loss overshadowed Sasaki's progress and highlighted the bullpen's struggles without key closers.</p>
