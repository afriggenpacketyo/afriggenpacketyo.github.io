          <p>Hunan province in China has pioneered the use of special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks the first instance of these bonds, typically designated for revenue-generating construction projects, being used to cover government arrears. Proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. While seen as a positive step, concerns remain about the adequacy of the sum relative to local government debt and the complexity of repayment due to entangled triangular debts.

          <p>Rice prices in Japan more than doubled in May, marking a significant increase, while the country's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7%, the highest since January 2023. This surge in rice prices prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate costs. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) held rates steady at 0.5% but indicated potential future rate hikes if underlying inflation approaches the 2% target. Japan's GDP also contracted by 0.2% in the quarter ending March, reflecting a decline in exports. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and capricious, lacking specificity in how states should cooperate. California Attorney General Rob Bonta praised the decision, stating that President Trump was attempting to coerce states into carrying out his immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>An expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The depth and reinforcement of the facility make it a challenging target, and the exact nature of its defenses are not fully known. While an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it wouldn't eliminate it entirely, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, and materials to rebuild. The expert emphasized that continued military strikes are not a good option and that diplomacy is the key to preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>AI-generated avatars in China have demonstrated their ability to outsell real people, according to a collaboration between Baidu and livestreamer Luo Yonghao. Luo and his co-host used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers on Baidu's e-commerce platform, generating 55 million yuan in sales. These avatars, built using Baidu's generative AI model, mimicked their jokes and style, resulting in a more successful livestream compared to Luo's previous attempt. This indicates the growing potential of AI in e-commerce and influencing consumer behavior.</p>

          <h2>Europe's Concerns Over China's Overcapacity</h2>

          <p>Europe is increasingly concerned about China's economic overcapacity and its potential impact on European industries. Decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, and weak domestic consumption in China have created a situation where excess industrial output could flood global markets. European governments fear that this could decimate industries, lead to job losses, and fuel populist movements. The EU is urging Beijing to address the issue to avoid a backlash similar to the anti-China sentiment in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Plan to Tie States' Transportation Funds to Immigration Enforcement</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from tying states' transportation funds to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by 20 Democratic-led states, which argued the administration was unlawfully coercing them into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda. The judge agreed that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose such conditions. This decision is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to pressure sanctuary jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest over planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. She stated that she had hoped to fight for changes from within but concluded that those changes were not forthcoming. The government defended the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system.</p>
