          <p>Chinese solar panel manufacturers are exploring alternative locations for factories in response to new US tariffs on imports from Southeast Asia. The tariffs, finalized by American trade officials, impose steep duties on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The erratic tariff policies of the Trump administration are adding uncertainty to long-term investment plans. Southeast Asia has become a major destination for Chinese solar firms seeking to bypass US tariffs on direct imports from China.</p>
