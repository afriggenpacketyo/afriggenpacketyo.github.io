          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a surprise profit for the third quarter and anticipates record sales for the final three months of the year, driven by strong travel demand and higher fares. The carrier expects unit revenue to rise 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% year-over-year, assuming current demand levels persist. Despite cutting its 2025 profit forecast earlier, Southwest reaffirmed its outlook. The company's efforts to enhance competitiveness, including abandoning policies like open seating, contribute to its positive revenue growth. This article highlights the airline's strong financial performance and optimistic demand forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions against Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, aiming to pressure Moscow into a peace deal in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these measures are crucial to cut off Kremlin funding for the war and urged an immediate ceasefire, noting readiness for further action to support President Trump's peace efforts. This announcement follows intense Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, which killed at least seven people, including children, and comes after President Trump shelved plans for a meeting with Vladimir Putin due to a lack of honest commitment to peace. NATO allies are also discussing a 12-point plan for a ceasefire, return of deported children, and prisoner exchange, alongside increased military and economic pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, delivered a marathon speech spanning over 22 hours on the Senate floor, protesting President Trump's policies. Merkley criticized the administration's deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, and the deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland, Oregon, which he represents. He warned that the nation faces its most perilous moment since the Civil War, accusing President Trump of shredding the Constitution and attempting to strengthen an authoritarian grip by exaggerating civil unrest. This historic address, among the longest in Senate history, highlighted the ongoing political impasse and government shutdown, drawing support from fellow Democrats while Republicans criticized the timing amidst unpaid Capitol Police.</p>

          <h2>Former Biden Administration Officials Advocate for High-Tech Industrial Strategy Over Broad Manufacturing Revival</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former officials from the Biden administration are urging Washington to prioritize strategic, cutting-edge technologies in its industrial policy, rather than pursuing a wholesale revival of U.S. manufacturing. Gina Raimondo, former Commerce Secretary, highlighted the necessity of industrial policy for national security in areas like the Chips Act, but expressed disagreement with a broader "make everything in America" approach. This perspective comes amidst debates on whether the U.S. should adopt elements of China's state-led advanced manufacturing strategy, with Raimondo suggesting the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage in certain basic manufacturing sectors. The article outlines a nuanced approach to industrial growth.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, ending two consecutive periods of decline, but its earnings missed analyst estimates, causing the stock to fall about 2%. Total revenue climbed to $28.10 billion, with automotive revenue up 6%. However, net income fell 37% due to lower EV prices and a 50% increase in operating expenses, partly attributed to AI and R&D projects. The end of federal EV tax credits also pulled sales forward into the quarter. Despite the stock drop, Tesla aims for "volume production" of Cybercab, Semi trucks, and Megapack 3 in 2026, and its energy generation business saw significant growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Broderick Jones playfully suggested he might tackle quarterback Aaron Rodgers again, despite Rodgers' initial anger over a recent touchdown celebration. Jones, a 300-pound player, brought Rodgers to the ground after a 68-yard touchdown pass, causing the veteran quarterback, who is two years removed from an Achilles injury, to fume. Jones clarified that there's "no love lost" between them, stating they are still joking about the incident, and Rodgers even told him "Don't lose the fire." The article notes Rodgers appeared uninjured by the poorly judged celebration tackle and the Steelers are now preparing to face his former team, the Green Bay Packers, marking Rodgers' first game against them since his 2023 trade.</p>

The incident occurred during President Trump's state visit in September and was carried out by the UK-based campaign group Led By Donkeys, focusing on Trump's past links to Epstein, including an alleged letter. The police had arrested the men on suspicion of offenses like malicious communications and public nuisance, but an investigation concluded that no further action would be taken, with a group spokesperson calling the arrests "ridiculous" and "heavy-handed."

          <p>New research published in Neurology Open Access indicates that adults with gum disease may have a higher likelihood of showing signs of damage to the brain's white matter. Dr. Souvik Sen, a study author, explained that gum disease is associated with inflammation, which is linked to atherosclerosis and hardening of small blood vessels. A separate study, also led by Sen, found that having both gum disease and cavities increases stroke risk by 86% compared to individuals with healthy mouths. However, maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular brushing, flossing, and dentist visits, was shown to reduce stroke risk by as much as 81%.

The company was reclassified under Section 301 program terms, with fees now based on vessel net tonnage capacity rather than the number of vehicles carried, despite 80% of ACL's freight being containers. Andrew Abbott, ACL's CEO, warns that these unforeseen costs could force the company to relocate operations, impacting U.S. importers and exporters who rely on their unique hybrid service for oversize cargo.

This discovery is part of a broader trend of new insect species appearing in Iceland due to rising global temperatures and increased international transportation. While these mosquitoes can sting, the species is not known to carry infections in Nordic regions, primarily posing a nuisance rather than a deadly threat.

          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to increase by 40% this year, reaching $1.32 per pound, significantly impacting retailers ahead of Thanksgiving. This surge is primarily due to a shrinking supply, a result of slightly weakened demand and ongoing avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million turkeys this year. Despite the wholesale increase, economists anticipate a smaller rise in consumer prices, as retailers often use turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract holiday shoppers. Major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are already offering competitive deals, aiming to keep Thanksgiving meal costs under $4 per person, demonstrating efforts to mitigate the impact on budget-conscious consumers.</p>

          <p>Israeli lawmakers have voted to advance two proposed bills for the formal annexation of the West Bank, an ambition opposed by President Trump, who stated he would not allow it. The Knesset's vote occurred during Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel, aimed at shoring up the Gaza ceasefire. Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud party called the votes a "provocation" damaging U.S. relations, with most Likud members boycotting. The Palestinian foreign ministry and Jordan strongly condemned the moves, emphasizing that the West Bank is occupied Palestinian territory and warning against undermining the two-state solution. All Israeli settlements in the West Bank are widely considered illegal under international law.</p>

          <p>U.S. forces conducted a strike on an alleged drug boat in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board, as confirmed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks the eighth U.S. strike against suspected drug vessels since September 2nd, and the first in the Pacific. Hegseth stated that "narco-terrorists" will find no safe harbor, equating their actions to a war on the U.S. homeland. The Trump administration recently declared it is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug-trafficking organizations. This operation comes amidst rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government regarding drug production and U.S. subsidies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans are likely to receive heftier tax refunds next year, largely due to new provisions in the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act, according to an Oxford Economics analysis. Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through larger refunds or reduced 2026 tax bills. The new law, signed by President Trump in July, extended 2017 tax reductions and added breaks like eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, and lifting the SALT deduction cap to $40,000. Because the IRS has not yet updated withholding tables, many taxpayers will have overpaid this year, leading to a "windfall" at tax time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American missionary was kidnapped from his home in Niamey, Niger's capital, by three armed men, according to multiple security sources. The abduction occurred just 100 yards from the presidential palace, where ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since a 2023 coup. The U.S. Embassy in Niamey issued a security alert, warning American citizens of a heightened risk of kidnapping throughout Niger and implementing increased security measures for its personnel. The kidnapped individual has worked for a U.S.-based charity for years, and his phone was tracked to an area considered a sanctuary for groups affiliated with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.</p>

Similarly, Broadcom's AI revenue might reach $100 billion by 2027, far exceeding average projections.
