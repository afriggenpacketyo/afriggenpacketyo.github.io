            <h2>Trump's Trade Goals Face Uncertainty Amid Tariff Adjustments</h2>

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff announcements have created uncertainty in global trade. While he aims to secure better trade deals and boost American industry, his on-again, off-again tariff moves have created instability. Trump hopes to face off with China and raise revenue through tariffs, but these efforts carry enormous risk and could alienate allies. Trump's trade strategy includes the suspension of higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while escalating trade tensions with China, raising questions about the long-term impact on the US economy.

            <p>The European Union is finding itself in a position of increased leverage when dealing with China as the trade war between the US and China intensifies. With the US imposing significant tariffs on China, the EU is not currently targeted, giving it a stronger hand in negotiations. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot's recent ultimatum to Beijing regarding cognac imports exemplifies this shift, highlighting the EU's growing confidence in its ability to influence China's trade policies. This situation presents Europe with an opportunity to advance its economic interests on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

The court upheld a lower court order but asked for clarification on the extent to which the administration must "effectuate" his return, respecting executive branch authority in foreign affairs. Garcia's lawyer expressed that the rule of law prevailed and that it's time to bring him home. The Justice Department acknowledged the President's prerogative in foreign affairs but the decision is seen as a rebuke to the administration's deportation policies.</p>

            <p>The RSPB reports a decline in starling sightings in UK gardens, marking the lowest number since the survey began in 1979. Starlings, known for their murmurations, are among the UK's fastest disappearing birds. The RSPB encourages small actions like avoiding pesticides and installing nest boxes to support starlings and other garden wildlife. The organization also calls for government and business involvement in restoring the natural world.</p>

            <p>Will Poulter and Kit Connor, along with the cast of Alex Garland's film 'Warfare,' bonded intensely during a three-week military bootcamp to prepare for their roles as soldiers in the Iraq War. The cast shaved their heads and later got matching tattoos to commemorate the experience. Based on a real-life mission, the film aims to recreate the events as accurately as possible, even enlisting the help of a former Navy Seal who was involved in the original operation.</p>

            <p>A general strike in Argentina against public spending cuts has severely disrupted transport, with cancelled flights and suspended train services. The strike, the third since President Javier Milei took office, is in response to austerity measures aimed at tackling hyperinflation. Unions argue that these measures disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers. While Milei's plan has reduced inflation, it has also led to widespread protests and concerns about economic hardship.</p>

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant drops. China announced countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%. Markets had initially surged on Wednesday following Trump's tariff-pause announcement, but the optimism proved short-lived. (not investment advice)</p>
