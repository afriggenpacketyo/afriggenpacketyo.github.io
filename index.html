          <p>Israel initiated a major military operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, military commanders, and scientists, citing an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. The strikes involved 200 Israeli fighter jets hitting over 100 targets across Iran, including Tehran and Natanz. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, with reports of interceptions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, leading to airspace closures and flight cancellations across the region. International reactions have been swift, with the U.S. distancing itself from the Israeli strikes and urging Iran not to target American interests. The exchange of fire has escalated tensions between the two nations, raising fears of a broader regional conflict. The optimism score reflects the high degree of volatility and uncertainty in the region, indicating a potential for further escalation and instability.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies to counter China's restrictions on REE exports. Indian officials are exploring how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase REE production, following a pause in China's exports that has affected manufacturers globally. India possesses substantial REE reserves, ranking third globally, and has nearly 35% of the world's beach and sand mineral deposits. However, India lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan, contributing less than 1% of global REE production.</p>

The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, highlights confrontational interactions in the region but notes that competition remains manageable. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi call for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security, maritime legal order, law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz confirmed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed him of Israel's military action against Iran. The German government has expressed concern over Iran's atomic weapons program, viewing it as a threat to the region, especially Israel. Merz called for restraint from all sides to prevent further escalation and offered Germany's mediation. A meeting of the German government's security cabinet was convened, and Berlin is coordinating with partners, particularly Britain, France, and the United States, to ensure Iran cannot develop nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The article emphasizes that the recent strikes on Iran were a unilateral decision by Israel, despite President Trump's urging against such action. Trump feared that an attack would jeopardize ongoing negotiations with Iran. Although Washington was informed in advance and monitored the strikes, the U.S. Secretary of State made it clear that the U.S. was not involved and prioritized the safety of American personnel. The article suggests that Netanyahu valued his relationship with Trump but acted on Israel's terms, driven by concerns over Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Canada's newly elected government is facing criticism for tabling a border bill that grants law enforcement sweeping powers to access citizen data and aligns Canada's refugee policies with those of the U.S. The Strong Borders Act changes the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, granting the immigration minister extensive powers to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake. The legislation also enhances law enforcement's access to data and electronic information, raising concerns about privacy rights. Critics argue that the bill infringes on due process and constructs a surveillance state.</p>

          <p>Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan "strongly condemns" Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, viewing it as an escalation of the situation. Iwaya expressed regret that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran, urging both countries to exercise utmost restraint. Japan, heavily reliant on Middle Eastern crude oil imports, traditionally maintains friendly relations with both Iran and Israel. The government pledged to take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in the region.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Israel's decision to launch a military operation against Iran, citing concerns over Iran's progress towards assembling nuclear weapons. Israel claims that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon. The article suggests that Iran's perceived loss of deterrent power, due to Israel's repeated attacks on Iranian interests, may have prompted a shift in strategy. The attacks carry risks of retaliation, but Israel may have calculated that these risks are less if Iran is at its weakest.</p>

          <p>Disorder continued in Portadown, Northern Ireland, for a fourth consecutive night, with a crowd throwing masonry at police.

Meanwhile, an anti-racism protest took place in west Belfast, and the PSNI Chief Constable described the violence in Ballymena as "racist", with families hiding in attics during the disturbances.</p>

          <p>The article explores the historical context of the animosity between Iran and Israel, tracing the shift from allies before the 1979 Islamic Revolution to sworn enemies. The Iranian Revolution led to the severing of ties, with Ayatollah Khomeini criticizing Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. Iran's current leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maintains an antagonistic stance, questioning the Holocaust. While some Iranians support the country's hostility toward Israel, others, like Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani and Sadegh Zibakalam, have criticized this stance.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of tariffs by the United States, China has encouraged the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters sell their products domestically. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, function similarly to international L/Cs, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can also be used in the trade of services. This measure aims to support businesses in pivoting to the domestic market amid trade tensions.</p>

          <p>German machinery makers, represented by the VDMA, are urging the EU to implement trade barriers to protect them from Chinese competition. Citing dwindling exports and "unfair state subsidies" for Chinese competitors, the VDMA calls for countervailing duties on imports from third countries that violate EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules. The industry group emphasizes its readiness to compete on a level playing field but insists that current conditions are unfair. VDMA's president, Bertram Kawlath, states that Chinese companies are heavily subsidized and sometimes disregard technical regulations.</p>
