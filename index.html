          <p>A significant explosion occurred at the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, resulting in at least four deaths and over 500 injuries, according to state media. The cause of the blast remains unclear, but authorities suggest it may have been triggered by the ignition of chemical containers, leading to widespread damage, including collapsed buildings and shattered windows in the vicinity. Bandar Abbas's strategic location along the Strait of Hormuz makes it a crucial shipping lane for global oil and natural gas, raising concerns about potential disruptions to international trade. The incident is under investigation, and emergency crews are actively working to rescue those trapped and provide medical assistance. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A conscious parenting coach cautions against the common phrase "You're okay," arguing it can invalidate children's emotions and hinder their ability to process feelings. This phrase, while seemingly comforting, can teach children to doubt their instincts and suppress their emotions to remain accepted. It can also rewire a child’s stress response, making it harder to trust, regulate, and feel safe being fully themselves. Instead, parents should validate their children's feelings and allow them to move through the emotional experience. Optimism score: 65</p>
