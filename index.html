        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration allegedly diverted 20,000 anti-drone missiles, initially promised to Ukraine, to American forces in the Middle East, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. These missiles were intended to counter Russian Shahed drones used in bombardments. The diversion occurred as the U.S. anticipates potential conflict with Iran, prompting Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to redirect the weapons. This action coincided with Hegseth's absence from a key Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting and follows the halting of new U.S. military aid packages to Ukraine.</p>
