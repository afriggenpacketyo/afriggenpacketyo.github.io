          <p>Recent ICE raids in Los Angeles have sparked protests and outrage from elected officials and immigrant rights activists, who condemn the actions as cruel and terrorizing the immigrant community. Federal agents detained employees at a clothing wholesaler, using flash-bang grenades and pepper spray on protesters. Community organizations reported numerous ICE sightings near schools and other public areas, intensifying fear among residents. Elected officials have criticized the raids, emphasizing Los Angeles's history as a city built by immigrants and condemning the use of fear tactics. The LAPD and Sheriff's Department stated they would not participate in civil immigration enforcement. The situation is escalating as the White House pushes for increased arrests and deportations nationwide. This has resulted in heightened tensions and a demand for investigation into ICE tactics.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement, with both countries aiming to strike a deal by mid-June despite persistent disagreements. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, noted that progress has been made after talks with U.S. officials, but significant hurdles remain. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently amount to a 24 percent duty on Japanese goods. Japan has presented a comprehensive package of proposals, including cooperation in supply chains, shipbuilding, and increased imports of U.S. farm products, to address U.S. concerns about non-tariff barriers. No decision has been made on whether there will be another round of tariff talks next week or beyond. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing public discontent over soaring rice prices, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul the country's rice policy ahead of a crucial national election. Rice prices have doubled, prompting Ishiba to consider reforming the decades-old production adjustment system. The aim is to boost rice production and address public support for cutting the consumption tax. Ishiba's efforts include releasing reserve rice under direct contracts with retailers to lower prices, despite challenges such as potential oversupply and opposition from lawmakers with agricultural interests. These moves are seen as a political strategy to gain support before the election, but some experts warn against using rice policy as a political tool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent ICE raids across the country have been met with increasing resistance from protesters, leading to tense confrontations between agents and community members. In San Diego, a raid on a local restaurant resulted in chaotic scenes as protesters surrounded ICE agents, who responded with flash-bangs. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons defended the agents' use of masks, citing death threats and online harassment targeting their families. Civil rights groups assert the public's right to observe and protest, emphasizing the importance of bystanders informing individuals of their rights during arrests. The situation is further complicated by the fact that ICE agents sometimes participate in larger criminal investigations, causing confusion among protesters. This underscores the need for transparency and accountability in immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief who escaped from prison while serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, has been recaptured after nearly two weeks on the run. Hardin was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit, where he escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. Law enforcement officials, including a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit, located Hardin near Moccasin Creek, and he was taken into custody. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders expressed gratitude for the collaborative effort of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies in bringing the search to a peaceful conclusion. The FBI and U.S. Marshals had offered a combined $25,000 reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

Residents report privacy concerns and reduced enjoyment of their property due to the drone surveillance. The lawsuit argues that this practice violates the California Constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling 14 flights a day through the end of July due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs. President Trump's tariff agenda has disrupted supply chains, forcing companies to raise prices, and the aviation industry has warned of its impact. Alaska Airlines is cutting routes served by multiple flights to minimize disruption, focusing on controlling costs and accommodating affected passengers. Delta Air Lines previously avoided tariffs by having new Airbus A350 airlines delivered to Japan before bringing them to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges. The indictment alleges Abrego Garcia conspired to transport undocumented migrants, including MS-13 members, and engaged in gun running and drug smuggling. Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed Abrego Garcia played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring, while his attorney argues the charges are an abuse of power. Garcia's case sparked backlash after his deportation violated a court order, leading to a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. His arraignment is scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly considered creating a new political party, potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new party representing the '80% in the middle,' and endorsed the name 'America Party.' Starting a new party is challenging due to ballot access regulations and campaign finance limits. Musk's engagement in politics follows a dispute with Trump over domestic policy and threats to cut subsidies to Musk's companies. The move could signal Musk's intent to challenge Trump's influence and remain politically active.</p>

          <p>The return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, raises questions about the Trump administration's approach to justice. For nearly three months, the Justice Department repeatedly flouted court orders to facilitate his release from El Salvador. This reversal follows a series of court orders, including one from the Supreme Court, demanding that the administration facilitate his return. The situation highlights a potential conflict between the administration's policies and the principles of due process.</p>

The US Attorney General stated that El Salvador agreed to release Mr √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the US presented an arrest warrant. The White House had previously resisted a US Supreme Court order to facilitate his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees. The allegations, which date back to 2016, allege he transported undocumented individuals between Texas and Maryland and other states more than 100 times.</p>
