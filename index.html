          <p>Two maintenance workers at Columbia University have settled a complaint with the school for an undisclosed amount. The janitors alleged they were held hostage, assaulted, and subjected to antisemitic slurs by anti-Israel protesters who occupied Hamilton Hall on campus in April 2024. While their complaint with the university is resolved, they are still pursuing a separate lawsuit against 40 individual protesters they accuse of causing physical injuries and PTSD. This settlement is part of a larger agreement by the university to address civil rights violations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a tour of a Federal Reserve renovation project, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly disputed the total cost. Mr. Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell contested, explaining it incorrectly included a building completed five years ago. The president has previously criticized the project's expense and suggested it could be grounds for firing Powell, though he later stated he doesn't think it's necessary. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve over spending and interest rate policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. The decision was framed as part of a commitment to a two-state solution and was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "reward for terror." Macron emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and the demilitarization of Hamas as essential components for achieving a just and lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the iconic professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, has passed away at the age of 71 from an apparent cardiac arrest at his home in Florida. Hogan was a transformative figure in entertainment, catapulting the WWE into a global phenomenon in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona. Beyond the ring, he appeared in numerous films and TV shows and became a vocal supporter of President Trump, famously endorsing him at the 2024 RNC. His death marks the end of an era for a pop culture figure who profoundly shaped modern entertainment.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a prominent suicide prevention charity, is planning to close more than 100 of its 200 branches across the UK and Ireland over the next decade. The organization's leadership stated the move is necessary as the current network is not sustainable and hinders service delivery, with too much income spent on building maintenance. However, the proposal has sparked significant concern among volunteers, who fear that a shift to "virtual volunteering" from home will lead to an exodus of support staff and undermine the charity's 70-year-old community-based model.</p>

The proposed agreement, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, still requires council votes and faces challenges related to the transfer of the federal land.

This article analyzes his career, arguing that he pioneered a form of celebrity brand management and direct-to-fan engagement that predated social media. Hogan's journey saw him transform from a patriotic hero to a villain, survive scandals including a sex tape and racist remarks, and ultimately align his brand with President Trump's political style.

Their firings come as the nation's immigration court backlog approaches four million cases.

          <p>Heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, on Thursday, leading to road closures and the rescue of at least five people trapped by rushing water. The area has been highly vulnerable to flooding this summer due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the surrounding hillsides of vegetation. This event comes less than three weeks after a massive flood in the same community killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. Videos shared by residents showed muddy torrents destroying property and toppling trees, highlighting the ongoing danger from the region's summer rainy season.</p>

          <p>According to this analysis, the 2028 Democratic presidential primary has unofficially begun, with potential candidates like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom making strategic media appearances on a wide range of podcasts and shows. These appearances are seen as an attempt to reach new voters and signal a rhetorical shift toward the political center, with some candidates openly criticizing the party for being "too extreme." This early positioning is not just for voters but also for donors and party elites to begin assessing the field in what is seen as a necessary course correction after the 2024 election loss.</p>

          <p>Northern Finland is experiencing a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures in Lapland hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks, breaking a record last set in 1972. The extreme heat is disrupting life in the region, affecting the local reindeer population and puzzling tourists who expected a cool climate. Scientists point to climate change as a contributing factor, noting that the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual weather highlights the growing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on delicate ecosystems and local traditions, even in the Arctic Circle.</p>

          <p>This article examines Realty Income, a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) known as a "Dividend Aristocrat" for its consistent history of dividend growth. The company maintains a high occupancy rate of 98.5% and focuses on tenants in recession-resistant sectors like grocery and wholesale clubs, with over 90% of its retail rent coming from essential service providers. The firm is also expanding its portfolio in Europe to diversify its income streams. Analysts give the stock a "Moderate Buy" consensus rating, suggesting it is a compelling option for investors who prioritize steady, passive income over high growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, removing a final regulatory obstacle for the deal. FCC Chair Brendan Carr praised Skydance's commitments, which include hiring a CBS News ombudsman to review bias complaints and affirming the company will not have DEI initiatives. The decision was not unanimous, with the lone Democrat on the panel, Commissioner Anna Gomez, dissenting strongly. She argued the approval was tainted by Paramount's recent legal settlement with President Trump, calling it a move that erodes press freedom.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are not spending too much on artificial intelligence, but are in fact "underspending." He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and continued investment is crucial for success. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased capital expenditures for its cloud and AI services, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI chatbot will achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive financial outlays. (not investment advice)</p>

While these natural colors can be more expensive to produce, the cost impact on the final product is minimal. Food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to phase out artificial colors, facing the challenge of reformulating iconic products without losing consumer appeal.</p>

Despite being eligible for parole since 1999, his release was repeatedly denied, allegedly due to U.S. and Israeli pressure.

The meeting comes just days after the three European powers warned they would reimpose UN sanctions on Tehran by the end of August if it does not show verifiable progress in curbing its nuclear program. This "snapback" of sanctions is the main leverage the Europeans hold, as the U.S. has been engaging in its own separate, now-stalled talks. Analysts believe a major breakthrough is unlikely, but the talks represent an important effort to keep diplomatic channels open and de-escalate rising tensions.</p>
