          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced a significant 67% increase in sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, during the second quarter. Despite this surge, revenues slightly missed analyst forecasts, leading to a minor drop in share prices. The company is implementing cost-cutting measures and sharpening its commercial focus following recent stock declines and a surprise change in CEO leadership. This comes as the pharmaceutical industry faces pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year agreement to become the exclusive U.S. streaming home for the WWE's premium live events, including WrestleMania and Royal Rumble, starting in 2026. The deal, valued at an average of $325 million annually, marks a significant increase from the previous rights holder, Peacock. All major events will be available on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with some also airing on its linear networks. This partnership aims to expand WWE's audience and help ESPN attract a younger, more diverse viewership beyond traditional sports.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its streaming services and theme parks. While overall revenue saw a modest 2% rise, it fell just short of projections, weighed down by a 15% revenue dip in the traditional TV business. The direct-to-consumer streaming segment grew, with Disney+ adding 1.8 million subscribers, and the company raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in its growth trajectory.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent far-right online influencer known as Bronze Age Pervert has published a critique of the economic nationalism driving President Trump's tariff policies. The article argues that attempting to revive American manufacturing through tariffs is a flawed strategy that misunderstands modern economics and cedes the future to China. This piece is notable as it represents a significant ideological fissure within the right-wing movement, pitting a neo-Nietzschean worldview against the more protectionist, pro-labor stance of economic nationalists. The essay is seen as an attempt to influence policy from within the MAGA coalition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a poster for BrewDog's Wingman beer, ruling that it improperly implied alcohol could solve problems like boredom, frustration, and loneliness. The ad, which featured the tagline "Always Got Your Back," compared the beer's reliability to life's minor frustrations, such as failing WiFi. BrewDog defended the ad, stating it was meant to highlight the product's consistent quality, not its therapeutic effects. This is not the first time the Scottish brewing company has faced censure from the advertising watchdog for its marketing campaigns.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have arrested a 37-year-old man suspected of being a serial killer who targeted homeless individuals. The suspect, known locally as the "machete man," allegedly lured at least five victims to his home in Jujuy province, where he murdered and dismembered them. The investigation began after five missing persons were last seen in the same area, with security footage linking the suspect to two of them. A raid on his home uncovered human remains, and his 16-year-old nephew provided a chilling account of the weekly killings.</p>

          <p>The recent standoff where Texas Democratic legislators left the state to block a Republican redistricting effort is part of a long political tradition dating back to 1870. This tactic, known as "breaking quorum," involves depriving the statehouse of the minimum number of members required to conduct business. The article recounts several key instances, including a 38-day walkout in 2021 to protest voting restrictions and a 2003 exodus to halt a previous redistricting plan. While legislators face potential fines and arrest warrants within Texas, the strategy has a history of successfully stalling or defeating contentious bills.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being politically unpopular and economically questionable, President Trump's tariffs could become a lasting feature of U.S. fiscal policy due to the significant revenue they generate. The article projects that the tariffs could yield $2.2 trillion over the next decade, effectively acting as a major tax hike enacted without congressional approval. As the U.S. faces rising deficits and an aging population, future presidents may be reluctant to repeal these revenue streams, especially given Congress's aversion to raising other taxes. This creates a political dynamic where a flawed policy might persist out of fiscal necessity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An astrophysicist argues that the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to basic research represent a severe threat to American scientific progress and leadership. The article contends that slashing funding for agencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation will dismantle the infrastructure that has driven innovation and economic growth for decades. While acknowledging the pragmatic benefits of science, the author emphasizes the unquantifiable value of curiosity-driven inquiry, which has historically led to unpredictable, transformative discoveries. The piece warns that ceding scientific leadership will have long-term negative consequences for the nation.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy that prohibits hiring students who lack legal immigration status for on-campus jobs. The court found that the university's justification for the policy—fear of violating federal law and potential retaliation—was insufficient and that the policy is discriminatory under state law. While the ruling does not force the UC system to hire undocumented students, it mandates a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argue the ban denies students crucial financial and career opportunities.</p>

          <p>Two women from Cwmbran, Wales, had their Airbnb booking request for a stay in Manchester rejected by a host explicitly because of their nationality. After booking a room for a concert trip, the guests received a refund and a message from the host stating the reason for the decline was "Because you're from Wales." The women expressed shock and said the interaction was pure discrimination. Airbnb has suspended the host, who was previously designated a "superhost," while it investigates the incident, stating that discrimination has no place on its platform.</p>

          <p>The civil war in Sudan serves as a stark illustration of the collapse of the post-WWII liberal world order, where international laws and institutions no longer hold sway. The conflict, a brutal power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, has devolved into nihilistic violence, fueled by foreign middle powers like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, who pursue their own transactional interests. The article describes a landscape of widespread destruction, a massive humanitarian crisis with millions displaced and facing starvation, and civilians being systematically targeted and sexually assaulted. In this vacuum, American and UN influence has become negligible, replaced by anarchy.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia is leading a renewed international effort to recognize a Palestinian state, a move seen as both a strategic diplomatic maneuver and a revival of its 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. This push, which has gained support from several European nations, is driven by multiple factors, including the need for regional stability to achieve Saudi Arabia's own economic diversification goals. The article suggests that by championing this cause, Riyadh is consolidating its influence in the Arab world, countering its past image as a "traitor" to the Palestinian cause, and positioning itself as a key player in any post-war regional architecture.</p>

Despite format tweaks, the competition struggles for authenticity, especially when compared to the historic U.S. Open Cup, which has seen its profile diminish. The author suggests that the tournament is another example of MLS constantly reinventing itself in a search for profitability and relevance in a crowded global football market.</p>

In response, companies like Chegg and Macmillan Learning are integrating their own AI tutors, aiming to provide more guided, accurate, and curriculum-specific support than general chatbots. The article explores how students are adapting, with some mixing AI with older tools while others worry about over-reliance and the cheapening of their education.
