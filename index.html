          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to map the genetic diversity of Southeast Asian populations, which were previously overlooked in the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, represents a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams and includes genome sequencing for over 3,000 individuals from six countries, covering five language families and 30 ethnic languages. The study has revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry in these populations, aiming to rectify the historical underrepresentation of mainland Southeast Asia in global genomic databases. This initiative involves extensive fieldwork and community engagement, adhering to local ethical protocols. The optimism score is based on the progress of genetic research and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in scientific advancements.</p>

The FBI is investigating the incident as a suspected act of terrorism, noting that the suspect used a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices. The victims, aged 52 to 88, sustained injuries, including burns, and were attending a weekly demonstration organized by a pro-Israeli group. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian national who had overstayed his visa. The incident prompted a large police response and condemnation from officials.</p>

          <p>Stocks of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new company, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday. (not investment advice)</p>
