          <p>A transgender high school athlete in California, AB Hernandez, is facing criticism and team forfeitures from opponents for participating in girls' volleyball. Despite the controversy, Hernandez expresses frustration at being misunderstood and remains determined to compete with her team. The situation has become a focal point in the national debate over transgender athletes in female sports, even prompting a lawsuit from the Trump administration against California's gender-participation policies. Hernandez emphasizes that she is just a normal kid playing sports and wishes people would get to know her.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, he created websites to document miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His path to sainthood was fast-tracked after the Vatican attributed two miracles to him, a move seen as an effort to inspire faith in younger generations. Pilgrims are visiting sites associated with his life, including his baptismal church in London, ahead of the ceremony.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team's performance struggles continued with a 2-0 loss to South Korea in a friendly match, raising concerns just months before they co-host the World Cup. The team, featuring an experimental roster, showed a lack of defensive communication and failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. South Korea, led by a goal from Son Heung-min, appeared more cohesive and was buoyed by a supportive crowd in New Jersey. The result extends a period of malaise for the USMNT as they search for form ahead of the major tournament.</p>

          <p>After nearly four decades, Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, prompting questions about the magazine's future relevance in a fast-paced digital world. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with transforming Vogue by merging high fashion with popular culture, famously putting celebrities like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits the challenge of keeping the iconic print publication influential amidst competition from social media and changing cultural tastes. The transition marks a pivotal moment for both Vogue and the broader fashion industry.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The rule change, which ended the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued under $800, now requires duties to be collected on these items. According to the Universal Postal Union, the new burden on carriers has caused major operational disruptions, with 88 postal operators suspending some or all services to the U.S. The administration argues the change closes a loophole exploited by foreign businesses and criminals.</p>

Conversely, factors that could support the market include bullish analyst forecasts, potential policy tailwinds from tax cuts, and the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.

          <p>The recent regular-season game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is part of the NFL's broader strategy for sustained global growth. The league aims to move beyond one-off events and build year-round fan engagement in international markets, with games also planned for Europe and Australia. The sell-out crowd of nearly 50,000 in Brazil demonstrates strong interest, which the NFL hopes to cultivate through media deals and team-led events. The long-term goal is to establish American football as a major global sport property.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean airbase in Antarctica for landing a plane without proper permission. Guo was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research. He was released after agreeing to pay $30,000 in penalties, which will be donated to a childhood cancer foundation, and is banned from Chilean territory for three years. Guo described his detention as "mundane" and praised the Chilean people for their hospitality.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the uninspired performance drew criticism and saw many fans leave the stadium early. Despite dominating possession, Thomas Tuchel's side struggled to create clear chances, relying on an own goal and a Declan Rice header to secure the victory. The lackluster display continues a trend of underwhelming performances under Tuchel, raising concerns about the team's progress since he took over. While England remains in a strong position to qualify, the performance suggests they must improve significantly ahead of tougher matches.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 people, mostly South Korean nationals, at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Georgia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate often called the "godfather of AI," predicts that artificial intelligence will lead to massive unemployment and a huge surge in corporate profits. He argues that this outcome is not the fault of AI itself but a consequence of the capitalist system, which incentivizes rich companies to replace workers with technology. This will make a few people much wealthier while making most people poorer, widening the economic divide. While large-scale layoffs have not yet occurred, evidence suggests AI is already reducing opportunities for entry-level positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix with the fastest lap in Formula 1 history, surpassing a 2020 record set by Lewis Hamilton. His average speed of 164.466mph was achieved due to a combination of the current cars' low-drag design and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track at Monza. The previous record was held by cars from a different regulatory era, generally considered to be faster overall. Verstappen expressed optimism about his chances in the race, despite the McLaren car's typical strength over longer distances.</p>
