          <p>President Trump's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have ignited a debate in Congress regarding the president's war powers. While some lawmakers, including Speaker Mike Johnson, argue that the president acted within his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief, others, like Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, are pushing for a vote on a war powers resolution to reassert Congress's role in declaring war. Democrats such as Hakeem Jeffries have criticized the administration for a lack of transparency and for not providing evidence of an imminent threat from Iran, raising questions about the justification for the strikes. The Trump administration is expected to brief all House and Senate lawmakers on the situation on Tuesday, amid ongoing debate over the legality and necessity of the military action. Optimism remains tempered as the situation unfolds. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles at the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were intercepted, and is considering further retaliatory measures. According to Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik, potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. military assets across the Middle East, attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare tactics such as terror and cyber attacks. The U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the region, with bases in countries like Qatar, Bahrain, and Iraq, while Iran's actions could have severe economic repercussions, particularly if it disrupts oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. National Terrorism Advisory System has warned of a heightened threat environment, emphasizing the potential for cyber attacks and state-sponsored terrorism. </p>

          <p>The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, was targeted by Iranian missiles in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Established in 1996, the base serves as the forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), overseeing military operations across a vast region. President Trump visited Al Udeid in May, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to defending its interests and partners, while the U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East, with bases and installations in countries including Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq. Despite the recent attack, which was reportedly intercepted, the base remains a crucial hub for U.S. military operations and regional stability. </p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran, but U.S. and Qatari authorities reported the missiles were intercepted without injuries. President Trump indicated the U.S. received prior warning of the attack, while Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, describing the missile strike as "devastating and powerful." The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, with Al Udeid Air Base serving as the forward headquarters for CENTCOM. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar issued and then lifted a shelter-in-place order, and Bahrain also temporarily closed its airspace, highlighting the heightened tensions in the region. </p>

          <p>NHS England will begin offering at-home HPV testing kits to women who have delayed or avoided cervical screening, beginning in January, to improve early detection of cervical cancer. The self-sampling kits, containing a vaginal swab, will be sent in discreet packaging with pre-paid postage to women aged 25-64 who are not up-to-date with their screenings. If HPV is detected, women will be invited for a follow-up appointment to check for cell changes. The initiative aims to address barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending traditional screenings, with a goal of increasing screening rates to 77% over three years. </p>

This agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over, according to Trump, while Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. The attack by Iran was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran on Saturday, and Trump stated that monumental damage was done to all nuclear sites in Iran. The situation remains fluid, and the ceasefire's durability is yet to be determined. </p>

Justice Sotomayor dissented, accusing the court of rewarding lawlessness and disregarding the due process rights of immigrants, while the Department of Homeland Security hailed the decision as a victory for American safety. The ruling allows the administration to proceed with deportations to third countries, despite concerns over the safety and human rights of those affected. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel told CNBC that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent threats following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. According to Braziel, Iran has threatened to close the Strait during major conflicts for over 20 years but has never followed through due to its own economic interests, as it exports 1.7 million barrels a day through the Strait. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products. If Iran were to close the strait, the loss of so many barrels would make U.S. exports more valuable. (not investment advice)</p>

Animal welfare charity Blue Cross has seen a 264% increase in applications for financial assistance, and a survey by Cats Protection found that 58% of cat owners do not visit the vet as often as they would like due to cost. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices. </p>

Following the strikes, Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, urging both countries to pursue peace, echoing Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where advance notice was also given.

          <p>The Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party in Japan known for its anti-immigrant stance and calls for rewriting the postwar Constitution, is gaining traction among younger Japanese citizens. Amid economic discontent and rising tourism, Sanseito supporters express concerns about preferential treatment for foreigners and the rapid transformation of Japanese culture. Supporters blend nationalism with frustration over daily life, with some advocating for a return to wartime slogans. The party's early support can be attributed in part to pandemic fatigue and opposition to mask mandates, as well as the charismatic leadership of party leader Sohei Kamiya. </p>

The fire forced the cancellation of all trains through Manchester Oxford Road station, and the public was urged to avoid the area, while Manchester City Council provided overnight accommodation for those without alternative housing. The fire-hit building, also known as Medlock Mill, was slated for regeneration into a 36-story student tower. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missiles aimed at a U.S. base in Qatar, but President Trump claimed all parties had agreed to a ceasefire. Trump characterized Iran's response as "very weak" and expressed hope that Iran would pursue peace, signaling a potential de-escalation, and his initial reaction suggests he is inclined to hold his fire in hopes that the Iranians will be willing to negotiate in earnest. This approach mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iranian retaliation, but the situation remains sensitive, and the ultimate outcome depends on whether the ceasefire holds and further attacks are avoided. </p>

          <p>The U.S. health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to change prior authorization practices, a common and often criticized process where insurers require patients to seek approval before receiving medical treatment. The voluntary measures aim to standardize the approval process, expedite decisions, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, and increase transparency through a public dashboard. While officials expressed hope for the agreement, some, like Dr Greg Murphy, remained skeptical about insurers' commitment and questioned whether the measures were merely for placating an audience. Notably, insurance companies made a similar pledge in 2018, but the American Medical Association argued that insurers failed to uphold their end of the bargain. </p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies and subsequent price increases, while the price of West Texas Intermediate crude initially jumped but then fell as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz. Iran's parliament approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council, and a closure of the Strait, through which roughly 20% of the world's daily oil supply passes, could send prices soaring. Experts suggest that ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production in Iraq. U.S. drivers are likely to see higher gas prices in the short term, with potential increases of 10 to 15 cents per gallon. </p>
