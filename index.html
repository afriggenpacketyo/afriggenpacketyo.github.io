Disney's imagineers will lead creative design and operational oversight, with Miral handling full development and construction. The development is not part of Disney's $60 billion investment in its theme parks over the next decade, with Disney benefiting from royalties.

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has defended the company's decision to increase in-office requirements to three days a week and alter sabbatical eligibility, despite facing criticism from employees. Khosrowshahi stated that these changes are necessary for improved collaboration, innovation, and company culture, emphasizing the need for Uber to be at its "A game" as a "Gen-AI powered company." Some employees questioned whether the changes were intended to reduce attrition, but Khosrowshahi denied any cost-cutting motives. Uber reported first-quarter results that exceeded earnings expectations but fell short on revenue, with shares declining following the report.</p>

          <p>Tesla's Shanghai factory experienced a significant drop in deliveries in April, signaling increasing challenges in the Chinese electric vehicle market. Deliveries decreased by 25.8% from March and 6% year-over-year, with customers increasingly opting for cheaper, tech-laden domestic models. This decline follows a period of fluctuating sales earlier in the year, as Tesla faces fierce competition and aggressive pricing strategies from Chinese rivals. Tesla's first-quarter deliveries also hit a three-year low, underscoring the company's struggle to maintain its market share in China.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is predicted to reenter Earth's atmosphere around May 10, 2025, after a failed Venus mission. Experts estimate the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, and Europe. While the risk of impact is small, there is a slight chance the spacecraft could hit someone or something upon reentry. Experts suggest that if the heat shield fails, the spacecraft will burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, however, if the heat shield holds, it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.</p>

The strikes and subsequent exchanges of fire have resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, further straining relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

Brady encouraged Sanders to focus on his performance and leadership once he gets to the Browns, noting that many successful players were not high draft picks.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Russia adds symbolic weight to the relationship between the two countries, but the subsequent developments could be more significant. Observers caution that Beijing faces an unsustainable balancing act, strengthening ties with Moscow amid the Ukraine war while attempting to foster closer relations with Europe. Xi is set to attend the May 9 military parade in Red Square, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy in the US has surged to unprecedented levels, with solar, wind, and geothermal power more than tripling over the past decade, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, this progress faces increasing resistance as the Trump administration dismantles federal policies and spending aimed at easing the climate crisis. Nearly $8 billion in investments, including 16 large-scale factories, were canceled, closed, or downsized in the first three months of 2025, signaling market uncertainty and debate over clean energy incentives.</p>

          <p>Germany's new coalition government aims for climate neutrality by 2045, but experts suggest that environment and climate protection are not high priorities. The government's shuffle involves moving domestic and international climate policy back under the environment ministry, potentially leading to conflicts with economic goals. With the economy as a major focus, the new government faces challenges in balancing climate action with the needs of its industrial sector.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly in talks with Rwanda about taking in expelled migrants, drawing parallels to the UK's failed attempt to deport asylum seekers to the African nation. The British plan, which cost nearly a billion dollars, faced legal challenges and proved largely unworkable, with only a handful of migrants voluntarily sent. The New York Times article highlights potential challenges for the US, including high costs, Rwanda's limited capacity, and legal hurdles, referencing a previous Israeli deal where migrants sent to Rwanda disappeared.</p>

          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora has cautioned that proposed U.S. tariff hikes could lead to significant price increases across the affordable jewelry industry. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% levies are manageable, reverting to previously announced "reciprocal" rates would be game-changing for manufacturers reliant on Asian production. Pandora, known for its charm bracelets, depends heavily on manufacturing in Asia, and these tariffs could impact consumer pricing.</p>

          <p>Former FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler discusses the impact of new GLP-1 anti-obesity medications, highlighting their potential to revolutionize weight loss by modifying addictive brain pathways activated by ultraformulated foods. Kessler emphasizes that these drugs are not a panacea and should be combined with healthier eating, exercise, and behavioral therapies. He also calls for greater transparency in food labeling and dietary guidance tailored to those with insulin resistance, arguing that GLP-1s offer hope for improving public health by addressing the metabolic damage caused by engineered foods.</p>
