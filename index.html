          <p>Intel's first-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, but the company issued a disappointing forecast and revealed plans to reduce operational and capital expenses under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. This news led to a 7% drop in the stock price during extended trading. Tan emphasized that these cuts, including job reductions particularly in management, are necessary to regain market share and drive sustainable growth, however the exact number of job cuts is not yet finalized. The company's data center group showed growth, while the PC chip business declined. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked key provisions of President Trump's executive order on election integrity, specifically those requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration. The judge ruled that the Constitution grants Congress and the states, not the President, the authority to regulate federal elections. This decision follows lawsuits filed by multiple groups challenging the order's legality. The ruling also struck down a provision requiring federal agencies to assess citizenship status before offering voter registration to public assistance recipients.</p>
