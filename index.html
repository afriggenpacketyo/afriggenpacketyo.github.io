          <p>In a slugfest between the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cubs emerged victorious with an 11-10 win in 10 innings. Shota Imanaga, the Cubs' pitcher, had a rocky start, allowing three home runs and six hits over 5-2/3 innings, resulting in a no-decision. Despite Imanaga's struggles, the Cubs' offense, including a two-run double by Seiya Suzuki and a game-tying home run by Miguel Amaya, kept them in the game. Shohei Ohtani, playing for the Dodgers, went hitless in two games since returning from paternity leave, striking out three times. This game showcased both offensive firepower and pitching challenges for both teams.</p>

          <p>In a tragic incident in Indian-controlled Kashmir, at least 26 people were killed and 17 others wounded when gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in the town of Pahalgam.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures reveal that the UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations in the past year, reaching £151.9 billion due to higher spending on public sector pay and benefits. This figure is significantly above the £137.3 billion forecast by the UK's official forecaster, impacting the government's fiscal position. The figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to attend IMF and World Bank meetings amidst concerns over tariffs and sluggish economic growth, with the IMF downgrading the UK's growth forecast to 1.1%. The government aims to improve living standards through economic growth, but faces challenges from higher taxes and rising household bills, leading to calls for potential spending cuts and tax rises to meet fiscal rules.</p>

          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded, with key US officials no longer participating, amidst speculation of a potential halt to the invasion along current front lines in exchange for concessions.

Despite Putin's announcement of a temporary Easter ceasefire, reports indicate continued attacks, and the conflict has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of Ukrainian refugees.

          <p>According to reports, the United States has proposed a peace agreement that would unofficially recognize regions taken over by Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The proposal, presented last week, involves the US revoking sanctions imposed on Russia since 2014 and returning a portion of the Kharkiv region to Ukraine. Additionally, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be considered Ukrainian territory but operated by the US while supplying electricity to both Ukraine and Russia.

          <p>A recent report reveals that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change. This widespread bleaching event, the fourth global occurrence since 1998, poses a severe threat to coral ecosystems, increasing the risk of disease and starvation for the affected corals. Scientists emphasize the urgent need to address the root cause of climate change by reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels to protect coral reefs and the marine life they support. The loss of coral reefs would have significant consequences for human livelihoods and global biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Conor Benn is set to face Chris Eubank Jr. at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after a two-and-a-half-year legal battle following a failed drug test. The fight was initially scheduled for October 2022 but was called off due to Benn's positive test for Clomifene, a fertility drug. Benn maintains his innocence and has been cleared to fight, although the circumstances of the drug's presence in his system remain a mystery. The upcoming bout is considered the biggest fight of Benn's career, as he aims to overcome past adversity and the lingering shadow of his failed drugs test.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to decrease his involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative after Tesla reported a significant drop in profits and revenue for the first quarter of 2025. The company's sales slumped amidst a backlash against Musk's political role in the White House, leading him to acknowledge that his focus had shifted away from Tesla. Musk's political involvement, including substantial contributions to Trump's re-election, has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla, prompting him to reduce his time allocation to Doge. The company's financial performance was also affected by Trump's tariffs on China, highlighting the challenges Tesla faces in a rapidly evolving trade environment.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at four-year lows in March, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, as the country gears up for a general election on May 3. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributed the headline inflation to increases in the costs of food and private transport. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, slowed to 0.5%, prompting Singapore to ease its monetary policy for the second consecutive time in April. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged cost-of-living pressures as a real concern, citing global factors such as wars and trade disputes, while the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025.</p>
