          <h2>Trump Administration Announces 50% Tariff on Copper Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 13:36:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Announcing new protectionist measures, President Donald Trump stated his administration will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports. The move, which was revealed during a Cabinet meeting, caused copper prices to surge to a record high. Trump also indicated that steep tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, potentially as high as 200%, are forthcoming, though companies may have a grace period to move production to the U.S. This action is part of a broader strategy of sector-specific duties aimed at bolstering domestic industries.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tax bill signed by President Trump, promoted as providing major tax relief for seniors, does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits as some administration communications suggested. Tax experts clarify that the bill's primary mechanism is a new, temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors, which primarily benefits middle-income retirees and reduces, rather than eliminates, their tax liability. While the deduction may indirectly lower taxes on benefits for some, it does not alter the underlying structure of how benefits are taxed. Critics also note the changes could weaken Social Security's long-term funding by reducing its tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior White House economic advisor, Stephen Miran, downplayed the likelihood of President Trump's tariffs causing significant inflation, comparing the odds to rare events like pandemics or meteor strikes. Speaking on CNBC, Miran acknowledged that prediction is difficult but stated there is currently no evidence of widespread price hikes resulting from the trade policies. He promoted a White House council report showing a decrease in imported goods prices, although critics note many severe tariffs have been delayed. Economists still anticipate price increases as the full effects of the tariffs materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in a new budget bill establishes "Trump accounts," government-seeded investment vehicles for children born between 2025 and 2028. These accounts will receive an initial $1,000 government contribution, with parents and employers able to contribute additional post-tax funds. While financial experts see the initial grant as "free money," they note that existing options like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals like education or retirement. The accounts are designed to encourage early investment, with funds growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Justice Department and FBI memo concluding there is no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" has sparked significant backlash from President Trump's base. Prominent MAGA-aligned figures have criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, with some calling for resignations and accusing the administration of a cover-up. The frustration stems from prior promises to release more information and Bondi's previous comments that were interpreted as confirming a list's existence. This reaction marks a notable instance of vocal criticism directed at Trump's administration from his own loyal supporters.</p>

As a massive search and recovery effort continues, officials are facing scrutiny over the adequacy and timing of their emergency warnings.

Trump had sued over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris, claiming biased editing, a charge CBS denied.

This data aligns with a period of more conciliatory trade negotiations and suggests that widespread price hikes have not yet materialized in official inflation readings.

This new interpretation of the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment came as part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious broadcasting groups. The filing argues that when a house of worship speaks to its congregation on electoral politics through the lens of faith, it does not constitute intervention in a political campaign. This move aligns with President Trump's long-standing call to repeal the amendment, which has historically barred such endorsements.</p>

          <p>In The Atlantic's "Dear James" column, writer James Parker responds to a 19-year-old reader expressing a fear of dying alone. Parker validates the reader's anxiety, acknowledging that today's youth face existential dread at an early age. He reframes the fear of isolation by arguing that humans are fundamentally and unstoppably connected to one another and the world, even when they feel alone. He advises the reader to embrace their autonomy, get out into the world, and revel in experience, assuring them that by taking action, people will show up for them.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room revealed a history of violence within her unconventional three-person relationship, or "throuple." Seiden was found beaten to death after a road trip with her partners, Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo, who testified Abell also committed sexual assault. At Abell's trial, Araujo, who had taken a plea deal, testified that Abell led the brutal attack in a drunken rage. Abell's defense argued that Araujo was the sole killer, driven by jealousy. Ultimately, Abell was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Amid the tragedy of the Camp Mystic flood in Texas, stories of heroism have emerged, crediting teenage counselors and a U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer with saving dozens of lives. Counselors reportedly wrote campers' names on their skin for identification and threw children through windows to escape the rising water. Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Ruskan, on his first rescue mission, is credited with saving over 165 people by triaging and evacuating children and staff from the devastated campsite. He praised the young counselors for their "really heroic stuff" in the face of the disaster.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the flash floods in central Texas has climbed to at least 107, with search efforts hampered by forecasts of more rain. Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and staff were among the deceased. In the aftermath, critics have questioned whether budget cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, could have hindered the disaster response. The White House has rejected this, calling the flood an "act of God" and stating the NWS did its job by issuing timely warnings.</p>

The man, whose identity was confirmed by DNA tests after an anonymous tip, was taken from his mother and likely given to a family loyal to the regime.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's new tax and spending bill suggests its significant cuts to Medicaid could have a varied impact on the pharmaceutical industry. While Medicaid represents a smaller portion of revenue for most drugmakers, some companies have higher exposure. According to Leerink Partners, companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead, whose key products for cystic fibrosis and HIV are heavily used by Medicaid patients, are more reliant on the program. The financial impact is not immediate, as major cuts are not expected until 2027, and the bill also contains a provision beneficial to drugmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey suggests many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on feelings about the economy. This has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to "revenge saving," as economic anxiety fuels a desire to build emergency funds. Financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions and recommend a more intentional approach. They suggest savers start by assessing their financial situation, using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings goals first, and automating contributions to appropriate accounts for long-term security.</p>
