          <p>A father in South Dakota has raised concerns about the safety and fairness of allowing a transgender softball pitcher, who is biologically male, to compete in girls' sports in Minnesota. He emphasizes the significant size and strength differences between male and female athletes, highlighting potential safety risks due to the close proximity of the mound to the plate and the reaction times involved. The father also criticizes the lack of transparency, arguing that teams should be informed when they are competing against a player who was born male. He urges leadership within softball organizations to step up and protect female athletes, citing the original intent of Title IX and the need for clear policies rooted in biology rather than ideology.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction, escalating a clash between local authorities and the Trump administration over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of helping Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported, evade ICE agents by escorting him and his lawyer through a back door of her courtroom. Dugan's attorneys argue that she is entitled to judicial immunity and that the charges are unconstitutional, while prosecutors maintain she acted improperly after being alerted to the agents' presence in the courthouse. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>

          <p>President Trump, during a speech in Saudi Arabia, denounced Western intervention and nation-building, a statement met with applause from his audience but also skepticism from some observers. He asserted that the U.S. would no longer lecture other nations on how to live, urging the people of the Middle East to chart their own destinies. While some welcomed the shift away from perceived American overreach, others worried about the potential consequences of reduced U.S. pressure on human rights issues. Trump's remarks came at the start of a tour through Gulf Arab states focused on business deals and diplomatic objectives, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and seeking a deal with Iran over its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed pausing the enrollment of additional low-income immigrants without legal status in the state's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, starting in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit and higher-than-expected program costs. Those already enrolled will not be disenrolled, but starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will be required to pay a $100 monthly premium. Newsom attributes the budget shortfall to federal tariff policies and emphasizes that California will continue to provide more support for immigrants than any other state.

Anti-abortion leaders intend to use the analysis to push for restrictions on mifepristone, including ending telemedicine prescriptions, as part of a plan called "Rolling Thunder."

          <p>The Trump administration intends to deport Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard researcher, back to Russia, despite her fears of arrest due to her history of political protest. Petrova was detained after failing to declare scientific samples she was carrying in her luggage, leading to criminal smuggling charges. Her lawyer argues that the charges are intended to justify her deportation and that she was unlawfully detained. The case has drawn attention from scientists and academics, who view it as an escalation in the government's immigration policies and a potential threat to academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Despite facing a significant budget shortfall and potential federal penalties, California Governor Gavin Newsom has committed to maintaining state-funded healthcare for undocumented immigrants. The decision comes as Congress considers legislation that would penalize states for providing such coverage, potentially costing California billions of dollars. While Newsom has proposed some cuts to the program, including capping enrollment and adding a monthly premium, he emphasized the state's commitment to supporting its undocumented residents. The move highlights California's distinct approach to immigration and healthcare policy and sets the stage for a potential clash with the federal government.</p>

Democratic leaders opposed the move, arguing that it was impractical with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress.
