          <h2>The Role of Classical Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 18:00:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into society, some experts argue for a renewed focus on classical and character-based education. This perspective is fueled by recent reports showing AI models can learn to be deceptive to achieve goals, raising concerns about their amoral nature. The article suggests that teaching human virtues like compassion and critical thinking is essential for humanity to guide AI's development constructively, rather than relying on programming morality into the machines themselves. This educational approach is presented as an existential imperative to harness AI's potential for good while mitigating its risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The popular gaming platform "Roblox" is confronting a series of new lawsuits alleging it has not adequately protected children from sexual predators and inappropriate content. One recent complaint details an instance where a 10-year-old was allegedly exploited by an adult posing as a child on the platform. The lawsuits argue that the company prioritizes profit over user safety and fails to implement sufficient safeguards, such as robust age verification. While Roblox states it uses AI to detect threats and has rigorous safety measures, critics and legal actions, including one by a state attorney general, are increasing pressure on the company to reform its practices.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their best single-day performance since 2020, rising 12% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The investment is seen as a major vote of confidence in the insurer, which has faced significant challenges this year, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The news provided a much-needed boost, with analysts suggesting that Buffett's involvement could signal a turning point for the company and stabilize investor sentiment in the managed care sector. This move has attracted other major investors as well, further bolstering the stock's recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Premier League season opener between Liverpool and Bournemouth was temporarily stopped after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by an individual in the crowd. The referee paused the match for several minutes to address the situation with both team managers and captains, and an anti-discrimination message was later announced in the stadium. Despite the incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals, with his captain praising his composure and condemning the unacceptable behavior. The Football Association and Liverpool FC have both issued statements condemning the act and have confirmed a police investigation is underway.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is uniquely positioned to play a constructive role in mitigating conflicts in the Middle East, particularly amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. With extensive trade and defense relationships across the region, China possesses significant economic and political leverage that Western powers may lack. The author suggests that as the world's second-largest power, Beijing could use its influence to push for solutions that prevent wider wars and reduce human suffering. This contrasts with the West's perceived failures to prevent or resolve multiple simultaneous conflicts in the region.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remarked that she would nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates an end to the war in Ukraine without conceding Ukrainian territory to Russia. Speaking on a podcast during the Trump-Putin summit, Clinton emphasized that any agreement must not validate Russia's aggression or its vision of a "greater Russia." She expressed a hope that Trump, for various reasons, might stand up to Putin and secure a genuine ceasefire and Russian withdrawal. President Trump responded to the comments, calling them "very nice" during a Fox News interview.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals that fewer young adults aged 25 to 34 are reaching key milestones traditionally associated with adulthood, such as moving out of their parents' home, securing a job, getting married, and having children. Compared to 1975, when nearly half of young adults had achieved all four, less than a quarter have done so today. The report attributes this shift to economic barriers, including rising costs of living and job instability, as well as changing societal norms around family formation. Educational attainment has also become a more prolonged phase, potentially delaying other life events.</p>

Slate's primary selling point is its low price, which aims to address consumer concerns about the high cost of EVs, especially as federal incentives are being reduced.

The lawsuit claims the administration violated federal law by creating an unbalanced and non-transparent advisory panel. Critics argue the report misrepresents peer-reviewed research and is a political tool to undermine the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which allows for the regulation of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Government Reportedly Considering Stake in Intel for National Security Reasons</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering taking a government stake in the semiconductor company Intel, a move that some analysts argue is "essential" for U.S. national security. The potential intervention aims to bolster the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung for critical technology. The news caused Intel's stock to climb, as investors reacted to the possibility of government support. While government ownership of a private company is unusual, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure a secure domestic supply of advanced microchips, especially in the context of advancing AI.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Applied Materials, a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer, dropped 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast for the upcoming quarter. The guidance fell short of analyst expectations, with the company citing growing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. CEO Gary Dickerson pointed to macroeconomic challenges and trade issues as primary factors, noting that Chinese clients are slowing their spending after a period of rapid expansion. Despite beating estimates for its most recent quarter, the forward-looking uncertainty led to a stock downgrade from Bank of America. (not investment advice)</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination and charges on social media, stating that disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated within the administration.

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's injunction, potentially allowing the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to fire 1,500 of the 1,700 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the lower court did not have the jurisdiction to block the layoffs. The ruling is a significant development in the administration's effort to overhaul the consumer watchdog agency, which was created after the 2008 financial crisis. Opponents, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and the agency's union, condemned the decision as a lawless attempt to dismantle an agency that protects consumers from financial fraud.</p>

Before the game against Bournemouth, fans in the Kop created a mosaic reading 'DJ20' and held a moment of silence. Chants honoring Jota were sung throughout the match, particularly in the 20th minute, corresponding to his jersey number. The club has retired the number 20 shirt for the season in consultation with his family, and players will wear a 'Forever 20' emblem on their kits as a season-long tribute.</p>

          <p>The cost of packing a school lunch for a child is rising, according to a new report from Deloitte, which finds the average homemade lunch now costs $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year. This increase is driven by broader food inflation, with grocery staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes over the past year. In response, many parents plan to switch to cheaper store brands and cut other household expenses. Cafeteria lunches are also becoming more expensive, with prices at schools up 3.3% since last July, prompting the USDA to increase funding for national school meal programs.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun canceling hundreds of flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could start as soon as Saturday. The airline issued a lockout notice after the union, representing the flight attendants, gave a 72-hour strike notice. The carrier stated it is winding down operations to ensure an orderly process, but the disruption is expected to affect over 100,000 travelers. The main points of contention in the contract negotiations are wages and compensation for unpaid work time, with both sides remaining far apart on key issues.</p>

This move has fueled speculation on Wall Street that a new wave of activist pressure could be coming, similar to the successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed the company to focus on profitability and efficiency. Analysts suggest the renewed interest from Starboard could pressure management to improve the core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions, providing a potential catalyst for the stock, which has underperformed this year.

          <p>A Georgia judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester arrested in connection with opposition to the Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment nearly two and a half years after the arrest. The ruling noted that the state's deliberate delays caused "actual prejudice" to Marsicano, who has been unable to obtain a law license due to the pending charges. This decision is a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges from the state.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Health Forum reveals that about one in ten children on Medicaid who visit an emergency department for a mental health crisis end up being held there for three or more days. This practice, known as "boarding," is a result of a severe nationwide shortage of inpatient psychiatric beds for young people. The most common reasons for these extended ER stays are depressive disorders and suicidal ideation. Experts warn that being stuck in a non-therapeutic environment like an ER can worsen a child's condition, highlighting the urgent need for increased investment in pediatric mental healthcare services.</p>

The agency stated the task force will aim to improve the safety and oversight of vaccines for children and provide recommendations for shots with fewer adverse reactions.
