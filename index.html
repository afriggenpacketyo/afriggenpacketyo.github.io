          <p>Thieves disguised as construction workers executed a daring and meticulously planned heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, making off with at least nine pieces of jewelry from the Napoleon and French crown collections. The perpetrators used a mobile freight elevator to breach a second-floor window, then smashed display cases to steal items like crowns, necklaces, and earrings before escaping on motorcycles in under seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the theft as an attack on national heritage, pledging efforts to recover the "inestimable" items and bring the culprits to justice. Security experts highlighted the audacity of the crime, noting the thieves' professional approach and the significant challenge of recovering items likely to be dismantled for the black market, posing a major blow to museum security worldwide.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, offered insights into Chinese innovation, the US-China rivalry, and the role of women in leadership. She contended that the economic impact of rising global trade protectionism, particularly US tariffs, on China is often overstated, as exports to the US now represent only a small fraction of China's GDP. Qian highlighted that the broader US-China rivalry encompasses technology, ideologies, and global collaboration, warning of its potential harm if unhealthy competition persists. She also stressed the critical importance of women's voices in policymaking, advocating for greater gender equality and diverse perspectives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 17:53:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ordered X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI to remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies' "at best minimal connections" to the area. Judge Mark Pittman, in an ironic order, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, implicitly criticizing the practice of "forum-shopping" for favorable rulings. The lawsuit alleges an anticompetitive scheme where Apple favors OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store, deprioritizing rivals like xAI's Grok. Pittman noted that neither Apple nor OpenAI requested a venue transfer, and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has set a high standard for such transfers, influencing his decision to keep the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area utilized by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The agency found "items of interest" during a pre-arrival sweep, including what appeared to be a hunting stand set up high in a tree, though it had reportedly been there for months and lacked a direct line of sight to Trump's movements. Multiple sources indicated no impact on presidential movements, and no individuals were present at the location. The discovery prompts heightened security awareness, especially given a previous assassination attempt near Trump's Mar-A-Lago club last year, underscoring ongoing vigilance for presidential protection.</p>

Erhurman pledged to reinvigorate stalled UN talks on reunifying Cyprus through a federal solution, a stance long supported by the United Nations but opposed by Tatar and Turkey. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Erhurman, while also reaffirming support for Turkish Cypriot sovereign rights. Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides also congratulated Erhurman, committing to resuming peace talks, thereby raising hopes for a breakthrough in the island's nearly 50-year division.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Los Angeles diverted to Salt Lake City after pilots discovered a crack in one layer of the windshield. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, and the multilayer windshield, designed to function even with damage to one layer, is being sent to a laboratory for examination. Investigators will determine if an object struck the Boeing 737 mid-flight and review flight data and pilot accounts. All 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely, with another aircraft completing their journey, underscoring the effectiveness of aviation safety protocols and crew response in managing unexpected in-flight issues.</p>

          <p>A spectacular robbery at the Louvre Museum, the most significant since the Mona Lisa's disappearance in 1911, has prompted serious questions about French art security. Professional thieves used a truck with an elevating platform and disc-cutters to breach the Apollo Gallery, stealing eight 19th-century royal jewels, including diadems and necklaces from various empresses and queens. One crown was recovered damaged after being dropped during their seven-minute escape. The article highlights that criminal gangs target convert-to-cash items like jewels, not famous paintings, and notes two recent museum thefts that had already alerted authorities to growing audacity, leading to a new national security plan.</p>

          <p>Atlanta United fired coach Ronny Deila after a disappointing 5-13-16 season, his first in charge, which saw the team win only one of its last 18 matches and finish 14th in the Eastern Conference. Despite high expectations following Deila's hiring as an MLS Cup-winning coach and significant player investments, the club's performance fell short. CEO Garth Lagerwey announced a global search for a replacement, stating that the team's standard of play was not met and that the club owes its fans a much better on-field product. Deila's tenure ended quickly, similar to his previous European club roles, marking another short-lived coaching stint.</p>

Jean-Pierre, who previously touted Biden's viability, decided to become an independent to fight for her beliefs without "blind loyalty" to a party she felt no longer deserved it.

This came as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed US forces attacked another vessel associated with a Colombian leftist rebel group, killing three.

Trump justified these ongoing attacks, which have killed at least 29, raising legal and ethical questions among experts and Democrats.

          <p>Longtime Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga was buried in a state funeral, an unprecedented honor for a non-president, capping days of national memorials. Odinga, who died in India at 80, was revered for his fight against autocratic rule, which included imprisonment and exile. Thousands gathered at his rural home for the ceremony, which passed peacefully after earlier memorial events saw five deaths due to a stampede and police gunfire. Kenyan President William Ruto vowed to honor a political pact signed with Odinga in March, which Ruto credited with helping "steady the country." Uncertainty remains, however, if Odinga's party will uphold the agreement.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are "actively looking into" a report that Prince Andrew asked a protection officer to find "dirt" on his sexual assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre, in 2011. The Mail on Sunday reported Andrew provided Giuffre's personal details to investigate her, just before a photo of them was published. This investigation follows Andrew's recent relinquishment of royal titles, a decision he attributed to ongoing accusations distracting from royal work, which Giuffre's family views as vindication for survivors. The incident adds to years of scandal surrounding Andrew's associations and conduct, further eroding his public standing and raising questions about the use of police resources.</p>
