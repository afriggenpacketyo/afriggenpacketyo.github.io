          <h2>China's Rising Bond Yields Despite Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-21 01:39:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists attribute the recent increase in China's government bond yields not to reflation, but to factors like currency stabilization efforts and capital flows.  Persisting deflationary pressures, however, are expected to keep borrowing costs low in the long term.  The situation reflects a complex interplay of economic forces and policy responses. <i>(not investment advice)</i><br></p>
