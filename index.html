        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, AI tools have significantly contributed to the spread of false claims and conspiracy theories across social media. A CBS News analysis found that X's AI chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect and generated altered images of the person of interest before an arrest was made. This event highlights the growing challenge of generative AI providing inaccurate information during rapidly unfolding news events, as the technology prioritizes probability over factual verification.</p>

          <p>A new report from Policy in Practice indicates that seven million UK households are missing out on an estimated £24 billion in unclaimed benefits and social tariffs. The primary barriers preventing people from accessing this support are identified as a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and social stigma. The article highlights how even small benefits, such as attendance allowances for pensioners, can make a significant difference for struggling families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A legal analyst has suggested that more individuals could be charged in connection with the assassination of Charlie Kirk, arguing that communications from the suspect, Tyler Robinson, point toward a potential conspiracy. The analyst, Phil Holloway, noted that if others knew of Robinson's intent or assisted him, such as by providing the rifle, they could be held criminally liable as co-conspirators. However, authorities in Utah have stated that they currently believe the suspect acted alone.</p>

          <p>New documents reviewed by Reuters indicate that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook designated her Atlanta property as a 'vacation home' on a loan estimate. This evidence appears to counter accusations from the Trump administration that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming two different properties as her primary residence. The revelation adds a new layer to the ongoing investigation and her lawsuit against the president's attempt to dismiss her from the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volkswagen is facing consumer backlash after announcing a subscription-based plan for certain features in its new ID.3 electric vehicle models. Owners will need to pay a monthly fee of approximately $22 to unlock the upper tier of the car's performance capabilities, a move that critics are calling an audacious monetization of a physical product. The plan has sparked widespread annoyance online, with many consumers expressing frustration with 'subscription fatigue' and vowing not to purchase vehicles with such models.</p>

          <p>U.S. health officials plan to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to study a potential link between vaccines and autism, a move directed by Health Secretary Robert F.

Critics question why federal funds are being allocated to reinvestigate a disproven hypothesis instead of being used for other pressing autism research.</p>

          <p>A major cyberattack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to halt production worldwide for nearly two weeks, costing the company an estimated £50 million so far. The prolonged shutdown is now threatening the financial stability of its vast network of suppliers, many of which are small to medium-sized businesses that depend heavily on JLR. There are growing concerns about widespread job losses, leading to calls for the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to prevent companies from going bankrupt.</p>

The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which sometimes compete for major government and business contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants being held there. The disruption, caused by a damaged underwater pipeline, affects the Migrant Operations Center and has renewed skepticism about the base's capacity to handle the large number of migrants the Trump administration intends to send. Critics argue the incident highlights that the base's infrastructure is inadequate and that holding migrants there is inefficient.</p>
