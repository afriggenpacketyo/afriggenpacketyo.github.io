          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail, Sterling Williams, has been arrested for allegedly aiding 10 inmates in their escape.

          <p>Home Depot plans to absorb tariff costs rather than raise prices for consumers, according to company executives. While some individual product options may disappear from shelves, the chain is leveraging its market power and diversified supply chain to maintain steady prices. The company has been pushing suppliers to diversify their sourcing since Trump imposed tariffs, aiming for no more than 10% of products from any single foreign country by mid-2026. This strategy aims to attract shoppers from competitors who are raising prices due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fully embraced the lab-leak theory of COVID-19's origins, despite lacking definitive proof. This stance has become a central tenet within the GOP, influencing policy decisions such as budget cuts to biomedical research. The administration's focus on the lab-leak theory has led to restrictions on scientific collaboration and funding, potentially hindering efforts to understand the pandemic's origins. This shift toward artificial certainty risks undermining the study of pandemic origins and alienating the scientific community.</p>
