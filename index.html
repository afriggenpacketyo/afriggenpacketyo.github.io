          <h2>Apple's New Software Design Sparks User Debate Over Aesthetics and Functionality</h2>

          <p>Apple's latest software redesign, dubbed Liquid Glass, has ignited controversy among users who find the translucent backgrounds difficult to read and see clearly. While some critics have voiced concerns about straying from Steve Jobs' original design principles, Apple is taking user feedback into account during the beta-testing phase. Apple Intelligence features, including AI-summarized notifications and the Clean Up tool for photos, have received mixed reviews, while the revamped Siri has faced delays. Despite facing lawsuits over false advertising related to Apple Intelligence, Apple executives are defending their measured approach to AI development, emphasizing privacy and user experience over rushing to market. The company aims to make the best version of new technology rather than being the first to release it, providing a safe haven from over-experimentation with AI, and allowing users to enjoy their iPhones without relying on half-formed AI tools. The new look is coming to all of the latest Apple devices in the fall. Optimism is tempered by user concerns and development delays.</p>

          <p>A man inside a leisure centre in County Antrim described the fear felt by customers and staff as rioters attacked the building, which was being used as emergency shelter for families fleeing violence. Northern Ireland Assembly Member Danny Donnelly reported that rioters threw a brick through a window during a yoga class and systematically broke windows, forcing staff to flee. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is facing financial strain, with policing the unrest potentially costing Â£3 million, and has requested support officers from Great Britain. The unrest has spread to multiple towns, and police are preparing for further violence. The situation is tense, with reports of petrol bombs and other weapons being used against officers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is requesting extensive election data from Colorado, including all records related to the 2024 federal elections and preservation of records from the 2020 election. Voting experts and officials have expressed concern over the unusual nature of the request, especially given President Trump's past false claims about elections. Recent polling shows conflicting public opinion on Trump's deportation policies, indicating unpredictability and potential for swaying public sentiment. The Trump administration also plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, a move criticized for undermining efforts to combat climate change. A Republican proposal aims to penalize colleges with students who leave with unmanageable student loan debt, potentially saving the government billions over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has authorized National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to temporarily detain anti-ICE rioters who attack ICE law enforcement officers. The troops are providing protection for ICE agents and other federal law enforcement groups. California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly feuded with the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard. The Trump administration asserts its ICE operations aim to remove "criminal illegal immigrant killers, sexual assaulters, gangbangers, drug dealers, human traffickers and domestic abusers off the streets."</p>

Nomura economists predict subdued CPI for fiscal year 2026, citing softened commodity prices and influx of cheap Chinese goods.

          <p>Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging President Trump to reverse course on the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut government spending, following a public dispute between Trump and Elon Musk. Warren, along with Representative Melanie Stansbury, outlined DOGE's failures and proposed alternative recommendations that could save over $2 trillion in 10 years. Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen, eliminating waste in federal charter school programs, reforming the estate tax exemption, and negotiating better Defense Department contracts. The letter comes after Musk's opposition to a budget bill central to Trump's agenda led to a public feud, despite Musk initially pledging to cut significant government spending.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services is raising concerns about rising consumer debt, with some users accumulating significant debt through multiple BNPL loans. Consumer advocates warn that BNPL can lead people to overspend and take on more debt than they can afford, especially as BNPL companies partner with major retailers to offer installment payment options. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has eased regulations on BNPL companies, prompting concerns about consumer protections. Research indicates that BNPL users are more likely to have higher balances on other forms of credit and may be substituting BNPL payments for other financial obligations. Data shows that BNPL is used more by Americans with lower credit scores and those with lower incomes, with a significant percentage using it to afford necessities like groceries.</p>

          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans found that the collective rituals of the day, such as flares, fireworks, and singing, were more emotionally intense than the actual game. The article argues that football should be understood as a collective ritual, a public theater of identity, and a long-running participatory soap opera, with the game itself being just one element. Watching football elicits a diversity of emotions, and neurophysiology alone cannot capture the full experience. Football's collectivities and communitarian cultures offer a sense of belonging in an increasingly individualized world, generating comprehensible narratives and occasional moments of scintillating drama.</p>

          <p>A group of Jewish scholars argues that Harvard University is engaging in discriminatory practices by assuming all Jewish people share identical views about Israel and Zionism. They claim that Harvard's approach conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people, thereby erasing the diversity of Jewish thought and experience. This erasure has consequences for Jewish students and faculty who don't conform to Harvard's preferred stereotype, such as those who support Palestinian rights. The scholars call on Harvard and other universities to abandon efforts to enforce political orthodoxy in Jewish communities and to treat Jewish people as complex individuals capable of thinking for themselves. The scholars support Harvard's legal challenge to federal overreach but reject the university's characterization of its own censorship as necessary protection for Jewish students.</p>

          <p>Despite initial consternation from Israeli leaders, a new nuclear deal between the Trump administration and Iran could be the least bad option for Israel among a host of poor choices. While hard-line Israelis prefer the total dismantlement of Iran's centrifuges, analysts suggest that a negotiated settlement could allow Israel to build on its advantage by pursuing closer ties to Arab states. A deal that draws in Gulf states would better integrate Iran into the region's economy, potentially de-radicalizing its foreign policy. The alternative to a deal is a direct war between Iran and Israel, with unpredictable consequences, which is why even pro-Israel figures in the Iranian opposition oppose military strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is set to kick off in the United States with an expanded format, featuring 32 teams and generating significant revenue. However, the new format has faced criticism due to the already overcrowded football calendar and the potential for increased player injuries. The tournament's scheduling also conflicts with other major football events, such as the Gold Cup and the Women's Euros. Ticket sales have been slow, and the restrictive entry policies introduced by the Trump administration may deter some foreign fans from attending. The tournament opens on June 14 in Miami and concludes on July 13 in New York.</p>

Officials indicated that Israel was ready to launch an operation into Iran, prompting concerns that Iran could retaliate on US sites in Iraq.

Despite the evacuation, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to hold talks with Iran about its nuclear program on Sunday.
