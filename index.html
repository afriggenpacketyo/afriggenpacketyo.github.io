The 13.1-mile course from Newcastle to South Shields is lined with over 200,000 spectators cheering on the participants. Event founder Sir Brendan Foster noted the event's growing popularity, particularly among younger runners and women, with female participation rising from 8% in the first race to 49% last year. The event serves as a significant fundraiser for numerous charities and is an iconic cultural fixture for the North East of England.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his intention to step down, citing growing division within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The decision follows the LDP losing its parliamentary majority in a snap election last year and control of the upper house in July, creating significant political uncertainty. Ishiba stated that reaching a conclusion in trade negotiations with the United States, which resulted in new tariffs on Japanese goods, marked an appropriate time for his departure. He will remain in his role until a successor is chosen through an emergency party leadership vote.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 06:06:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged to new records, gaining approximately 35% this year to nearly $3,600 an ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during times of political and financial instability. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for investors to gain exposure is through gold bullion-backed ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than physical gold or mining stocks. However, advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to less than 3% of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey has stated that the government is exploring the use of military and other non-military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's pledge to stop using hotels for asylum housing, a practice that has become costly and controversial. Currently, over 32,000 asylum seekers are housed in hotels while their claims are processed. The move signifies an "all of government effort" and follows the previous government's use of former military bases like MDP Wethersfield and Napier Barracks for the same purpose.</p>

          <p>The charity Rainbow Railroad reports a 760% surge in inquiries from LGBTQ+ Americans seeking to relocate to Canada since Donald Trump's re-election. This increase is attributed to fears over rising anti-gay rhetoric and a wave of over 600 bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights across the United States. The organization received over 4,100 calls from the U.S. in the first eight months of the year, with a majority expressing a desire to leave due to the political climate. Recent Canadian immigration cases have sparked hope for some, potentially setting precedents for asylum claims based on persecution in the U.S.</p>

He argues that Murdaugh's indignant attitude when his reputation crumbled is similar to Bundy's outrage at being judged by those he considered his inferiors.

          <p>This summer's transfer window highlighted a significant financial disparity, with Premier League clubs spending £3 billion compared to La Liga's £592 million. This gap is not due to a lack of ambition but a strategic focus on financial sustainability implemented by La Liga in 2013. Strict economic controls, including salary caps, have transformed Spanish clubs from debt-ridden entities into stable enterprises, though it has reduced their spending power. Despite the financial gap, Spanish clubs remain highly competitive in European competitions, leveraging strong youth academies to maintain on-pitch success.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across parts of the UK this evening, causing the full Moon to take on a deep red hue, an effect known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. In the UK, the visibility of the full eclipse, which starts at 18:30 BST, will depend on the local moonrise time, with eastern areas getting the best view. Unlike solar eclipses, this event is safe to view directly without special equipment.</p>

          <p>Charles Robinson, the 24-year-old founder of water filtration company Water2, has seen his business grow from a university research project into a brand expecting to be in 1% of UK homes by year's end. After dropping out of a philosophy degree, he developed a self-installable water filter and found success using authentic social media videos to market the product. The company's profile was significantly boosted when adventurer Bear Grylls became a customer and subsequently a co-owner and investor. Robinson attributes the company's rapid growth to a focused mission and a direct-to-consumer digital strategy.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Appeasing Donald Trump is a Flawed Strategy for World Leaders</h2>

          <p>This opinion article by Simon Tisdall argues that world leaders who attempt to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fail to secure lasting benefits and often suffer reputational damage. The article cites examples like India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, whose relationships with Trump soured despite initial efforts at friendship. It warns UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer against his "Trump-whisperer" approach ahead of a state visit, suggesting it positions the UK as a subservient state. The author contends that resistance and strength are more effective tactics when dealing with Trump.</p>

          <h2>Disruption to Undersea Cables in Red Sea Impacts Internet in Asia and Middle East</h2>

          <p>Multiple undersea fiber optic cables in the Red Sea have been cut, causing internet disruptions and increased latency in parts of Asia and the Middle East. Companies including Microsoft and NetBlocks have confirmed failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. While the cause is unclear, there has been ongoing concern about potential targeting by Yemen's Houthi rebels, although they have previously denied such attacks. These subsea cables are crucial components of global internet infrastructure, and repairs can often take several weeks to complete.</p>
