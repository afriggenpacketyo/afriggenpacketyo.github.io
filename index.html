          <p>General Motors stock experienced the most significant decline among automakers in response to President Trump's new auto tariffs.  GM's greater reliance on vehicle imports from Mexico compared to competitors like Ford and Stellantis contributes to its increased vulnerability to these tariffs.  Analysts predict that GM may need to adjust its production strategies to mitigate the impact.</p>
