          <h2>Investigation Reveals Unethical Practices at Major UK Estate Agencies</h2>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has exposed questionable sales tactics at two prominent UK estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. An undercover reporter at Connells found evidence of staff prioritizing buyers who used the company's in-house mortgage services, potentially costing sellers a higher sale price. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower revealed a strategy of overvaluing properties to secure listings and then incentivizing staff to persuade sellers to lower the price. Both companies deny wrongdoing but the findings raise concerns about consumer protection in the property market.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian woman living in the UK was arrested after smuggling a baby girl from Nigeria, falsely claiming to have given birth. Investigations by the Family Court revealed the woman faked her pregnancy and used forged documents from a so-called "baby factory," a facility linked to kidnapping and sexual assault. Text messages indicated a financial transaction for the baby. The court ultimately ruled the child was not hers and placed the infant, who has been given a new identity, up for adoption.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang downplayed concerns that the company's advanced chips could be used by China's military, arguing that Beijing cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In an interview ahead of another trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to establishing American technology as the global standard. Despite billions in losses from the restrictions, Huang is navigating the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing, even as U.S. officials express skepticism about his claims.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has proposed a new rule requiring that air conditioners be manufactured with a minimum temperature setting of 20°C (68°F) to curb rising electricity consumption. With millions of AC units sold annually, officials estimate that for each degree the temperature is raised, energy savings of about 6% can be achieved. The measure aims to address the strain on the power grid, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, especially as AC use drives peak demand.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This economic rebound is partly attributed to a temporary pause in U.S.-China tariffs, which may have prompted businesses to front-load exports. Despite the positive figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing "significant uncertainty and downside risks" in the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when fields like international trade and urban planning were most popular.

          <p>Kwon Ping Ho, founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, observes that today's tourists are vastly different from those of 30 years ago. He notes that modern travelers, particularly younger generations, seek deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities rather than simple sightseeing. Ho also highlights the shift from predominantly Western tourists to a more diverse, "rainbow tourism" landscape with travelers from all over the world. This evolution requires the hospitality industry to move beyond one-size-fits-all offerings to meet more sophisticated demands.</p>

Macron described the current geopolitical climate as a "pivotal moment" and argued that to be free, a nation must be powerful.

While Orban has built his power by targeting liberal values, Magyar's center-right challenge is creating a new narrative of a declining Hungary.
