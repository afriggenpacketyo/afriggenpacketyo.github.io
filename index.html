          <p>Nvidia is reportedly planning to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip is Nvidia's attempt to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, after U.S. officials blocked the original H20 due to export license requirements. The new chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity, but customers may be able to adjust its performance. Nvidia declined to comment on the report, and the U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following first-quarter earnings that fell short of estimates. While revenue increased by 28% year-over-year to $2.24 billion and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed expectations due to production fluctuations that lowered average selling prices. SMIC anticipates this impact will extend into the second quarter, forecasting a sequential revenue decrease of 4% to 6%. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, with a capacity utilization rate of 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Some of Asia's wealthiest families are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets due to concerns about President Trump's tariffs and economic unpredictability. Several family offices and advisors to the ultra-rich are decreasing or freezing investments, particularly in U.S. equities and Treasuries, citing rapid policy shifts and recession risks. One family office managing assets for Chinese billionaires has exited its U.S. holdings entirely, shifting the proceeds to Asia.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while imports from the U.S. dropped nearly 14%. Conversely, exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations, and Indonesia and Thailand seeing substantial growth. The surge in overall exports may be partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by the U.S., domestic aluminum production has not been revived, mainly due to high electricity prices. While tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, rising electricity costs in the U.S. are leading to smelter closures instead of restarts. The 25% aluminum tariffs have significantly increased regional delivery premiums, with European premiums being over 30% lower, impacting downstream users who will likely face higher prices. The primary barrier to domestic smelting remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power contracts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expediting the resettlement of white South Africans, classified as refugees, while virtually halting other refugee admissions. The administration plans to welcome the first group of Afrikaners, claiming they are victims of racial persecution, with government officials present at Washington Dulles International Airport. The rapid processing of Afrikaners contrasts sharply with the long waits faced by other refugees. This move follows an executive order creating an exception for Afrikaners while cutting U.S. financial assistance to South Africa.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts State Police sergeant testified that he initially told authorities John O'Keefe may have been struck in the face with a bar glass, causing his injuries. This contradicts the prosecution's theory that Karen Read struck O'Keefe with her car and left him to die. The defense questioned the thoroughness of the initial crime scene investigation, highlighting that key witnesses may have lied about O'Keefe entering a house before his death.
