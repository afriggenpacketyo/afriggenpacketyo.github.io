          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences for a 1973 murder and federal charges in 1997. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude, highlighting Hoover's rehabilitation efforts despite facing decades in solitary confinement. However, the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment, emphasizing Hoover's ruthless control over a large-scale criminal enterprise from prison, including allegations of involving children in drug sales. Hoover's parole had been previously denied by the State of Illinois, where he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump does not have the power to impose tariffs unilaterally, striking down his global tariffs as "contrary to law." The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to levy tariffs. White House spokesman Kush Desai criticized the ruling, asserting that unelected judges should not decide how to address a national emergency. The ruling came in response to lawsuits filed by small businesses and Democratic attorneys general, who argued that the tariffs were unlawful and economically destructive.</p>

Hui's detention has sparked debate, with some residents expressing sympathy and support, while others maintain that illegal immigration should be strictly enforced.

          <p>President Trump has pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been serving prison sentences for bank and tax fraud since 2022. The couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of millions and concealing income from their reality TV show to avoid paying taxes. The Chrisleys had sought a presidential pardon, alleging misconduct by the government and false testimony from a key witness. Their lawyer claimed they were targeted due to their conservative views and high profile, and their daughter had publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended some sales of critical U.S. technologies, including those related to jet engines and semiconductors, to China in response to China's restrictions on exports of critical minerals to the United States. This move escalates the trade conflict between the two countries, potentially impacting companies that rely on foreign technologies. The new export restrictions are part of a broader review within the Commerce Department of exports of strategic goods to China. This action follows China's earlier suspension of exports of critical minerals and magnets, essential for various industries, after Trump's decision to increase tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

While the plane was intended as a replacement for Air Force One, Trump indicated it would instead be refitted for military standard and used by the United States Air Force. The original offer from Qatar drew criticism, with some calling it "the definition of corruption."

Trump expressed concern that about one-fourth of Harvard's student body is made up of international students, suggesting a cap of around 15 percent. He also raised questions about the origins and potential troublemaking tendencies of foreign students, while asserting the need for students who "can love our country."</p>

Consumer groups caution that the changes may not help renters or leaseholders, and the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier.

          <p>A judge has stated that the law used to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate, is likely unconstitutional. Khalil was targeted for deportation because the Trump administration said he impeded its foreign policy. Despite this, the judge declined to release Khalil, citing new allegations that he failed to disclose his membership in certain organizations when applying for permanent residency. The judge found that the use of the foreign policy law in Khalilâ€™s detention was most likely unconstitutional, but he stopped short of freeing Khalil.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether California, its interscholastic sports federation, and a school district are violating the civil rights of cisgender girls by allowing transgender students to compete in school sports. The Justice Department is also supporting a lawsuit alleging similar violations in another school district. These actions follow President Trump's threat to withhold federal funding from California for allowing transgender youth to participate in sports. The investigation will consider whether California's laws and policies violate Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on future employment, suggesting it could be the most important force in shaping the workforce. He referenced Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's warning that AI could increase unemployment by 10 to 20% and eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. While Cramer doesn't consider himself a "doomsayer," he believes it's important to quantify who will be replaced by AI and what will change with the widespread adoption of advanced chips. Cramer believes CEOs are primarily interested in using AI to cut costs by firing employees, rather than making them more productive.</p>

The girl suffers from short bowel syndrome and requires intravenous nutrition unavailable in Mexico. Attorneys are seeking to reverse the decision, arguing that deporting the family would be a moral failure and unlawful, and have filed a fresh application for humanitarian parole.</p>

Most veterinarians, however, argue that keeping potentially infected birds alive poses a public health threat. The farm owners have lost a legal battle to keep the birds alive, arguing they should be tested for antibodies to develop treatments for the virus.</p>
