        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential impact of secondary sanctions on Russia's economy under a second Trump administration. Despite existing Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, largely due to its shift to a war economy. However, economists predict a slowdown in growth. The article explores how secondary sanctions, targeting countries and companies that continue to do business with Russia, could further strain its economy. China and India, key trading partners of Russia, could be particularly affected, and the article also considers the role of Turkey in circumventing sanctions.</p>
