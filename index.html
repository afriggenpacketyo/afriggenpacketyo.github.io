          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a steep decline following the announcement of a $33 billion buyout deal by the Toyota Group to take the company private. This move comes amid growing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for their reduction. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries' shares, significantly lower than the previous day's closing price, and will involve the creation of a new holding company. This is a shift in corporate strategy as Toyota once used cross-shareholding to protect against acquisition threats. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that the party's message of tinkering around the edges does not resonate with working people, emphasizing the need to confront the billionaire class and advocate for policies like healthcare for all and tuition-free public colleges. Sanders highlights the importance of Democrats presenting a clear alternative to Trump's economic policies and authoritarian tendencies, focusing on issues such as income inequality and access to essential services.

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has successfully entered a 3:1 Earth-moon resonant orbit, a fuel-efficient path considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure. However, claims that it is the first spacecraft to achieve this feat have been challenged by US and Canadian experts, who point to NASA's IBEX probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory in China asserts that Tiandu-1's flight data will support advancements in orbit maintenance, control, and autonomous navigation in complex gravitational environments.

The increase, formalized through an executive order, excludes the United Kingdom, which maintains a 25% rate under a preliminary trade agreement. Canada and Mexico, major steel exporters to the U.S., are expected to be significantly affected, prompting negotiations for tariff removal.

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, expanding by 1.3% year-on-year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The growth was attributed to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports, with extreme weather events further impacting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth, and the GDP release could prompt further monetary policy easing. Despite this, labor costs continue to grow faster than the RBA's inflation target, potentially limiting the extent of future rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have been charged with smuggling a toxic fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the United States, with the intention of researching it at an American university. The fungus, classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon, causes head blight, a disease affecting wheat, barley, maize, and rice, leading to significant economic losses. The FBI alleges that the scientists conspired to smuggle the fungus, which can cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in humans and livestock. One of the scientists was previously turned away at the Detroit airport after changing his story about red plant material discovered in his backpack.</p>

Senior government watchdogs Dame Nicole Jacobs and Baroness Newlove jointly warned that victim support services are being pushed to the brink due to funding cuts and rising costs. This intervention comes ahead of the chancellor's spending review, which is expected to include cuts to public spending, raising concerns about the future of these essential services.

The article references research that defends the "China shock" claim, including a series of papers by economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson.
