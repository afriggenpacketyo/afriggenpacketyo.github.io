          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect allegedly used a folding knife in the attack, injuring victims aged 21 to 84 before being confronted by armed citizens and arrested by a deputy. While the motive remains under investigation with FBI assistance, all victims are expected to survive, with their conditions steadily improving. Free counseling is being offered to victims and community members affected by the violent incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to approximately 10 to 12 days. Citing a lack of progress, Trump expressed his disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin and warned of massive "secondary tariffs" on Moscow's trade partners if an agreement is not reached. The president stated he would likely formalize the revised deadline soon, arguing there is no reason to wait for a predetermined outcome. This move intensifies pressure on Moscow to end the ongoing conflict.</p>

Researchers showed participants VR avatars of faces, some of which appeared sick, and monitored their brain activity and blood samples. The results showed that viewing sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered an immune response involving innate lymphoid cells. This finding opens up potential therapeutic applications, such as using VR to modulate immunity or treat allergies through controlled exposure.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines co-pilot was arrested by federal agents at San Francisco International Airport on charges related to child sexual abuse materials. The arrest occurred Saturday night after the flight from Minnesota landed, with about 10 law enforcement officers boarding the plane to take the co-pilot into custody before passengers deplaned. A senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed that Homeland Security Investigations agents made the arrest. The co-pilot has not been publicly identified, and Delta Air Lines has referred inquiries to the DHS.</p>

          <p>NHS England has criticized the British Medical Association (BMA) for its "increasingly hardline" stance in rejecting requests for striking resident doctors to return to work for emergencies. During the latest five-day walkout over pay, the BMA has rejected 18 of 27 such requests, known as derogations, which are meant to ensure patient safety is not at risk. NHS officials expressed concern that a remote BMA panel was turning down critical requests, including for cancer care, and putting safety at risk. The BMA countered that hospitals were using the system to cover for poor planning and non-urgent care.</p>

          <p>To combat a demographic crisis marked by three consecutive years of population decline, the Chinese government will offer parents an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan ($500) per child under three. This national policy follows various provincial-level efforts to encourage child-rearing amid record-low marriage rates and high child-rearing costs. While analysts view the subsidy as a positive step, they caution that the amount is likely too small to significantly reverse the low birth rate or boost domestic consumption on its own. The number of births in China in 2024 was half the total from 2016.</p>

This article analyzes how clubs like Arsenal are now seeking dedicated No. 9s to convert chances, leading to a shuffle of top strikers like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres.

          <p>A new economic analysis indicates that America's fast-growing Sunbelt suburbs are on a trajectory to become prohibitively expensive, mirroring the housing crises of coastal cities. According to economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko, housing construction in metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted relative to their population growth, causing costs to surge. The slowdown is most pronounced in affluent suburbs, suggesting that incumbent residents are using regulations to block new development. The findings warn that the "suburban frontier" is closing, as the sprawl-based model for providing abundant housing is beginning to fail.</p>
