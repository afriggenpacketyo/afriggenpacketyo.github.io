          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose an extra 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat comes as the BRICS bloc, which recently expanded to include nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia, criticized U.S. protectionist measures during its summit. The group aims to challenge Western-dominated global institutions and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. The Trump administration is also preparing to send out letters detailing country-specific tariff rates, with new duties potentially taking effect on August 1. (not investment advice)</p>

She is one of at least 10 campers still missing from Camp Mystic after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas over the weekend. The tragedy has claimed at least 80 lives, with the camp experiencing significant losses, including its owner. Lytal shared a video of his daughter, calling her "absolutely fearless" as search and rescue operations continue in the flood-ravaged region.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a "client list" associated with deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein. The memo, ordered by Trump-appointed leadership, also states that investigators found no new evidence to charge any third parties in connection with Epstein's crimes. Additionally, officials released video footage that they say further confirms Epstein's 2019 death in jail was a suicide, aiming to counter widespread conspiracy theories. The review's findings are likely to disappoint those who anticipated further prosecutions of high-profile individuals.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The 50-year-old was also convicted of the attempted murder of a fourth relative who survived the July 2023 lunch. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests, while the defense claimed it was an accident, and that she lied to investigators out of panic. After a nine-week trial featuring over 50 witnesses, Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the crime.</p>

          <p>Investors and global markets are facing renewed uncertainty as the Trump administration sends mixed signals about its trade tariff deadlines. While a July 9 deadline was previously set, officials now suggest higher tariffs might not take effect until August 1, creating confusion about which countries and deals are affected. Former President Trump further complicated matters by threatening an additional 10% tariff on BRICS-aligned nations. This lack of clarity in U.S. trade policy, often announced through media interviews, has led to a cautious and slightly negative reaction in Asian and U.S. futures markets.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Elon Musk, stating he has gone "completely off the rails" after the tech billionaire announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." The move marks a definitive end to their political alliance, which soured over disagreements on a recent spending bill and the termination of electric vehicle tax credits. In a social media post, Trump dismissed the idea of a third party as a source of "disruption and chaos." Musk formed the party to challenge the two-party system, which he argues is failing the country.</p>

          <p>The United States and countries worldwide are experiencing a sustained and rapid decline in birth rates, a trend driven by increased economic independence for women and shifting societal values. Researchers note that the global fertility rate is at its lowest point ever recorded, leading to concerns about depopulation, aging workforces, and the long-term viability of social safety nets like Social Security. While some view a smaller human footprint as an environmental positive, economists and policymakers are grappling with the profound economic and social challenges posed by this demographic shift.

          <p>This article argues that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's severe housing crisis and a source of growing political disenfranchisement. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have poured trillions into residential real estate, treating homes as a lucrative asset class. This has inflated prices and rents, making housing unaffordable for working and middle-class citizens and fueling support for far-right parties. The author contends that this system, which prioritizes profit over residency, is systematically failing to provide a fundamental human need. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection into the inner ear, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial. The research, detailed in Nature Medicine, showed that all 10 participants with hearing loss caused by a mutated OTOF gene experienced significant improvement. The therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a healthy copy of the gene, restoring the protein needed to transmit sound signals to the brain. One seven-year-old girl regained nearly full hearing, and researchers are hopeful this safe method can be adapted for other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <p>Following his feud with former President Trump, Elon Musk's vow to create a new "America Party" confronts a daunting reality of legal, financial, and logistical challenges. This article explains that creating a new national political party is an exceedingly difficult task, even for a billionaire. The process involves navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties and often require enormous signature-gathering efforts. Any attempt would also face intense and costly legal challenges from the Republican and Democratic parties, making it a multi-year project.</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) has emerged as the primary force behind a surge of jihadist violence across West Africa's Sahel region, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017 as a coalition of militant groups, JNIM has expanded its operations and dramatically increased its attacks, claiming to have killed nearly 1,000 people since April. The group exploits local grievances and government instability to recruit fighters and funds its operations through cattle-rustling and taxation. This article details the group's origins, goals, and the failure of counterinsurgency efforts to contain its threat.</p>

          <p>In a joint statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, the BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global governance for artificial intelligence. The leaders described AI as a "unique opportunity" for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair oversight. They stressed the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust and security. The statement also advocated for open-source collaboration and ensuring that developing nations in the Global South have equal access to AI technologies.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp on the Guadalupe River in Texas, was devastated when a torrential downpour caused the river to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The "horrific" deluge swept through low-lying cabins where hundreds of girls were sleeping, turning a place of adventure and prayer into a scene of destruction. The camp's director and several young campers were among the dozens killed in the flood. Survivors describe terrifying scenes of being evacuated by military trucks as they witnessed the camp being ripped apart, with first responders pulling girls from the raging water.</p>

          <p>A recent round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt in Doha, has concluded without achieving a breakthrough. While messages were exchanged, significant gaps remain between the two sides' positions. Hamas continues to insist on a guaranteed end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, conditions Israel has previously rejected. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated he is committed to releasing hostages but also to eliminating Hamas's capabilities. The talks are expected to resume as mediators attempt to bridge the divide and end the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was completely destroyed in a large explosion after an SUV crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line. The driver and a passenger were rescued from the vehicle by two bystanders just minutes before the building was engulfed in flames and exploded. The blast, which was captured on video, also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses. Several people involved in the initial three-vehicle accident were hospitalized, but no one was inside the restaurant at the time and no injuries were reported from the explosion itself.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress against the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. Containment of the blaze, which has burned over 80,000 acres, increased to 30% thanks to an influx of personnel and more favorable weather conditions. The fire, which started Wednesday near the Santa Barbara County line, is threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument and has prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people. Officials are hopeful they can continue to bolster containment lines before a heat wave is expected to arrive midweek.</p>

          <h2>Washington Nationals Fire Manager Dave Martinez and GM Mike Rizzo Amid Losing Season</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The move came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Owner Mark Lerner stated that while he was grateful for their past success, a "fresh approach and new energy" was needed due to the team's poor on-field performance. Rizzo had been with the organization since 2009, building the championship roster, while Martinez managed the team to its first-ever title.</p>
