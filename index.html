          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man who allegedly stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect, Bradford James Gille, used a folding knife in what appeared to be a random attack before being confronted by armed citizens who held him until law enforcement arrived. The conditions of the victims, ranging in age from 21 to 84, are reportedly improving, with most now in fair condition. The FBI is assisting local police with the ongoing investigation into the motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>Despite controversy among some prominent conservative figures regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many Trump supporters in middle America remain unfazed. Interviews conducted in states like Pennsylvania and Tennessee suggest a segment of his base is loyal and dismisses the issue as a politically motivated distraction by Democrats and the media. These supporters prioritize what they see as the administration's successes on the economy and border security over the Epstein matter. However, polling data indicates a broader national concern, with a majority of Americans, including many Republicans, believing the government is hiding information.</p>

          <p>Following England's fourth Test against India, concerns are growing over captain Ben Stokes pushing his body to its limits despite visible physical strain. Cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew argues that it is past the point where coaches or teammates can intervene, and Stokes himself must realize the importance of self-preservation for the team's long-term success. His world-class bowling is crucial for England, especially with the Ashes approaching, but his continued exertion risks a significant injury. The article suggests that without a fully fit Stokes, England's chances in major upcoming series are massively diminished.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has reached a significant trade agreement with the European Union, establishing a 15% tariff on most European goods, a lower rate than the 30% previously threatened. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the United States. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that certain products, like aircraft and some pharmaceuticals, will be exempt from the new tariffs. The agreement averts a potential trade war and aims to bring more stability to the transatlantic economic relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

Late-night shows for NBC and ABC also operate at a loss based on traditional metrics but provide value through digital reach and marketing synergy.

          <p>An analysis by Ezra Klein suggests that Donald Trump is caught in a political dilemma of his own making regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Having built his political brand by fueling conspiracy theories about a secretive "deep state," Trump now presides over that same system and faces pressure from his base to reveal secrets about Epstein. His attempts to deflect or distract from the issue only deepen suspicion among a public already primed to believe in cover-ups. This situation presents a unique challenge for Trump, as he must navigate the expectations of supporters he conditioned to distrust the very institutions he now controls.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests Zelensky's Anti-Corruption Moves Echo Trump-Era Global Trends</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption agencies reflects a broader global shift away from good governance, enabled by the Trump administration. The article contends that the U.S. has systematically dismantled its own apparatus for promoting democracy and fighting kleptocracy abroad, sending a signal that pressure for reform is off. This has created a new global paradigm where leaders feel empowered to protect allies and themselves from scrutiny, with Zelensky's actions cited as evidence of even previously praised leaders adapting to this new reality.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Senators Urge Administration to Halt Funding for GHF and Restore Support for UN in Gaza</h2>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to cease U.S. funding for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed "grave" concerns over the GHF's operations, which they described as a "death trap" due to the high number of civilian casualties at its distribution sites. They are urging the administration to resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms to address the severe hunger crisis in Gaza. The letter also questions the administration's process for approving $30 million in funding for the GHF.</p>

          <p>Verdence Capital Advisors CIO Megan Horneman has warned that the stock market is "pricing in perfection" and may be overly complacent about several looming risks. In a CNBC interview, she highlighted uncertainty around the August 1st trade tariff deadline, potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy, and technically overbought conditions, especially in growth stocks. While she remains a long-term bull, Horneman anticipates a potential short-term valuation correction and sees pullbacks as buying opportunities. She advises investors to ensure their portfolios are appropriately allocated to navigate the potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow secure land routes for humanitarian aid amid a worsening hunger crisis. The pause will affect Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, aiming to increase the scale of aid entering the territory. This move follows intense global criticism over the humanitarian situation and images of starving children. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need, as aid agencies report that a third of Gaza's population is facing extreme hunger.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia to negotiate an end to four days of intense border clashes that have killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000. The talks follow diplomatic pressure from the U.S. to reach a ceasefire. The fighting, which flared up after a land mine explosion, is the latest eruption in a decades-long border dispute between the two nations. Despite the agreement to hold talks, both sides reported continued fighting on Sunday and traded accusations of escalating the conflict with artillery and troop movements.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamic State affiliate, has left dozens dead in the town of Komanda in northeastern DR Congo. Local officials report that about 20 of the victims were Christian worshippers attending a night vigil at a church when the militants struck, with other bodies found elsewhere in the town. The attackers also looted and burned nearby shops and businesses. The ADF, which originated in Uganda but is now based in DR Congo, regularly carries out attacks on civilians, contributing to ongoing instability in the mineral-rich region.</p>

          <p>Colombian forward Luis Diaz is set to transfer from Liverpool to Bayern Munich after the clubs agreed to a deal worth up to €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons. The 28-year-old was left out of Liverpool's recent pre-season friendly due to the speculation and has been given permission to complete his medical with the German champions. Diaz joined Liverpool from Porto in 2022 and had his most prolific season last year, scoring 17 goals across all competitions. His departure comes as Liverpool looks to reshape its forward line with new summer signings.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a successful weekend as two of its major films, "Superman" and Apple's "F1," each crossed the $500 million mark at the global box office.

For Apple, the box office performance of "F1," which Warner Bros. distributes, makes it the tech company's highest-grossing theatrical release to date, far surpassing its previous films and demonstrating the value of its cinematic partnerships.</p>
