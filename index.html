          <p>The United States and Iran are set to resume high-level discussions in Oman to address disputes over Tehran's nuclear program. The US insists Iran cease uranium enrichment, a stance considered a red line, while Iran asserts its non-negotiable right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes. Both sides express a preference for diplomacy to resolve the issue, although significant disagreements remain. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested Iran import enriched uranium for civilian energy as a potential solution, but no resolution has been made as of yet.</p>

          <p>Former workers at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) warn that mass terminations and budget cuts are creating a "real danger" of missed disease outbreaks and disruptions to essential services. The cuts, driven by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency," have led to firings at state public health agencies and the dismantling of programs like Pepfar, which addresses HIV prevention. Concerns are mounting about the long-term impact on vulnerable children and families due to reduced child support enforcement and the potential for widespread health crises.</p>

          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) has released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging US cities for seasonal allergy sufferers. Wichita, Kansas, tops the list for the third consecutive year, due to high tree and grass pollen counts. The report also factors in over-the-counter allergy medicine use and allergist availability. Experts recommend starting medications early, washing clothes after outdoor exposure, and staying indoors during peak pollen times to manage allergy symptoms, noting that symptoms can mimic those of colds and viruses.</p>

          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge. In March, hybrid EV exports to the UK increased dramatically, highlighting a growing preference for these vehicles among British consumers. The UK remains a key export destination for Chinese EVs, benefiting from lower import tariffs compared to the European Union. This trend reflects a shift in consumer choices towards more affordable hybrid options amidst rising costs.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit due to lower crude prices and reduced production.

The report signals ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant as global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty affect energy markets.

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, encourages mothers to stop striving for perfection and cut themselves some slack. She argues that being flawed is a crucial part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Ross notes that the field of psychiatry has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, but it's time to acknowledge the immense credit mothers deserve. The article emphasizes that mothers are constantly bombarded with messages that they're not doing enough, leading to unnecessary guilt and self-doubt.</p>

This proposal follows threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if a ceasefire is not agreed upon. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously stated his readiness for peace talks, but only after a ceasefire is in place.</p>

He suggests the UK should have prioritized its relationship with the EU instead, arguing that working with the EU could have yielded better results. The trade deal includes reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports to the US, with the UK removing a tariff on ethanol.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has arrived in China for a state visit, during which Beijing voiced opposition to the “bullying” of Latin America and unilateral sanctions against countries in the region.

          <p>Cuts to USAID funding by the Trump administration are significantly impacting healthcare and humanitarian efforts across Africa. HIV patients are losing access to medication, and healthcare programs have been halted, potentially leading to over 500,000 deaths in South Africa alone over the next decade. Amref Health Africa has lost a significant portion of its budget, leading to canceled educational programs and reduced tuberculosis screenings. Experts fear these cuts could undo years of progress in disease prevention and treatment, with a potential resurgence of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has praised the first day of high-level trade talks between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland, describing a "total reset" in US-China trade relations. He stated the talks were "very good" and that change had been "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner." The meetings aim to de-escalate the trade war, which has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports and China retaliate with levies of 125% on some US goods. Despite the positive remarks, Washington maintains it will not lower tariffs unilaterally, requiring concessions from China.</p>

          <p>Opposition politicians are disputing claims that Birmingham's bin collections have returned to normal, as industrial action by Unite union members continues. While the city council asserts it has cleared most of the rubbish, Conservative leader Robert Alden and Independent MP Ayoub Khan claim bin lorries have stalled, leading to waste accumulation. The strike, triggered by a dispute over changes to roles and pay, has garnered international attention due to images of waste piles and concerns about public health. The local authority maintains it has cleared a high percentage of waste, but recycling collections remain suspended.</p>
