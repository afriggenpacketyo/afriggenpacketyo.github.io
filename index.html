        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have confirmed the details of a trade framework aimed at resolving ongoing commercial disputes. According to China's Ministry of Commerce, the agreement will involve China reviewing export control applications while the U.S. removes certain restrictive measures. This development follows high-level talks in London and seeks to implement a previous consensus reached in Geneva. While the move is seen as a positive step in stabilizing the relationship, experts caution that ambiguities remain, particularly concerning the extent of relaxed curbs on rare earth exports.</p>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The surge was driven by investor relief after the White House indicated a potential extension of the 90-day pause on certain U.S. tariffs. The market's positive momentum was also supported by a holding ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which eased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The broader Topix index also saw significant gains, reflecting widespread optimism in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Department of Homeland Security expert has warned that 'agroterrorism' from foreign adversaries like China could severely disrupt the U.S. food supply and national security. The concern follows the recent arrest of two Chinese nationals accused of smuggling a crop-killing fungus, Fusarium graminearum, into the country. The expert, Kristofor Healey, explained that intentionally introducing such biological organisms targets the foundation of the U.S. agricultural economy. He stressed that this form of terrorism attacks the civilian population by threatening the food chain and critical infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car production plummeted to its lowest level for the month of May since 1949, excluding the pandemic lockdown period. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), output fell by nearly a third compared to the previous year, with only 49,810 units produced. The sharp decline is largely attributed to new 25% U.S. tariffs, which caused exports to the American market to halve as manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover suspended shipments. There is cautious optimism, however, as a deal to reduce these tariffs is expected by the end of June.</p>

          <p>President Trump's intensified crackdown on immigration is causing concern among U.S. businesses that rely on foreign-born workers, threatening to disrupt a critical component of the nation's labor force. With immigrants accounting for a record high of nearly one in five U.S. workers, companies in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction report losing employees due to revoked work permits and fear of deportation. Economists warn that a shrinking workforce could slow economic growth, fuel inflation, and create significant labor shortages in key industries that already struggle to find staff.</p>

          <p>Profits for China's major industrial firms experienced a significant 9.1% year-on-year decline in May, the largest drop since last October. The National Bureau of Statistics attributes this downturn to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods. The data reveals a cumulative profit decrease of 1.1% for the first five months of the year, with state-owned firms and the automotive sector seeing notable drops. This trend suggests that Beijing's previous stimulus measures have not fully revitalized corporate profitability amid ongoing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer approaches his first anniversary in office, his government is navigating significant domestic and international crises. After a landslide election victory, Labour's honeymoon period was short-lived, marked by an over-cautious agenda, internal tensions, and public backlash over policies like cuts to winter fuel payments. The government has also contended with riots and questions about the Prime Minister's leadership style. Despite these challenges, Starmer has found a more defined role on the world stage, acting as a diplomatic bridge between the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales in May rose by 6.9 percent from the previous year, reaching 898,721 units and setting a new record for the month. The company attributed the strong performance in part to a surge in last-minute demand in the United States. This spike was driven by consumer concerns that car prices would increase due to high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. In contrast to the sales growth, Toyota's global production for the same month saw a slight dip of 0.7 percent, its first year-on-year decline in five months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has officially approved evacuation plans for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture, a critical step toward potentially restarting the facility. Operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant has been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The approval from the national government's nuclear disaster prevention council, chaired by the Prime Minister, now shifts the focus to securing local consent from residents. This remains the final and most significant hurdle before the world's largest nuclear plant can resume operations.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil, signed in 1975, continues to exist despite Germany's nuclear phase-out and ongoing controversy. The deal originally aimed to build eight nuclear plants in Brazil but has resulted in only one operational plant, Angra-2, and one unfinished site, Angra-3. Critics and Green Party politicians in Germany have long called for its termination, citing safety concerns and its outdated nature. However, with a global resurgence in nuclear power and shifting political landscapes in both countries, the future of the historic but troubled pact remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, prominent economists have called for China to enact structural reforms to transition towards a consumption-driven economy. They argue that while China has made technological strides, its long-term prosperity depends on increasing domestic consumption rather than relying solely on production-focused subsidies. An over-reliance on exports could create trade friction with the rest of the world. Experts suggest that reorienting local government priorities to include consumption metrics could help harmonize trade relationships and unlock new growth in the services sector.
