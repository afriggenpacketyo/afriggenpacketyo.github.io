          <p>This article examines the impact of the US government shutdown on Martinsburg, West Virginia, a town heavily reliant on federal agencies. The shutdown has disrupted programs for veterans, closed a USDA service center, and threatens further job losses, exacerbating existing economic challenges. Residents express frustration with the political gridlock in Washington and its perceived lack of concern for everyday Americans. Despite community efforts to mitigate the effects, such as rerouting a local race, the shutdown's impact on small businesses and federal workers is a significant concern. The article paints a picture of a community struggling with uncertainty and the consequences of political inaction.</p>

          <p>This article discusses concerns raised by former national security official David Feith regarding Chinese entities acquiring land near US military bases. Feith warns of potential espionage and military threats, citing Ukraine's drone attack in Russia as an example of a new way of war. While Chinese nationals own a small percentage of US agricultural land, politicians are taking notice, with many states limiting or banning foreign ownership. The Trump Agriculture Department plans to increase transparency and impose harsher penalties for false reporting on foreign land ownership. Feith also highlights the risk of Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining operations being used for espionage or sabotaging the electric grid. </p>

          <p>Andrew Ross Sorkin cautions about a potential economic bubble fueled by artificial intelligence, drawing parallels to the 1929 market crash. He notes that the AI boom is artificially propping up the economy, with massive investments creating uncertainty about whether it's a gold rush or a sugar rush. Sorkin points out that regulations put in place after 1929 to protect investors are being dismantled, increasing speculation and debt in the market. He highlights the trend of democratizing finance, allowing ordinary Americans to invest in risky private companies with fewer regulations, potentially leading to financial instability. </p>

          <p>University of Sussex psychologists are using thermal cameras to study stress by monitoring facial temperature changes.

Researchers believe this technique could help manage harmful stress levels and monitor stress in babies or those unable to communicate.
