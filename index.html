          <p>Across the United States, people gathered to remember George Floyd on the fifth anniversary of his death, marking the event with services and commemorations in Houston and Minneapolis. Floyd's death in 2020, caused by a police officer kneeling on his neck, ignited global protests against racism and police brutality. Reverend Al Sharpton led a service in Houston, Floyd's hometown, advocating for continued police reform. While some view Floyd's death as a catalyst for national reckoning, concerns remain about the rollback of police reforms, underscoring the ongoing struggle for racial justice.</p>

          <p>The Argentine comic 'El Eternauta,' a dystopian drama about a group of friends battling a deadly snowfall, has gained international recognition with its Netflix adaptation. The series, which premiered on April 30, reached number one among Netflix's most-watched series, prompting renewal for a second season. Written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld in 1957, the comic resonates deeply in Argentina, where Oesterheld and his daughters were 'disappeared' during the military dictatorship. The renewed interest has publishers scrambling to reprint translated editions, reflecting anxieties about the current state of Argentine society under President Javier Milei.</p>

          <p>Ministers are facing increased pressure to resume processing Syrian asylum applications, as over 7,000 individuals remain in a state of uncertainty. The UK suspended decisions on Syrian claims following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad, leaving many Syrians without a clear timeline for assessment. Charities are advocating for a case-by-case review, while the government cites the need for stable information to assess risks for those returning to Syria. The situation has left many Syrians unable to work and reliant on government support, exacerbating the backlog in the asylum system.</p>
