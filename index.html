          <p>An effort in the Senate to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely united in opposition. The resolution, led by Senators Wyden and Paul, would have terminated the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The article notes that the vote came after Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on most U.S. trading partners, followed by a 90-day pause on most new tariffs. House Republican leadership has also taken steps to quash efforts to block the tariffs.</p>
