          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted reports that the Trump administration is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies like IonQ and Rigetti Computing. The denial followed a Wall Street Journal article that caused the stocks of several quantum firms to rise. While the administration has previously taken equity in industries deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, officials state no such talks are currently underway for the quantum sector, which remains largely in a pre-revenue research phase.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance who pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in 2023. The White House justified the decision by stating Zhao was prosecuted as part of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency" and that the case damaged the U.S.'s reputation for innovation. The pardon also comes as Zhao has reportedly been involved in boosting a cryptocurrency company launched by Trump's sons.</p>

Mamdani confronted Cuomo regarding the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor, while Cuomo criticized Mamdani for his perceived lack of experience and ties to radical politics. The heated exchanges largely overshadowed policy discussions, with social media commentary highlighting the aggressive tactics from both sides as they made their final pitches to voters.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is moving away from its long-standing identity as a discount carrier by introducing a series of premium travel-focused changes. The airline will eliminate its signature open-boarding policy in favor of assigned seating starting in 2026 and has already begun charging for checked bags. These updates, which also include new cabins with extra legroom, bigger bins, and improved Wi-Fi, are designed to make the airline more competitive but will result in higher costs for flyers seeking these amenities.</p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers have been fired after a BBC Panorama investigation exposed their misconduct, including the use of highly racist and discriminatory language. PC Philip Neilson was found to have made abhorrent remarks about ethnic groups and migrants, while PC Martin Borg was recorded enthusiastically describing inappropriate use of force. Both were dismissed with immediate effect following accelerated misconduct hearings, with a panel chair describing their conduct as an "utter disgrace" that harmed public confidence in policing.</p>

          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the Kenyan athlete who holds the women's marathon world record, has been banned from the sport for three years after testing positive for a prohibited diuretic. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) rejected her explanation that she had inadvertently taken her housemaid's medication. Because the failed test occurred after her record-setting run in Chicago, she will be allowed to keep her world record, a decision likely to be controversial. The AIU is also investigating other suspicious material found on her phone.</p>

          <p>Government watchdog groups have warned that a top federal prosecutor's use of an encrypted messaging app with an auto-delete function may have been illegal. Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, reportedly used Signal with messages set to disappear after eight hours while discussing a government case with a journalist. Critics argue this practice could violate the Federal Records Act and DOJ policy, which require the preservation of official communications, prompting calls for an investigation.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 1.5% in September, reaching their highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. The increase is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers, particularly first-time purchasers. However, housing inventory remains historically lean, which continues to put upward pressure on prices, with the median home price rising 2.1% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave, known as a "blob," in the north-western and central Pacific Ocean, where August temperatures were 2.5°C above preindustrial levels. This phenomenon could lead to increased thunderstorms and flooding in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and potentially contribute to harsher winter weather in eastern North America. Experts note that these heatwaves have become more frequent and intense over the past decade, posing significant risks to marine ecosystems and affecting regional weather patterns.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government facing another potential shutdown, this article provides a historical overview of the 14 times federal funding has lapsed since 1980. The practice of shutting down agencies during funding gaps became standard after legal opinions in the early 1980s, with President Ronald Reagan overseeing eight such events. The frequency of shutdowns has increased over the past decade, often stemming from intense partisan battles over issues like healthcare, immigration, and budget deficits, with significant economic consequences.</p>
