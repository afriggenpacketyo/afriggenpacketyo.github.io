          <p>Intel's stock value decreased after former President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of the company's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump asserted that Tan is "highly CONFLICTED" and must step down, leading to a premarket drop of over 4% for the chipmaker's shares. This direct intervention highlights the significant impact that political statements can have on corporate stability and market performance, creating uncertainty for investors. The pressure on the semiconductor giant reflects a volatile intersection of politics and the technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Eli Lilly's stock saw a premarket dip after data from its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, did not meet high Wall Street expectations.

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a wide-ranging set of new tariffs, affecting imports from more than 90 countries. The move is part of a strategy to bolster domestic manufacturing and renegotiate global trade relationships, which the administration views as unfair to the U.S. These import taxes vary, with some of the highest rates applied to nations like Laos and Myanmar. The policy has also been used to exert political pressure, such as threatening India with higher duties over its trade with Russia, creating significant turmoil in the global economy.

The connected fitness company announced it would cut an additional 6% of its staff to reduce operating expenses by another $100 million, on top of previous cost-saving measures. Despite a 6% drop in sales, the company's net income reached $21.6 million, a significant improvement from the previous year's loss. The results indicate that Peloton's efforts to stabilize its finances are yielding positive results, though it faces headwinds from new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new federal report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that a majority of Americans derive more than half of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. The study, conducted between August 2021 and August 2023, found that youth consumed 61.9% and adults 53.0% of their calories from these sources, which include items like burgers, pizza, and sweetened beverages. Health officials link high consumption of these foods to increased risks of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. The findings have prompted a federal effort to establish a uniform definition for ultra-processed foods to better inform public health guidelines.</p>

The 5–4 decision reflects a deep division among policymakers, who are balancing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. While the cut was widely anticipated, the close vote highlights the uncertainty surrounding the UK's economic path. Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized the need to avoid cutting rates too quickly, suggesting future reductions will remain gradual and dependent on disinflationary trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its launch by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett, The Giving Pledge has seen a slowdown in new signatories. The initiative, which asks billionaires to commit at least half their wealth to charity, initially attracted 40 of America's richest families. However, a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies notes that the percentage of U.S. billionaires who have signed on has slightly decreased over time. While the pledge has been credited with changing norms around generosity, critics argue it has not kept pace with the rapid growth of billionaire wealth.</p>

Conversely, savers will face lower returns on their deposits, as average savings rates are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's action is aimed at stimulating spending to manage inflation, which currently stands above the 2% target, while also considering the state of the jobs market.

Experts warn this will disproportionately harm children, who constitute nearly half of all Medicaid enrollees.

          <p>The humanitarian crisis in Gaza, marked by widespread malnutrition and famine, is being analyzed as a modern example of starvation used as a weapon of war. This article details how from the outset of the conflict, Israeli officials announced a "complete siege," blocking food, water, and fuel, which human rights groups argue is a deliberate and systematic policy. Unlike historical famines linked to climate or other factors, the situation in Gaza is described as entirely human-made, with Israel controlling all entry points for aid. This has led to indictments from the International Criminal Court and raises critical questions about collective punishment under international law.</p>

With the Indian opposition unified against what it calls "economic blackmail," India appears prepared to protect its key sectors, such as agriculture, even at a significant economic cost.

          <p>This article explores the cultural and political history of survivalism, tracing its roots from 1970s counter-culture to the modern "prepper" movement embraced by Silicon Valley billionaires. It examines how survivalist stories, from "Robinson Crusoe" to "The Last of Us," shape our understanding of human nature in a crisis, often promoting a bleak, individualistic worldview. The analysis contrasts the heroic problem-solving survivor with the paranoid survivalist who craves societal collapse. Ultimately, it questions the genre's pessimistic outlook, citing real-world disaster studies that show mutual aid and cooperation are often more common responses than brutal competition.</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China needs to maintain an annual GDP growth rate of at least 4.5% over the next five years. Writing in the Study Times, Professor Cui Youping argued that a rate of "around 5 percent" would be ideal to achieve the country's goal of reaching the per capita GDP of "moderately developed countries" by 2035. This politically significant target, set during the 20th Party Congress, requires substantial and consistent economic expansion. The article also highlighted technological advancement and improving citizens' livelihoods as key priorities for the upcoming 15th five-year plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political movement on Israel's far-right is methodically working to annex the Gaza Strip and re-establish Jewish settlements, a goal that has gained support from over a third of the lawmakers in the current government coalition. Despite opposition from the Israeli security establishment and the general public, Prime Minister Netanyahu is seen as beholden to these far-right partners to maintain his government. The movement has escalated its efforts with calls to allow activists to scout settlement locations in northern Gaza. This agenda, which critics warn includes the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, is effectively becoming government policy, removing previous obstacles to its implementation.</p>

          <p>Following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth and significant downward revisions for previous months, President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Erika McEntarfer. Trump called the data "a scam" and alleged political manipulation, a claim widely refuted by economists. The move has sparked a backlash and raised fears about the integrity of U.S. economic data. Experts worry that replacing the commissioner with a political appointee could undermine the credibility of crucial statistics that businesses, the Federal Reserve, and global markets rely on for decision-making.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines seven financial practices common among the boomer generation that are not widely adopted by millennials, largely due to different economic realities. These habits include prioritizing buying a home over renting, relying on pensions and Social Security for retirement, and staying with one employer for an entire career. Millennials, having faced multiple economic crises, are adapting with different strategies, such as job-hopping for higher pay and utilizing a wider array of investment tools. The shift reflects a generational divide in financial planning, driven by changes in housing affordability, job security, and retirement systems.</p>

Popeyes was the weakest performer in the portfolio, reporting a decline in same-store sales. Burger King's U.S. division showed modest same-store sales growth, indicating some progress in its ongoing turnaround efforts, while the company reiterated its long-term growth forecast.

The announcement came as Trump praised Apple for a new $100 billion U.S. investment pledge. This sector-specific tariff represents a significant escalation in the administration's strategy to reshore critical technology supply chains and bolster domestic production.

          <p>Rushanara Ali, the UK's minister for homelessness, is facing accusations of hypocrisy after reportedly raising the rent on a house she owns by £700 per month. The increase allegedly occurred shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended, and they were given four months' notice that their lease would not be renewed. A source close to the minister stated she complied with all legal requirements and that the tenants chose to leave. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from political opponents and renters' advocacy groups, who highlight the apparent contradiction between her public role and private actions as a landlord.</p>

          <p>A fabricated story claiming that three senior British military officers were captured by Russian special forces in Ukraine has been debunked as disinformation. The narrative, which spread across social media and was shared by two former British politicians, used demonstrably AI-generated images and featured names of officers who do not exist in UK military records. Experts identify the story as a typical Russian disinformation campaign, designed to be seeded on fringe websites and "laundered" through various channels to create a false sense of credibility. The primary goal is likely to bolster domestic Russian morale and promote the trope of Western puppeteering in the war.</p>

While a face-to-face summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could signal a breakthrough in ending the Ukraine war, it could also be a strategic maneuver by the Kremlin to diffuse pressure from Washington. Russian state media has already framed the talks as a victory for Putin, suggesting he "bought time" ahead of a U.S. deadline for a ceasefire. The meeting's substance remains in question, with analysts noting it may be more for show than for achieving a concrete resolution.</p>
