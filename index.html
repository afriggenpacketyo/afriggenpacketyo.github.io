          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is reportedly also advocating for reforms at the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and organically shrink its large bond portfolio. The process occurs as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for interest rate cuts ahead of its upcoming policy meeting.</p>

          <p>Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that tariffs are contributing to price increases for everyday consumer goods like apparel, electronics, and groceries. This trend is creating a squeeze on middle-class households at a time when the labor market is showing signs of fragility. While economists traditionally view tariffs as a temporary price shock, the persistent inflation poses a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which must balance rising costs with a slowing economy.

          <p>At its annual event, Apple unveiled the new iPhone 17 lineup, featuring price hikes across all models despite recently receiving tariff relief from the Trump administration. The company introduced the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, a redesigned iPhone 17 Pro, and updated Apple Watch and AirPods Pro models with new health and AI features. By raising prices, Apple is reinforcing its premium brand identity, signaling that it is passing innovation costs to consumers rather than leveraging tariff breaks for savings.</p>

          <p>New estimates based on August inflation data suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would represent a modest increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025, raising the average monthly retirement check by about $54. However, retirees express concern that the adjustment may not be sufficient to cover rising expenses, particularly with potential increases in Medicare premiums also expected for the upcoming year.

          <p>Medical care costs rose 4.2% annually in August, outpacing the overall inflation rate and fueling projections for the largest jump in employer health spending in 15 years. Large employers anticipate a 9% rise in health coverage costs for 2026, driven by hospital services and high-priced prescription drugs like those for cancer and obesity. This trend is increasing pressure on companies, who may pass more costs to employees, and forcing consumers to seek more affordable options for medications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American infrastructure projects funded by a $550 billion Japanese investment. This arrangement is part of a broader trade deal where Japan agreed to the investment in exchange for a 15% baseline tariff rate. Once Japan recoups its initial investment, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., which will then receive 90% of the profits, helping to fund domestic manufacturing priorities.</p>

          <p>With FICO set to incorporate 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loan data into credit scores this fall, consumers are being urged to manage their BNPL debt to avoid negative impacts. A recent survey shows nearly half of BNPL users have missed a payment, a risk that will soon carry greater consequences for their credit ratings. Financial experts recommend strategies such as debt consolidation with a personal loan, balance transfers to 0% APR cards, or creating a strategic repayment plan to regain control before the new reporting rules take effect.

          <p>For the first time during the Ukraine war, NATO forces engaged potential threats in allied airspace, intercepting 19 suspected Russian drones that entered Poland. Polish authorities are treating the incident as a deliberate provocation rather than an accident, prompting the invocation of NATO's Article 4 for joint consultation. The incursion is seen as a significant escalation, potentially a Russian attempt to probe NATO's air defenses and sow division among allies supporting Ukraine.</p>

The emails show Mandelson advising Epstein on his legal strategy and expressing strong personal support just before Epstein was sentenced for soliciting a minor in 2008. The revelations prompted outrage and forced the Prime Minister's hand, despite Mandelson's previously acknowledged friendship with the disgraced financier.</p>

The falling rates are attributed to signs of a weakening labor market, which has caused the Treasury yields that influence mortgage rates to move lower. (not investment advice)</p>

The ruling affirms that such force is prohibited unless necessary to stop an immediate and serious threat of physical harm, stating that the First Amendment demands better protection.</p>
