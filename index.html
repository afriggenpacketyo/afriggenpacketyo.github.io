          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump signed a memorandum to address the "lawlessness" in California. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and likely to escalate tensions. The protests and the federal response highlight the ongoing conflict surrounding immigration policies and enforcement in the region, with both sides accusing the other of inflaming the situation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders emphasize the importance of work-life balance and sustainable innovation. They argue that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources, not longer working hours. Concerns are also raised about the negative impact of overwork on employee retention and well-being.</p>
