          <p>Graduate students at Nagoya University have created the OD Checker, a cane-like device that measures orthostatic dysregulation symptoms in children.  The device uses a finger sensor to measure heart rate changes when standing, aiding in diagnosis and communication of symptoms to school officials.  This innovation aims to improve understanding and support for children experiencing this common disorder, potentially leading to better school attendance. The team is seeking private sector support to finalize the prototype and market the device.</p>
